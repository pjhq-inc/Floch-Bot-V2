i love unannounced visits from relatives
i have to deal with this bullshit now
does the fact its 21.73mb mean anything or no
wait i just realized
@ZeldaLord should i just play it i cant really get ratted
he has access to my account already
can ratting do more than just access to ssid
which he alr has
ok
im finally on pc
what now
how.
where do i extract the files
are you SURE nothing bad can happen if i download the zip only
ok downloaded

@ZeldaLord ...
i deleted it and it showed the contents

isnt that exposing myself to the potential rat
what can happen if i open the zip
100% sure? im about to open it

its only this
is it normal that the only mod is optifine
.

i downloaded optifine 1.19.4 from optifine website
now how do i see
how many kb a download is
ok so is that the same thing
how the fuck is it not a rat
he was literally "i made this modpack lets play"
and he is STILL spamming me to go play it
which i can change in 15 seconds
he doesnt know how to get a session id btw (f3 + c crash log)
so i can boot him off at anytime
you know what this motherfucker literally backstabbed me and leaked very private shit to my #1 opp
im gonna "gift the account to him", take a vacation from skyblock, hes gonna completely max the account and then i boot him off and delete the profile
@ZeldaLord is there any way it could still be a rat btw

a very important character in japan bullshit died
it was very sad
the manga writer is evil and tortures everyone by killing fan favorite characters
he just pulled out a character who hasnt appeared since 2020 so the manga can continue happening
the edit he just made today
is a character who appeared a few weeks ago after not appearing since 2018
vravo bince
me and benny went insane after "gojo satoru" died
hes the best character
he was everyones favorite
this is his death
he is the nah id win guy btw
the irony of nah id win is that he actually lost
thats the entire joke.
yes literally that
idk
he got cut in half
from what? an asspull move
benny definitely showed you some very nsfw femboy pictures right
did you ever hear of kashimo
im timeouted AGAIN

the fact other people were schizo made me keep going

anyways everything is setup now i go to sleep while ark is installing
what the fuck
about what
gojo is literally dead
he is
i finally realized gojo is dead so i dropped the series
and carrot still thinks gojo will be back
hes the one coping
you dont understand it zelda
its a sensitive topic
you cant just call it "one guy dying"
thats so insensitive of you like what the fuck
yes its true
but we miss gojo the most
he was everyones favorite
the main villain is the only one who never dies
the author glazes him
yes it is
sigma
he copes i dont
last chapter the "guy who died" some kid used some bullshit to transfer his brain into the "guy who died"'s body which confirms hes dead
thats why i dropped the series
i fucking hate Luta
hes the fraud of frauds
he can never be Wojo Waturo
the "guy who died"
cabal him
block him
send people to his house
?????????????????????????????????
also hes trying to cover up the existence of this
automod got me
untimeout me so i can send one message then u can retimeout me
hi
its been 15 HOURS
i want to talk to carrot
he cant untimeout me because gooner god role
ill stop saying pex shit
its been 20 HOURS
im bored as shit
ill stop mentioning pex
are you doing lexical company
how many people
just you and benny?
why are you awake
at 4 am
im just chilling in a call rn
it started as a 30s call at midnight "before sleep"
(sleep will not be happening)
hello
i would like to vote for the death of mr hammers in stock
also i have purchased lethal company ill play tomorrow
get him to play
lethal so fun
especially artifice
no ben why
thatd be so unfun
bens schizophrenia would add to the fun so much
pixel sent maid adachi
no he thankfully didnt dm me
can pixel just die or something
adachi obsession is one thing but maid adachi made me genuinely want to die
can you unarchive the rot and contain pixel in there
what motivates him to do this
cant he fight his retarded brother like you fight your retarded kitten
its 2am in egypt too yk
does he not like have better stuff to do like SLEEPING????
actually no noone in pj sleeps
were all always awake at 4am
but still he could do something more productive
ben doesnt sleep either
hes always on at like 4am
the burnt toast shit was probably a persona reference or something
Genius!
I got chat reported for stealing 40 glass on an smp!
I said die one time!
I will now coopsalvage and sell the account
im tempted to doxx and get wiped the nwords who did this to me
nah long term ill win
im gonna make a fucking google doc
i think the record is over
let me talk
i just left all the other skyblock related servers i was in and now im bored
let me talk already
??????
what the fuck is he talking about
????????????????????????????????????????
no it is in fact not
why are you acting like i know why pixel is like he is
my mc skin is uhhhhhh
DONT LOOK IT UP
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????
WHAT THE FUCK DOES THIS MEAN
who the fuck is doorkun
i dont either
oh its some persona shit
i thought it was some pixel made up bullshit
yea
if we dont give him attention maybe hell stop
??????????
what is that
is that some persona character
how
just ignore his dms and ignore his pj brainrot
and hell stop
why is he evolving

???
what is he cooking
the pj pixels schizophrenia treatment gofundme
?????????????????
like ill play it or look at it
💀
???????
zelda explain
what the fuck is " adachi's slugpup "
ISNT ADACHI FROFM PERSONA
WHY IS HE EVEN MAKING A GAME
HOW OLD IS PIXEL
IS HE LIKE 20 AND HAS NOTHING BETTER TO DO
does he not have school and shit
or vacation
you must be in a really low position in life to be making a "PJ GAME"
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
why is he not banned yet
WHAT IS HIS PROBLEM
zelda things have went too far
NO
I DONT WANT TO SEE THAT
how sure are you
hes sent a fucking maid adachi
anything exists.
can you blacklist adachi in automod
and remove pixels bypasses
if he actually sends a twerking adachi sometime you are paying for my therapy too
if im not there i cant see his bullshit
its so annoying
hes such an attention seeker
Hello, ZeldaLord.
I have requested my friend whos from France to say "Miserable"
I will keep you updated.
You will be receiving a recording of it soon.
i need more narcoberries and spoiled meat to prepare the tranquilizing arrows so i can safely kidnap him
then ill go kill pixel
do i tranquilize pixel too and bring him to benny melks shack?
inv me to pj
why did he dm you that

feminine
is pixel gay???
the other version is more miserable tho
pixels fragile ego
whats even the difference
that looks like a 14 year old tiktok addicted emo "the world is broken beyond repair nothing matters 💔" "self diagnosed depressed" girl as pixelated_face
good job you cooked
make him use it
triest
zelda
any hint towards the code on the computer
i have looked inside the clover doc and the readme doc
i cannot find shit
i need a slight hint
mastersilly was bringing peopel from skyblock furries
theres probably like 15 people from there in pj by now
oh ok
also oneshot is pure peak
prob gonna do undertale soon too i hope its as good
is """""mafinam""""" in pj
oh ok
is this you
zelda how do i play pancake episode
i downloaded it
i extracted everything in the .exe
but stupid windows thing blocks me
this shit
me and my friend are like being retarded right now
he said he "cant open it as admin"
also is that like windows 5 or something
ok what in here do i do
"""**Open**""" opens it in windows explorer
i already told you
this is what happens
this is right click
this is left click
OH
I NEED TO BE SENT TO A MENTAL ASYLUM
my account share just sent me this
he got fucking infected because i forgot to swap off skin
doesnt matter i play ark
i havent been on skyblock myself this month yet
i also play lethal and phasmo
its like 2/3 ark 1/3 those
gonna do undertale and terraria soon
and buying subnautica in 3d
no he will say rain world
did you get it during the sale or smt
im so glad the sale had oneshot i wouldve never otherwise bought it because i thought it was shit (its pure 100% peak)
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT IMAGE
HOW DO YOU MANAGE
ITS AN OBVIOUS TROLL BUT WHAT THE FUCK DID HE DO THAT CPU
?????????????????
mb my accshare is retarded
i watched him do that on stream 😭
why are you on hypixel tho
play a good game like ark
its literally a waiting simulator right now
ok just try to ignore my ign
did you actually never see it
it was some gif saying "some persona character looking at some other persona character's ass after not eating for idfk how many days" then its someone eating a watermelon
how did you never see it he sent it SO MANY times
does pixel use reddit
leclown v2 he will edate a adachi cosplayer
WHY THE FUCK DOES THAT EXIST
isnt persona like expensive and pixel broke as fuck
how did he even get into persona
is adachi the finger of persona
i mean kinda same just with nah id win instead of true
except i stopped after like 2 weeks and pixel has been doing this for months
what the fuck
how have you not blocked him
yes of course this is the fucking sub banner
is he actually mentally ill
do you
want to see
the
top post
of the
subreddit
your choice to open or not
(do not)
why do i recognize most top posts
he literally
spammed all top posts
lmao
what is persona about
is this
like lore
or made up shit like ud see on okbc
yes
stockhameric humor
OH MY FUCKING GOD
yea
the adachi subreddit is motivating me to buy a rope
if i sent you just one of those posts you would shoot yourself
even worse than what pixel posts
its peak unfunniness and brainrot]
of course he fucking did
do you want an example of it
this is literally pixels humor
pixel inherited his sense of humor from that fucking subreddit
there is nah id win brainrot there
if pixel ever discovers posts like this (DO NOT OPEN IT) its pjover
yea im done
im done
never opening that subreddit again
im fucking done.
???
exist
he seeks attention from anyone possible
i mentioned i hate adachi like 3 times and he started spamming
you did NOT see ben in 2022
he was like as bad as pixel
what the fuck
i was calling it out..
what was it
yes...
what the fuck
i knew he was the one who added "hi faggot!"
so blatantly obvious
WHAT
..
what did he do now
NO
oh the wgc
the sad thing is i basically eat melons every day
and i dont wanna be reminded of that shit
and my pfp also has a melon
pixel
pixel does
@ZeldaLord
i am killing myself
WHAT IS A """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""wafflesona"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
WHAT. IS. IT.
it might be time
to take action
a
actually let me spoiler it
it gets far worse
like watermelon
imagine looking out of your window and a floating miserable pumpkin starts talking about adachis ass
oh i thought you meant this in his pfp
what does he need that for
wait so this is a long running thing????
when did he start """""""""""""""""""""""timeout"""""""""""""""""""""""
did he even make any progress on it
or is it his schizophrenic idea hell never make
why is he ripping off oneshot
no oneshot is not "canon to it" hes just stealing ideas
why did he want that
what the fuck is wrong with pixel
what iis it with today that makes him so retarded
I WAS LOOKING AT A VIDEO OF OG ONESHOT GAME
PIXEL HAS RUINED SO MANY THINGS
true
that can be made
in inspect element
in 2 seconds
i could edit igblon saying he wants to commit the holocaust in 2 seconds
its obviously fake
did pixel seriously read jjk just to torture you more effectively
his usual adachi shit
pixel should ultrakillhimself
why are you on dnd
you are never on dnd
the mute conversation in question
im changing my pfp to this when pixel returns from jail
actually no
right now
WHAT
>>>>>>>>>>>
?????????
i will be forced to utilize my last stand against pixel if this continues
giving my completely unhinged FRENCH friend his discord
after that, noone knows what can happen
its the only thing that can defeat pixel
i was on persona okbc
i saw horrible things
you told me about it
curiousity, zelda.
i saw horrors beyond human comprehensions
i looked at like 5 posts, went to look for a shotgun then went back on discord because i found none
cant hang myself as there is no ropes and i live in a house so i cannot jump off anything
WHAT
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
i will change it to the melon cat with the miserable pumpkin as its face
THATS
THE NAH ID WIN GUY
do you like it zelda
oh my god
did you start ignoring pixel right now by any chance?
he just started dming me
he sent me the same
image
ye
>>>>>>>>
??????????????????????
the persona okbc ?
wghat the fuck
btw zelda if pixel is on the oneshot subreddit he has serious problems
i checked it out one day and its literally just fucking niko thirst trap arts
niko is **8** fyi
maybe because
he posts on it
thats it im making a trans zeldalord skin
i shouldve never told my accshare about the existence of pj
nevermind it was in relation to some skyblock shit "andrej" did not ring a bell for him
you flexing your ac on me
eta of 1 month because im very lazy
and busy with ark
floppa doesnt have an iconic skin
BRO
AVERAGE EGYPTIAN
AHHAHAHA
bro what
would pixel like freeze to death on the flight from egypt to somewhere else
did he schizopost yet
im gonna go to sleep before he goes insane again
he leaves me alone if im not online
its probably something like the joker gif
i dont think he makes those himself he finds them on the persona okbc ripoff
no like smt similar
not a gif
dont
good thing i went to sleep at 9pm
im not reading that
he is probably trying to build trust so he can show you actual fucked up shit with you falling for it
he is insane enough for that
yes?
rw?
what then
HOW IS THERE ADACHI ON THE DARK SOULS OKBC
I DIDNT EVEN CONSIDER THAT
LIKE I INSTANTLY WENT
"nah its defintiely some rw shit it cant be adachi"
I KNOW
even i never went on japan brainrot subreddits unless it was to spam someone..
The Rot
which are
bro
oh god
oh god
???
im infecting people
its spreading
hes so retarded already
pixel just dmd me "hello pregnant waffle" and deleted it
he sent me this
idk if its even weird
im just sending random shit from the sub without looking at it
he sent me this to be fair
idk
and i don wanna know
just top posts from the persona okbc
idk i didnt even look
like 10 images
from the top posts
which he probably already saw like 50 times
i stopped like 10 minutes ago
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
what in the actual fuck
what in the genuine fuck
what the fuck
first is a japan reference
yes
yes it is
neither do i
its "Jack Frost" from "Megami Tensei"
hope that helps
i have no idea what that means
are you saying that because its a manga
i hope he isnt
reading that
i already found it like 15 mins ago
WHAT
PERSONA
it doesnt mention reddit
anywhere
i went to check on the persona okbc
to see if its there
yes it is
but i also found this
yes i know i already found it
this proves what he said yesterday was a lie
that he never goes on that subreddit and its not on his feed
incognito mode when looking up that cancer:
the alternative of not using reddit so nothing pops up on your feed because you have no feed:
yea i know
i stopped using reddit at all for being dogshit in like 2021
????????????????????????
WHY IS HITLER IN PERSONA 2
WHAT
who couldve seen that coming man i wonder
this is persona 2
this is what pixel loves so much
i wonder why man i wonder why
THIS ISNT REAL
Hitler started the World War to advance human evolution and studied the sorcery and mythology of the Mayans, and ordered searches in Mayan ancient ruins for the secret art of necromancy. He also did not commit suicide in 1945, but went into hiding in Antarctica with his last few supporters and created the Last Battalion, who will take over Xibalba and become a god by triggering a mass extinction event.
this sounds like something pixel would make
1999
is like for a day only
because stupid fucking nitro expires
tomorrow
he sent me the wheel now
whats more likely
pixel deciding to stop being completely insane
or pixel becoming the embodiement of misery
he can still help himself
thats just an excuse
its his own decision to be a schizo fucktard
not a real human being
help
dont read what he said in gc
thankfully i was too bothered with the heat to care
dude have you even read all this
.
that would require plane tickets out of egypu
"hi go help this miserable horny pumpkin"
he either kills himself or makes everyone else miserable
zelda
i think i need the therapist more
vc 10 seconds ago
"im emptying the backpacks"
"get on ark and do rexes ill empty the bexpex"
"did you just say bexpex"
i actually have terminal cancer
i think ill just do the first map (im like 95% done) and then take al ong break
my honest reaction: (severe brainrot but not nsfw)
the flochforster german ms paint skills
what
where
no i dint see it
i mean
compared to where i lived in us and here its completely inaccessible
and from the pics of bennys house i saw its also a wooden shack in the middle of nowhere
so theres zero way he got actual drugs
hes attention baiting
hello zeldalord
i convinced my french friend to say something
floch

imagine if theres multiple pixels
i was right!

maid adachi.
i stopped watching the moment he looked it up but i saw like at least 20 pictures
whyyy
im not taking """progessional""" advice from a schizophrenic
where
if i can ill get it ig
comedy
pixel was always schizo
you should transfer it to my steam if possible
is there any way to transfer it
when will it be on sale again
can you tell pixel to annoy me to buy it when its on sale a gain
ill buy it soon then ig
how much total pt
how much was
p4

if i look the entire name up i will get gigaspoiled for ark
i need just the first letter of his name
PIXEL WON
GG
THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME IVE BEEN MANIPULATED WITHOUT REALIZING AND SO FAST
i have genuinely become interested in persona and i cant get the songs out of my head
fuck pixel fuck pixel fuck pixel
oh my gofd its evrerwher
oh i forgot not everyone knows obscure ark shit
i mretarded
there is no escape
shibuya is a very important location in japan brainrot
it is true
i said "it is true" not "is it true"
illiterate miserable serbian waffle
why are the games as long as ark maps wtf
the next ark map is only like 80h
ark is peak the first map is jsut dogshit
ark lore is really good too
what does that mean zelda
i dont understand
oh
didnt piexl make you pla ythe 5th one?
does he know that
does he think you played it
i hope theres no watermelons in persona 5
how big of a role does adachi have
is that why pixel relates to him so much
LMA
who
its the cheapest one tho
whats the annoying character
not my fault
i cant be asked to
im too tired and miserable
of ark
anyway dont bring up the name
because useless silly is hellbent on finding who my accshare is
and will harass me and him and 500 other people
because hes useless and miserable
war
whar
the fuck is that???
what is that from
bro.
the melon gif
pixel most likely
why are you guys playing so late im like about to sleep
can we do it tmr at like any time but 4-6
or 9+
all the vegetable can do is goon
stupid
BRO
im listening to p3r ost on loop
im gonna kill ymself
whats the meaning
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
im listening to the persona songs for workout.
yes, even the one i hate.
its genuinely over zelda
it is genuinely fucking over
pixel has won
they have infected my premade youtube playlists i put on for workout
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
ive listened to them once before this btw
honestly sadly probably yes
i mean
i could also get subnautica
which isnt pixel rot
NO SPOILERS
i asked my accshare what a reaper is he has a message for you
thank god
do i get sub zero after playing entirety of subnautica
first subnautica
i havent
i just know theres a sea emperor leviathan thats all i know about the game
i have very bad memory zelda
how do you not know that
oh guess what the song you hated so much is on rn!
the hardstyle one
i do not shit myself once i see floppa in five nights at floppa
LMAO
i shit myself when doing ocean shit in ark
i really hope theres no mosasaur in subnautica
you dont know of the ocean cave incident zelda
it almost ended the entire ark playthrough
subnautica below zero
probably better than p3r.
so my entre life (schizphrenia)
subnautica im doing with multiplayer mod
the buggy af one
give me 30 mins
cant write shit im working out
i only yap in 1m 30 breaks
ok first subnautica
then probably undertale
and then subnautica below zero and terraria
and p3r in 6053 years
ive seen people
play terraria for like 3k hours
jesus.
yes
still
why does pixel not have all oneshot achievements
should i get oneshot fading memory
ik
its so he gets me hooked into the franchise
is there an adachi romance route
sorry i got 3 of these in a row
and its making me slowly insane
but is the game THAT shit that even pixel hates it
"admiration"
"ADMIRATION"
do you really think
its as simple as a slight admiration?
do you think pixel has installed any mods for that
there is one.
it exists.
i wonder what happened if i sent it to pixel
Adachi Romance Mod
Mod for Persona 4 Golden (PC)
wouldnt it be horrible if pixel found this
dont click on it
i didnt either i just copied link
oh i clicked on it
want to see something?
zelda what do you think would happen if i dm this link to pixel
WHAT
I JUST GOOGLED ADACHI ROMANCE ROUTE
IT WAS THE FIRST RESULT
pixels dad or smt idk
FIRST

im ark lore addict not persona addict
Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.
The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.
The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.
ik
i never went on oneshot reddit
because its furries and pedophiles
this is Robert
when is judgement day again
WHAT
THIS IS HOW WW3 STARTS
MISERABLE EGYPTIAN PUMPKIN FINDS A GAY SEX MOD IN A JAPANESE ROLE PLAYING GAME
its a lead up to sex then it skips through the sex to the next morning
i did core workout with the persona song i hate
WHAT
no it started playing
and i do core workout on my bed so i couldnt turn it off
??
PIXEL TOLD ME TO PLAY P4
YOU WERE LITERALLY RIGHT
i know
hes spamming me with it everywhere
ok but its literally grooming just not in the sexual question
hes slowly grooming me into becoming a personatard like he is bro
pixel IS grooming me
can you tell pixel i sent you graphic gay black porn so he gets scared and leaves me alone (i threatened him that ill send him that if he doesnt stop)
is he also spamming you japa nright now
and "adachi dancing"
ok pixel cant be stopped
nothing works
should i just accept my fate
nah id win
what a naive retard
fucking monkey
nah id win
i blocked him
did that work for you
you should just like
not listen to people
all the time
it will
i can turn off f adds
what do you mean
did you mean the bot
that i can also block
what then
this is discord
pixel cant do shit
how so
i blocked him
yes i blocked the bot
name one thing he can do
ill get bd and enable removeblockedusers
so it doesnt fill my chat
to become pixel 2
he wants you to play it eventually
and he still tortures you with other shit 24/7
pixel is more of a fucking virus than a person
does he have nothing better to do than this
are all egyptians so miserable
i am going to assassinate pixel
and the assassin is my friend who has way too much gay gifs saved
it will definitely break pixel
gay black porn will break him
i just dont want to send it myself
the operation begins
(he knows who pixel is ive shown him some of the brainrot before)
that would be funny
is pixel sane enough
that if he sees really fucked up shit he would go "nah its not worth it anymore ill get a new target"
or would he keep pursuing me
no hes playing fucking skyblock
also if this rollback didnt work teh ark playthrough is gone and i have to do 450 hours again
no
oh ok it worked
that was quite scary
nah id win
hes too busy playing FUCKING SKYBLOCK
im ending it
and with that i mean im spamming pixel gay porn
myself
well the start is great.
lets see if it worked
i sent him over 30 gifs of black gay porn
DOMAIN EXPANSION: THE VILEST SHIT ON THE INTERNET
i deployed my ultimate weapon zelda
The Spider.
we are having an intense fight right now
im using all my main weapons
the worst things i have
things that would make normal people vomit at the sight of them
im losing
he is completely unfased by things like ||humanoid spiders sucking dicks||
dont open the psoiler btw
i will win
i have a collection of gifs each one representing a lethal company monster
ZELDA
I LOST
im still going
ok im 99% sure
that he has images off
because theres no way hes unfased by this and doesnt react
ITS JUST NSFW
AND ADACHI BRAINROT
about hwat
show ss
what things did he mention
did he name anythung
idt he has images on
hes probably lying
tell him to name one thing
i dont wanna waste my time if he doesnt see it
zelda.
im 100% sure he doesnt look at the images
make him confirm he saw shit
make him tell you what kind of shit i sent  him
DID I WIN???
all it took was a video of ||electric cock and ball torture||
dw so did i
i lost my will to live googling "adachi porn" to send it to him
yes
idc about seeing adachi porn i just dotn wanna be botherded by pixel
cuz he annoying af
HOW IS THAT NOT ENOUGH
ill send him
the worst things i can find
ill send him fucking gore if thats what it takes
ill send him shit that makes me sick to look at
how
WHAT DOES HE FUCKING WANT
I DONT FUCKING HAVE ILLEGAL SHIT
what did you see
show
WHAT
do i just go to sleep
or do i also go insane and send him like 5 folders of gay porn
when is he back i want entertainment
what
explain
im going to fucking kill mysel
the right side of my headphones stopped working
over for pc
im going to main brawl stars
hello zelda
the final boss of ark is tomorrow
if i can do this i am free
im sorry what
one is me
the lowercase one
so hed accept the friend add
his cock becomes rock hard when he sees anything adach irelated
am i wrong.
what is round 2
how are you even sure it will happen
can it happen rn
im bored
nothing will really drive me insane
unless pixel has cp it will be fine
zelda i have gay porn and gore in my gifs
if you have not noticed yet most of my reactions were very overexaggreted
i mostly hate pixel because hes annoying not because hes schizo
oh is it maid adachi!??!?
i ltierally sent adachi porn to pixel idc
give me a slight hint
how are you sure
only ONE thing can drive me insane
and im not saying what it is
because pixel will weaponize it
im only vulnerable to one singular thing and pixel isnt aware of it
if i act gay and weird in gc
its to fuck with pixel
zelda
why are you posting that in quotes
i just explained to you
why i said that
pixel ruined it for me
i got interested in it then pixel ruined it for me again
4 words: hardcore gay black pornography
it breaks everyone but it didnt work on pixel
give me a brainrot preview
please
im so bored
LMAO
oh my fucking god
i want round 2 tho
funny!
how long ago
ok this message you cannot send to pixel at any cost
oh youd defo know if they did
should be fine hten
no.
NO
PLEASE NO
NO
NO
NO
if its what i think it is zelda
then this is where pixel wins
and i buy the entire persona franchise
just so it would stop
zelda
why did you have to tell him about it
you were typing what
anyway
is it ||the fucking table||
oh.
oh.
ph
oh.
oh.
oh.
oh.
oh.
yean o ill ignore it
yes but im not buying shit
my headset broke i cant buy a fucking adachi game and i dont want to
which
WHY THE TABLE
WHY THE FUCKING TABLE
okbc fine but WHY THE TABLE
the misery
whats your fucking grammar
idfk
honestly i think it was fucking overhead press 💀
(i do it with 2)
2 dumbells
maybe sometime it hit my right headphone and i didnt even notice
because i blast music so loud
no
tinnitus but the sound is the adachi moos
THE FUCKING TABLE
ill just
be worse than pixel
trust me i can
i have ark brainrot
nevermind i dont
i have one single image
blissfully unaware that he will achieve nothing at all
i am way too fucking stubborn to fall for this
i know manipulation when i see it
i got genuinely interested in the games when i looked at them from an outside perspective but pixel ruined it once more
if i discovered rain world by myself i would probably get it and play it
but now never.
it has very interesting lore and everything
but it would always remind me of that fucking pumpkin monkey
yea ik
i might get p5 because one of my friends really likes it and said its one of the best games hes played
but p3r NEVER after this
the trailer he spammed everywhere:
p5 is also the game hes mentioned the least
yea
ill pretend its working and im being interested
so he stops being insan
ill pretend im in a bad financial s ituation
ill say i got subnautica and whatever other shit i buy gifted
lying:
i am not in a bad financial situation zelda i would just lie to pixel
ill say the pc money was saved up from 6 years or smt
anyway
my steam profile is private anyway
FUCK
ill just procrastinate
the lie will be truth i will play the 11 ark dlcs
i mean he kinda is
he wont
you know how i spent 450 hours on ark?
ive only played the first map.
theres 11 more zelda
and i already bought all the dlcs
thats just on this map iirc
its literally the "easiest" part of the game
you afk for 150 hours
why im crying is because its miserable since i have nothing to do and im bored
and my youtube feed is retarded because im not logged in and i cant log in because i lost access to my google account and cant make a new one because "this phone number has been used too many times" (it has been used once)
no other maps you get to do that braindead part while doing other important stuff
here its just placed at the end
how.
its to "confirm youre not a robot"
you cant skip it zelda
genius!
i need a new phone anyways
no id get a new number on it too
my google account is completely fucked
and i need one
ive had this pc without a google account for 2 months
no its on some email
i think
that i think got disabled for spam or something?
ive already tried
surely..
maybe i could manipulate him from this point onward
also how is he this stupid
why would brainrot and harassment make me buy the game
???
what was the mind process
ONE song in the ost is good
the entire playlis
no youll tell pixel
and hs gonna spam me with it
3rd one is mid kinda
2nd one isnt all that bad but pixel screaming the lyrics made me despise it
mid
u played p4 right
is adachis character similar to pixels personality
how funny
broke egyptian monkey cant play shit himself so he forces others to do it
relatable to pixel
when did you even play it
oh i missed that era then
i was gooning on ark 24/7
who tf
oh its someone i barely knew 2 years ago
adachi?
how much of the game was adachi in
?
i thought hed be like a minor character
what even makes people obsessed with adachi
you know what ill do to stop pixel
completely spoil myself on the gameplay and lore of the games so theres no point in playing
does magnus also play rain world
schizophrenia
i have my funny flying bug back im so happy
DONT LET PIXEL KNOW I HAVE MONEY
he said im making him hate adachi
this is just part of the process dont worry
im not brainrotted
.
the worse shit i say to pixel regarding adachi
the more hell hate adachi
it worked tho
he said he doesnt like adachi thst much anymoee
why are you spreading it
his brainrot
ok so basically for the next like week and a half or 2 weeks ill be on vacation
please dont fucking interact with this fucktarded monkey
UNDER WHAT IS THAT
just show
im going to kill myself
it is true tho ark is hell
LMAO
ark is like an abusive relationship for me
i mean the next map is 50-100h playtime and no ascension so no progress loss..
id still argue ark is better than skyblock
ive gotten wiped on so many accounts in skyblock
flochforster is like one of the last ones standing
miserablea utomod
shush im making pixel hate it
i also dmd pixel some interesting adachi images
nothing
no
ill prob do like
50% ark 50% other games from now on
starting with subnautica
yea
subnautica!
ill do 50% multiplayer (ark) and 50% singleplater
im playing on the carrot map bro i cant quit
its fucking egypt
theres fucking hieroglyphs u can find on the map
ok tbf i didnt know 4 messages would break him
add me back in like 3h i will need entertainment when i land
pixels schizophrenia is so funny
i do.
i will go to a pizzeria and joker will be making the pizza
WHAT
i hope my plane crashes
WHAT
also i ordered pizza to not encounter the persona cosplayer
they actually understood english
can you call pixel the hard r for me
its deserved
he fucking hates it
i want to cause as much misery to him as possible
@ZeldaLord
the melon gif is pinned in persona okbc
btw the third post
is just cropped porn of what looks to be a 15 year old
look at it yourself
its the second post
that shit is definitely NOT fucking legal
also have a baldachi
its today's posts stupid
idk
how do i turn it off
im gonna be pixel 2
i love adacher
HI ZELDA LOOK WHAT I FOUND
i went so far that pixel is dming me a rain world poem
the sub is just
horny as fuck for adachi
@ZeldaLord i saw the italian post
whar
im looking at okbp
im kinda addicted
2 hours of no ark is turning me into pixel 2
i will be normal again after vacation
cant buy it on vacation bro
cba to go into steam via phone
pixel can gift it if he wants it that much
im buying p4
not spending 40$ on smt ill play for 20 mins
and i want max torture
p4
anyone can just click the "join game" button in ark and all my dinos are named slurs and my ark tribe is named "tribe of hard r"
consequences of people you play ark with being edgy as fuck
i am on invisible
fr?
ok ill unprivate ig
90% of wjat i say is bait
to give pixel either false hope or make him hate adachi
hes not that fucking deranged
i do plan on buying all persona games at dome point to mentally torture pixel and tell him ill play them over and over
because its an actual good game if you ignore the 600 bugs it has
the best way to describe ark is a very beatiful gf that fucking hates you and abuses you
nah ill buy p4 instead
max torture
yes thats why
you will suffer in ark i will suffer in p4
i want to see you beat all 3 guardians on alpha
and do all achievements
can be done in 200h, it took me 500h cuz i didnt breed rexes while doing other shit but after and i spent like 200h on just goofing around earlygMe
also noone plays ark on base settings
ill send u mine
fym ill play p4 for 200 hours
i will finish p4 and you will finish ark
which one is p4
yes same time for ark!
you will with ark if you dont have much patience
also have fun getting like 50k metal for rex saddles
metal is fucking cancer to get if solo!
is gameplay shit or character
ok new goal
beat at least one boss on alpha difficulty
one of them is quite easy to do with a certain strategy!
not that long
ill list 3 tasks that take like 50-150 hours depending on skill issue to do all 3 combined
- defeat alpha broodmother (was very easy with a certain strat)
- tame any giganotosaurus (i got one at like 60h pt)
- get all artifacts from caves but 2
theres 2 rly hard caves the snow cave and the hard ocean cave
finish persona 4
GG
10 ws tmr..
zeldalord jexjexkex stream in pj
you will love escaping many near death encounters then dying to a bug
and have fun recovering ur shit sometimes it spawns below the map itself
whart
ur not gonna suffer much
u wont have to do mutations
never fucking relax always be locked the fuck in
the moment you let your guard off you are GON
rly fun actually
but depends on your patience quite a bit
will you be able to stand taming a dino for a while, something just kills it and you have to get a nrw one
also you have to do all caves but two
1 is very hard solo but also really really fun
the other one is pretty lame and very bullshit
im very sorry but i need to ruin adachi for him
how do i then
what does pixel hate most
which
nah
my only true weakness is rain world
because it actually looks like a really good game
im only playing p4 so you play ark
ive seen worse than a shitty game
what i sent pixel is the tip of the iceberg
is any of the persona games an actual good game
is adachi unserious shit
also play p5 after ark
fr????
hes not?????
ok stop spoiling
i wanna experience this shit myself
is p4 not 2020
whats the newest version of p4
also is adachi canonically older than magnus
no the existence of sdschi
also why do u think i care about the game being from 2012
ark is from 2015 and has 6939 bugs
i love torturing myself
im a masochist like adacher
i love adachi
temporary
crazy?
i was crazy once
they put me in a room
a hotel room
a hotel room without ark
and the abscence of ark made me crazy.
DJD YOU????
OMG
GG PLAY IT
finish rw and pixeld bs
snd whrn im bsck from vsvation i stsrt p4g
rw, uty, p5
im back in like a week then u start ark and i start p4g
OK HOW IS IT THAT FUCKING BAD
ur not telling me p4g is worse than 50 megalodons and 3 mosas aswell as an alpha tuso gangraping your basilos and rhyniognatha and making you lose all items
i love hard ocean cave
if i really hate p4g ill make u do hard ocean cave
ill leave the surprise of it to you
temporary
no ark is making me miserable and insane
idc abt the price diff
i want to play the game with adachi
name?
anyway if its really that bad
p3r or p5r if not p4g
would you ever replay p4
if you dont have much patience
you will utterly despise ark
and want to break your pc
you need to be like calm and patient
or you will ragequit ark day 1
i am neither i got mad so many times i just still play it due to addiction
WHAT
PIXELATED FACE
try to start ark
tame your first pteranodon
ark!!!
u get used to it a bit
a week or less
like what
GG
UR GONNA HAVE FUN
uty ig?
oh
but really just start ark rn cuz first few days u just gotta get used to the game before u make much progress
also if it wasnt obvious enough, you are playing the map called "The Island" under story maps
hf in the redwoods
i want u to ss when u go there first time
a chain of unrelated events and conditions at the wrong time can lead to anything
i will play p4g and after that more singleplayer shit
pixel is lucky that he wins due to coincidences
by the time you play ark i will already quit it
better than ark
also adachi!
trust me its going to be way better than ark
finish it then play ark
people have done it in like 15h or less
do you think
i can do p4g on a shitty laptop
trust me you wont
main reason i finished ark was because i get addicted to shit too easily
im probably insane enough
to enjoy p4g
i am not buying another persona game just to play adachi game after
i want to see adacher, zelda
the image is not loading jewlord
obv no retard
i wanna play the adachi game to induce the maximum torture upon myself
divine punishment for playing ark
and the skyblock incident
is that the 9th circle of hell
ig thats what ill do for vacation
REGIAN???????
its temporary because ill do subnautica or solo ark after it
zelda wouldnt it be funny if
i went to a store near the hotel
and bought some cabbages
i almost
sent a fucking face pic
instead of adacher cabbage
im gonna kill myself
mobile discord is flawless
zelda you know whats funny
out of any fate awaiting me after this vacation
pixel winning is probably the least bad one
1 200h brainrot game is better than being consumed back into the worst parts of skyblock community while being an ark main
if i played p4 i would get into more singleplayer shit and free myself
ill be free at least
no the outcomes i meant are post vacation not post p4
its either
its only one thing zelda
subnautica
im never playing a second persona game
ark maybe either solo or pvp
but never duo multiplayer again.
the main objective is cutting off the skyblock community entirely
thats the bad part not ark
solo ark a few times a week when bored of only playing one game isnt that bsd
whats bad is 14h ark sessions
ark would be singleplayer ark, zelda
i do not wish to be Mizerabel
and i meant to do terraria too
wow mobile discord deletes messages so fast!
anyway terraria then undertale then probably elden ring
the horrors of the skyblock community
zelda, when i quit hypixel skyblock and started maining ark i escaped the game
not the community
bro 90% of my camera roll is adachi (i bought new phone before vacation)
buy me p4 im broke
i live in sand pyramid gift me p4
GG
how does this change the breaking bad timeline?
how would that make you free
i am pixel 2
persona 1 and 2 exist, no?
i made a reddit account for this
nah its just to show neand
that its not fucking funny
a chain of badly timed events led up to this it isnt my fault
yes its temporary
its an escape from skyblock hell
how lmao
i starteD this TODAY
you need to buy me p4g
all i have is 10 grams of sand
PEXel????
find me one
whos the annoying character btw
ok
also whos the annoying character
?
phone vcs are stage 4 terminal cancer
...
what the fuck is this referring to
please tell me this is some made up shit and not the actual storyline
please tell me this is some made up shit and not the actual storyline

im overcoming my fears to become pixel 2.0
just imagine i sent you the image of adachi looking insane with the caption "TESTICULAR!"
images dont send for some reason
nahhh
"if he asks about p5 tell him to play rw"
u should tho
go play rw rn
"I want sae to crush my dick and balls like a hydraulic compressor"
i love this subreddit
play rw!
play ark the moment im back
u have to finish the game the area is short
hey zelda
zrlda
u here?
the link doesnt copy!
one will be slightly annoying one will turn you into pixel 3
we should play ark together
i need to redo the first map anyways
because the incident
its literally his plan to make you play rw
by bothering you with p5
he said you need to finish the gsme
LMAO
did u finish the game
finish the entire game
ur not opening p5 until ark is done buddy
no
nothing saves you from ark lmao
do rw until im bsck
then ark
if you think theres an escape from ark just face your unfortunate reality
p4 will be fun
and ill be doing half p4 half subnautica anyway
ark the moment im back
oh yea zelda
bsse ark settings have cancer
ill send you mine
LMFAO
IS THAT REAL
anyway
ill delay ark by a week if you buy p4g
ok p3r
i said i wouldve
you already hsd it
also isnt p3g like 20 dollars or something
p4g is 20
i mean p3g
huh does it not exist
i thought it would
surely thats not a lie
use an actual
coinflip site
not what pixel sends you
did you use that
and somehow get it each time..
i thought pixel sent u some rigged shit
send it
retard
why? is it stupid
yes
record it please
i wanna see the retardation
im gonna go back to miserably playing ark
funniest to experience it yourself
specs?
of the laptoo
p

the same friend also has 5000 hours in hypixel skyblock
at 23 years old
mute dms with pixel until morning
omg antivillain main protag????
thats so cool and edgy and sigma
#broken #nooneunderstandsme
also
when you play ark
will you be interested in the lore?
you dont get to experience the main lore until the 4th map with just some subtle hints for it on the first and third
even i dont know much im just working with what i have from the first map
but the prologue of second map literally confirmed my theories for a character and the third map
yeah it is
also
the area right before the final boss
has lore regarding the 4th map and the main lore of the game
BUT I COULDNT SEE SHIT BECAUSE A FRENCH 15 YEAR OLD WAS YELLING AT ME TO START THE BOSS
zelda do you wanna know the main source of lore i have?
NO WTF THATS SPOILERS
Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.
The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.
The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.
its this text from an ingame "explorer note" from author "???"
this text is about the 4th map
zelda, have you read it?
what do you think about it?

and the front page of the auction house is already filled with swastikas
who could have EVER seen this coming???
ok but it relates to you
you are miserable, zelda

preferrably something that isnt ark and something that pixel never mentioned
just give some suggestiond
amorgus

im so bored
ive been awake for 6h 30 and havent been on ark yet

@ZeldaLord
i am using pfps out of these 40
and pixel is saying sexual shit about every pfp
he is sexually talking about CATS
look in gc
can it wait im running rn
what did pixel do now
PERSONA UP TO 70%
JRICBEJSODBBR
were buying pixel the gift rn if p3r is giga off
well we can schedule it
whats p4 at
p4 12$.
im getting that.
im gonna research if its in any way possible for him to run it
if its not im buying it unless elden ring goes on 66% sale (it wont)
does he actually not have a gpu
how much is p5
ok i might get that for myself
66% off is insane
golden like persona 4 golden
nah id buy
its not even pixel making me want to buy it because his brainrot is mainly p3 and p4
its the subreddit
i wonder if in 10 years when pixel escapes egypt and gets a gpu if he will play p3r
why is egypt like limbo
which game is pixels favorit
do i buy p5 and never play it to taunt him
is it worth the 24$
id never play it tho
has to be bait..
do they even have a 1650 in egypy
in its 73 years old but do they.
😭
how much
what vpn do i get
i do
reasons not related to subnautica multiplayer
and with that i mean hosting a orespawn server
others can see my ip if they join so like
i need vpn
it will be with 1 person but
i dont want anyone to see myi p
i dont want anyone even knowing what city i live in
im using the essential thing
just what vpn do i get
which one do you use
oh
does pixel?
did i ever mention what vpn i used before like june
i unsubscribed for pc funds and forgot what i was using
if i join a server my ip is visible
do you think a 15 year old retard could find it
no hes like smart with tech shit
he was one of the people i ruthlessly tormented for tech support
curiousity or smt idfk
IM A PARANOID PERSON OK
i will get a baguette mailed to my german shack
he can find like the village around it and shit
there is precisely one massive wooden shack in that area
check how often sales happen
WHY IS THERE PARTIAL NUDITY IN PERSONA 5
actually idm if its her
gooning to persona
zelda imagine
benny melk on r34 as always
and stumbles upon rise
anyway fun fact benny melk goons to femboys probably
yes thats the banned one
"i hate gay people faggot faggot faggot" he hates himself
like literally
he also hates austria
"femboys are pretty hot i just have to imagine they have vaginas" - benny melk somewhere in ohd or boarpire
also he had a child ralsei pfp for 6 months
yes
wait no
thats not me actually
nah ik that image doesnt have me in it
its the gwen person
aka jungle
i was obsessed with carrot not ben
the image shows gwen being obsessed with ben and ben being obsessed with carrot
misery
zeldalord will be pixel 2
isnt it like 100h total..
oh yea is rw good
im getting it next sale
bro this retard
keeps yapping about soggy cat being ugly and that it should kill itself
french people amirite
itd probably open and crash during the opening cutscene
and his egypt sandstone house would explode
do you seriously think i didnt buy them all yet
i cant run it
i buy it you give me 20 dollar steam card
pixel goes insane
but we dont tell him until his birthday
its gonna be a surprise until it happens
thanks steam recommendations!
zelda my steam library is public
im not a gooner like ben
where can i show those
who is rainbuu and what is changed
zelda
before you said that
i checked the traielr on the steam page
WHAT THE FUCK????????????????????????????????????????????
its cropped pixelated furries fucking from the steam trailer for """""""""changed"""""""""
tldr: no
zelda you seem to know more
what exactly is this game about?
who
i probably remember then
is it ultranine by any chance
YEP
LFAMO
💀
im buying it
what could ever possibly happen
really cheap
are you discriminating?
i finally obtained a vpn
literally the first one that came up in "Sponsored" things when i googled vpn
im sleep deprived dont expect me to put thought into shit
yea
i dont care enough
ill go sleep rn ig
whats the point where i can still sleep
without ruining sleep schedue
subnauticock multiplayer mod has cancer
i literally wasted money this bullshit doxxed my ip
the subnautica mod shows public ip too!
a retarded french 15 year old now has my ip
and i want to kill myself
life is misery
i am burning down the wooden shack and becoming homeless in the city
not awake
10 seconds ago zelda
nrn
ill prob be busy today
ok finally
i found smt that hosts the server for 5$ a month
so my ip doesnt get raped
no zelda, vpn worked
the mod just ignores it because the server is being hosted on my pc
so it shows that ip
yes
it doesnt fucking work in this one specific scenario
kms
im doing the next ones solo
..
?
??????????
the fuck is that supposed to mean??????????????
zeldalord
you have done something that never shouldve been done
and you will see consequences
you are well aware of what you have done
WHEN
do you really think i will now
???
?
what do yu mean zelda
OH
you are a nigger zeldalord
but im logging on
you are a black fucking nigger
ok fine ill stop adding him
but can we normallt resolve this
the french nigger zelda
who else
i alt tabbed for 3 seconds why did you kick me
do i look like i have cheats
or care enough to cheat
it was such an obvious joke
i need to bw today
i have nothing else to do
playing only terraria made me want to relapse intoa rk
add me back
you can dm miss silly if i "hard cheat"
nah im tryna get all modification station and cyclops fragments first
the dark desert area is scary
also some area with small hills has a warning "multiple leviathan lifeforms" AND THEN THERES A REAPER RIGHT THERE
also regarding aurora
i tried to visit it for scrap one time
floch
"""THE REAPER""" - Clipped with Medal.tv
26 Views. Watch """THE REAPER""" and millions of other Subnautica videos on Medal, the #1 Game Clip Platform.
will my seamoth get raped if i leave it there
theres a reaper at the front of the aurora at the mushroom forest border do you mean that one
isnt that behind it?
can my seamoth enter it btw
what should i bring to the aurora
propulsion cannon?
i need to make one
can i do that to the stupid fucking crabs
thank god
i can farm resources on that one island now
also i have a farm setup
how do i put shit in the aquarium
mountain
the alien island and the food island yea
how many total leviathans exist dont name them just say the number
yea
reefback
reaper
ghost
sea emperor (i got its name spoiled when mastersilly yapped about it)
are there any new leviathans in the shadow desert area and the shadow hill area
also should i be scared of bonesharks or can i explore areas with them
whats the biggest risk apart from reapers
just threaten him with that image and hell shut up
theyre paying him 16 cents
more than carrot
wait what the fuck how did i not see WHAT THE FUCK
?????????????????
WHAT THE FUCK
are you for real..
why is he sad for a character he knows nothing about
oh my god what the fuck
what the fuck happened
ITS BEEN LIKE A WEEK ZELDA WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED
IS THIS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I DONT PLAY ARK FOR 10 DAYS????
what the fuck
you dont just find a pedophile on bedwars what the fuck happened
oh my god
WHAT
ok im going to be completely honest im not surprised in the slightest
the main reason i completely got rid of okbp isnt because of the brainrot but because theyre all either pedophiles or larping as pedophiles
its creepy as fuck
i showed you some posts when i was in regianland
a big contributor to me leaving it is also you know that one time i saw a fucking SUICIDE NOTE in the subreddit
judging by past post history
didnt check in a while but for like 3d or more i think no
zelda
when you played p3
did you become depressed
do you have to be schizo to understand the story
ok i checked
nothing for 16 days then 1 day ago
pixels mental state
what song even
let me see how "tragic" it is
link? i cant find any with japanme se name
just send the link of it
it sounds very happy and cheerful
is he fucking retarded???
is he stupid
holy shit what the fuck made them all so sad
does a cute cat die or something
oh no a guy dies
why do people become depressed for years because of that
people remembering shit like this over a japan dude dying
are they stupid???
so
what makes the lyrics so miserable
what are they talking about
i dont have it
couldnt find anywhere
im blind.
i listened to it
im now emo and misunderstood
noone understands my pain and feelings
the world hurt me too horribly
nothing is good anymore
the world is broken and corrupted
ok but its just a sad song what the fuck makes it so depressing
like its nothing special tf
schizo
what
insanity

MAYBE id SLIGHTLY understand if he played the game for 200 hours and got attached to the characters
but this???
😭🙏
would he play p3p if i bought it
i love how a small amount of money can cause mental illness to people
me carrot pixel could play p3p at the same time and become severely mentally ill

how do i gift him to it atfer i purchase the key?
oh its that easy

its so all over the place
not my taste
give this to an adhd kid instead
zelda
the song
is shit
this sounds like something a 11 year old tiktok addict would listen to
i havent listened to that since you black people bullied me over it for 2 entire days
i only listen to real music now
BRO
REAL MUSIC IS **NOT** P DIDDY
I HAVENT LISTENED TO THAT IN SO LONG AND WONT EVER AGAIN BECAUSE YOU AND CARROT GAVE ME PTSD OVER IT
theres no playlist i let yt autoplay
most recent shit
(i use phone for music cuz my right headphone broke)
no
i completely managed to get rid of it from recommendations
hello are you blind mr zeldalord
here you go
zelda
i found adachi in the weirdest fucking way possible
i cant speak on it but its E V E R Y W H E R E
its permanently a part of my life now
what
idc enough to spend money
you know how it was always easy to get first ws and impossible to get 2nd?
carrot gets angry fast
but he got too fucking angry at the end
one of the ws i didnt throw tho
it was pixel making the oneshot bulb
while the guy broke the bed behind him
no we did!
pixel just gooned!
i saw trap go off and went to base and i see pixel is building a bulb
and bed was broken 2s after
building a oneshot bulb
can you not read zelda
WHTA
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
IM BLOCKING PIXEL
IM NOT RISKING IT
fucking better discord monkey
phone takes so long to delete
anyway zelda
do u think adachi has shaved  and soft thighs
no its gonna be freaksona
im scared
its 5am and im browsing okbp
and thats a 3 part gay sex fanfic between adachi and some dojima guy
?
ill do a online coinflip
as to who gets an adachidump in dms
you or pixel
heads you tails pixel
hi
let me know if pixel kills himself later tonight
huge chance he will
stubborn ahh mf
ive organised an entire adachi folder
ive already used it on "a" and he got close to killing himself
pixel should live in fear
no zelda
if you take someone elses joke and overuse it
it becomes unfunny
thats why im """obsessed""" with adachi
she had his head on her crotch
is he decapitated in the ending or no
what even is that
why is pixel dming me if i have an erection
????
this was the context
HELP
IM SCARED
zelda
pixel
has a problem with anime children
ok why
i mean is he wrong
also zelda i found something both funny and sad
i might uh have issues
carrot is gooning ok
ive been on ark for under 2 minutes zelda
its literally a matter of time until another wyvern makes me quit for 2 weeks again
what else would i play
SKYBLOCK!??!!?
ok
i will stop gooning on ark and do subnautica if you tell me what to do
ill send you what progress i have rn
just tell me next thing to do and ill do it by myself from there on
@ZeldaLord im no longer on ark!!!
what do i do next
i cant find modification station fragments anywhere

i was also in
"detecting multiple leviathan class lifeforms in the region"
whats that zeldalord?
what lives in there, zeldalord?
what do i need to go to the aurora
on the island?

my seamoth explodes when i go below 200m
I HAVENT BEEN AT THE AURORA
HOW DO I GET THERE

ok im going there!
isnt there always a reaper there though
do i wait for it to not be night
what should i set my gamma to
so its easier to see the reaper
im scared of reapers
enter here?
NO
I HEARD HIM
AND SAW HIM FROM AFAR
IM NOT DOING THIS
IM GOING TO WATCH YOUTUBE OR SOMETHING
IM NOT DOING THIS
zelda
apparently theres a seamoth module that shocks reapers that attack
how do i get it?
no
he SCREAMED AT ME
and started approaching me
he was very far tho
WAIT
CAN I USE A PROPULSION CANNON
ON REAPER
subnautica too scary
ill do terraria and ark
reaper scary
if he hits me and i go towards the aurora will he kill me and explode my seamoth
.
howwww
hes under here
i went really far away after this
because reaper scream
ok zelda
what are the biggest hazards to a seamoth
how many hits for reaper to destroy it
I FEEL LIKE EACH TIME I WANT TO EXPLORE AN INCH IN THIS GAME IM AT RISK OF MY SEAMOTH IMPLODING
life is misery
"architecthor" starts school tomorrow so no ark
which means i can only do subnautica
i want to end it all
can we do pjbw 24/7
im just gonna sleep at this point
someone is always gooning
dont tell carrot but
in those final 3s i was throwing on purpose to make him mad
we can cook in 3s with me on defense actually listening to you guys
if pixel goons
ok but
akechi looks like a gay schizo loser
adachi looks like the peak masculine man
is that canon
how is he a cuck
you act like i know what he means with that
no i mean the "white blindfold" thing
then i play p3p
give carrot 1 dollar for gamepass
so we can do p3p
zzz
why dors everyone stalk me
ive been online for 2 mjnutes and got 3 dms
do you think it ends with joker and akechi kissing/datibg
LMAO THE COPE
how did he die
why is pixel coping so hard
does he genuinely think he survived
its just gonna end up being "we never saw his corpse he might be alive"
nobara basically
what the fuck???
😭
😭
how is he a cuck btw
please explain i need a good laugh
????
elaborate
what the fuck
how is
akechi

Hi!
what i wasnt even posting an image
i was just about to say that they ship joker and akechi
wbat the fick did he xo
pixel
sent me a spoilered image
WHAT THE FUCK
WHY IS IT NOT SPOILERED
WHY DID I HSVE TO SEE THIS
WHY DOES HE HAVE THIS
is he sure he didnt mix up gay porn he was watching with the game
"free" my ass
p3p whenever carrot gets 10 dollars off modrinth
and with his 15 cent rates, that means youre free for a while!
so
is what is akechis fate
persona 5 ends with adachi buying everyone cabbages
what
What
pixel would call anything well written
hes #1 persona fanboy
is it like a fun game
will i laugh at the schizoness
is it more schizo or is it more cringe
does it have schizoland like persona 4
does p3p also have schizoland
does persona 3
have schizoland
what schizoland is most schizo

FEIN

so what would you rate it as
.
maybe
its what caused akechi to survive?
so i should buy p4?
i want a miserable game
which game's schizoland is best
hello zelda
what the fuck
OH MY FUCKING GOD IT KEEPS DOING IT
I CANT LISTEN TO KIMI NO KIOKU BECAUSE INCOGNITO WANTS ME TO SIGN IN BUT IF I SIGN IN ILL GET PERSONA RECOMMENDATIONS
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ark if it wasnt dogshit
ark if it wasnt fucking horrible
its a rex
ITS 1.7.10 OK
WTF
1.7.10 HAS A BRIGHTNESS OPTION
oh my god look its a triceratops
alosaurus!
i am sinning.
ight im done now
this was a very miserable 14 minutes ngl
also i saw this when i was playing..
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
log on hypixel for 3 minutes
log on, zeldalord!
idk
carrot cares way too much
i cant help myself not ragebait carrot
"pedophiles"
in this case architecthor is the pedophile because he found the image and sent it to me
and he is 15
while i am 16
and carrot the one who got it sent to is 19
no fucking shit
although its severely fucked up sending something for shock value to disgust another person isnt the same as actually being into it
im not saying what i was doing isnt wrong im just saying im not a fucking pedophile
by this logic architecthor is a pedophile because he sent a lot of """art""" for """comedy""" purposes
(we are just retarded 15 and 16 year olds)
yes
why is he posting akechi
funnily enough i dont even think so
i did a lot of kuudra but i quit before he started playing much
maybe idk
ok what was wrong with it
what was so wrong with it.
why
what video did you watch
@ZeldaLord i am expecting a link you are not just dissing ark like this
locked in for what
who the fuck streams ark
was it a pvp server zelda?
so wha tdid you see?
please elaborate as much as possible
i WILL make you love ark
its hard to like sometimes but its fine
so @ZeldaLord what did you see?
why r u playing 3s with rndoms
thats miserable asf
anyway was the ark PVP or PVE
still miserable
just answer this short questio
readd me when shibuya arc starts
idrc about season 1 it doesnt have much peak
of what
oh good
s2 e22 has a certain scene that will make you hang yourself
its the most disgusting thing ive seen in manga
or anime
its far worse than attack on titans necro kiss
no..
its far worse than that
anyway add me for season 2 episode 7
thats where the peak starts
no
hes probably trolling you
s2 e22 left everyone mentally scarred
just skip the one scene
the rest of the episode is PEAK
so are you done with bedwars
please elaborate on ark
?
??????????
??????????
also when s2 e7 watchparty
i need to be there
eh the megumi scene in s1 is kinda mid
did pixel spread the virus
of akechi
ok thats not gay?
i love gojo too and im not gay
im looking at persona videos supposed to get you in the series without spoilers
do i kill myself?
i cant decide if i should get p3r or p5
p3r is extremely expensive but looks better
and p5 is schizo and cheaper
THEY MENTIONED WALMART
ok final deciding factor
which game has the least annoying side characters (yes i mean teddie with this)
p5r?
does he look silly
he looks ugly and fucking stupid
whats the best storyline and character development
p3r or p5r
P3R HAS THIS??????????
HOLY SHIT SHE ACTUALLY ISNT A MINOR LETS GO
anyway
p3r looks like an actual good game with a good cast and story
p4 looks like a comedic relief shitfest
and p5 looks like fun schizophrenia
im 16
i am this far into the video and its very evident
OMG
when i play persona 4 (prob next year sadly) im gonna max out adachis social link
me and adachi are gonna be besties forever <3333
i swear to fucking god if adachi dies or something
if hes one of those "tv victims" ill kill the creator of the game
i feel like this is a lie
also
p5 has akechi p4 has adachi what does p3 have like that
:(
what about just a detective
OMG ADACHER ALIVE
why is p5 kasumi a downgrade from p3 mitsuri
does his name start with a and end with i
kasumi looks like mitsuri but worse
looks STUPID looks GOOD
is p3r story better than p5r
i cant fucking believe pixel is gooning to that cop hoe when mitsuri exists
does it have good character development
and an actual interesting cast (p4 cats makes me want to kms)
i just did something productive zelda
i worked out ran showered
now im going to play orespawn
surely you mean p4 RIGHT
is there any annoying characters
in p3
is there any stupid looking characters like jack frost teddie and that one cat
huhh?
how do you avoid him
which game has coolest pissowner designs
wow i thought the gameplay of persona was just going to dungeons and killing shit with your personas
the concept of the games looks so fun
i need to get one of the games asap
why does it look like that
it releaed in **2012**
isnt p5r 2019?
i mean the graphics look pretty good
but p3r has the best imo
persona is literally ark omg
(every ark thing gets delayed)
wait so personas are literally stands but more schizophrenic
when is persona 6
a fucking logo or something
persona fans are insane
GG
GG
G
GG
GG
is persona another one of those games
where you should completely isolate yourself from the fandom
i went on okbp for like an hour recently
im convinced these people are actually pedophiles
its actually so fucked up
wanna know what theres a massive community for?
shipping joker and akechi
WAIT MITSURI ISNT IN P3R??????????????????????????????????????????
which
aigis?
ohhh the woman that got added for feminism reasons?
yukari???
shes one of the main characters no???
how long you think until p3r is same price as p5r
like 38
ye i cba to wait then
ill prob do p3r then p4 then p5
is there any continuation?
and does anyone play p1 and p2
OH THAT SHIT
why is that
in p2
"The team fighting Hitler with Personas."
his name is changed to Fuhrer with sunglasses in some other release
In the PSP remake, Hitler receives a mild censorship. His name is replaced by "Fuhrer," and he wears black sunglasses to cover his eyes.
The infamous German dictator that took power in 1933 and the mastermind of World War II. According to Mrs. Ideal, Hitler started the World War to advance human evolution and studied the sorcery and mythology of the Mayans, and ordered searches in Mayan ancient ruins for the secret art of necromancy. He also did not commit suicide in 1945, but went into hiding in Antarctica with his last few supporters and created the Last Battalion, who will take over Xibalba and become a god by triggering a mass extinction event.
WHO COOKED THIS
WHO FUCKING THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA
IS THAT THE ONLY ISSUE YOU HAVE WITH IT???
i see why noone mentions p2 now
the final boss is probably stalin or something
considering there is an adachi sex mod
do you think theres a mod that removes teddie?
thats actually sick character design
looks like something outta csm
what game has the best ost
i like p5r but p3r is better
also does the frog noise song play in the game?
what the fuck is acid jazz
yess
what style is p3r
idk what genre it really is
i kinda like that one
oh cool ive been awake for over 24h again
fuckimg miserable
WAIT THERES FUCKING ROMANCE OPTIONS IN PERSONA
IM MAXING MITSURUS SOCIAL LINK
how does skill issue affect hearing a song.
and when does the game end?
so do i just drop every other social link im doing to do mitsuru
the video im watching is saying its very hard to max all of them without a guide
can you not romance anyone all the p4 girls fucking suck
HEY ZELDA
WHY CAN YOU ROMANCE A GROWN ASS WOMAN IN P5
ISNT THE PROTAGONIST LIKE 15???
HWAT THE FUCK
WHY DID THEY ADD THAT???
makoto is probably the best option for p5
ZELDA
THEY ADDED SOMETHING
ALONGSIDE IT
WHY THE FUCK AM I SEEING THIS ON THE WIKI
WHAT THE FUCK
why can your homeroom teacher wear a maid dress and you can also romance her
is this another case of barely disguised fetish
oh so persona 5 goes for realism
underpaid teacher needs to be a whore but she cant really be a whore
because its like pg13
is his name carrot
how is a maid dress useful, zelda?
what then
romancing a 30 year old as a 16 year old?
ohh
LMAO WHY IS RISE A ROMANCE OPTION IN P4
im going through persona 4 romance options
THIS IS A FUCKING CHILD????????????????????
THIS IS A FUCKING MAN?????????????????????
this looks like femboy makoto
can you romance noone
yukiko is the only acceptable option but mehh
who did you choose for all 3 games
who in p4
im gonna do mitsuru yukiko makoto
WHAT
WHO
he looks like yuta from jjk
also is there any p6 release date
i wanna finish all 3 games before p6 releases
what game
isnt persona their best franchise
why have they not released a new game since 2016
persona 4 was 2008
persona 5 was 2016
why is persona 6 not 2024
wait persona 3 was only 2 years before persona 4???
and persona 1 is 1996 and persona 2 1999
do they plan on making a p4 remake
isnt p4 worse than p3 tho
and less popular
although reddit schizos say persona 4 has best characters (no)
probably just for adachi memes
new adachi model would break the internet
also how
its been out for like half a year
isnt persona 5 extremely popular
is it total sales or speed of sales
oh ok
GGGG
oh yea why is there a p4 rhythm game
WHY IS THE FACE MISSING LMFAO
also do the games have any dlcs that have more content than the base game
(yes im referring to ark)
you have ark which is like 500h then a 250h dlc then another 250h dlc then a 500h dlc and 2 more 500h dlcs
then theres the 6 non canon dlcs which im pretty sure are all far longer to complete than any of these
p3r has a dlc right
the one after makoto dies
thats gonna be fun
how much is it?
steam key?
i cant find any listings
anyway is buying keys simple
do i pay, get key, put into steam and thats it?
i mean if p3r is 70$ on steam 38$ isnt that bad
ill take it
p3r is gonna be a massive challenge because ill be playing with one hand
are they releasing a p5 remake any time soon
i love how p3r looks like
i wish p5 did too
p4 is genuinely gonna be so miserable
its 12 fucking years old
everything prob outdated af
looks dogshit
dogshit characters
at least adachi is there
is adachi well written btw
is he actually an incel
i want adachi to be the one likeable character from p4
are all characters as annoying ingame as in the anime
also you are literaly the p4 protag
looks fucking miserable and has silver hair (pixel said you have gray hair)
also
what is "the fog" from p4
i saw it mentioed on okbp too a bit
i still remember when pixel dmd me like a month ago that the fog is ||adachis farts||
so like the deadlines for palaces in p5?
huh
zelda the game came out in 2024 didnt you play it years ago?
p3r
didnt some canada guy force you to play it months ago
so when did you do p4
is all youve been playing this year
persona
how unenjoyable was p4
also rate all persona games out of 10
HOW DID YOU DO 220 HOURS IN LIKE 2 WEEKS???
zelda.
thats more than i played ark for each day.
way more.
also why does jonkler look like a twink when not in his outfit
he looks like a weak nerd
aka he looks STUPID
and makoto just looks like an outcast emo
ZELDA
ZELDA
ZELDA
ZELDA
ZELDA
ZELDA
why is everyone obsessed with akechi
he looks like a schizo gay loser
do they relate to him?
i wouldnt be surprised considering its persona fans
the WHAT
also why do most people have like 90h
and you had 200h+
i fucking wonder why
anyway what the fuck is that
WAIT
I REMEMBER
I REMEMBER NOW
why does p3r trailer have the frog noise song
oh p3r has a cute dog
THIS LITTLE NIGGER I SWEAR TO GOD
I HAVE NO FUCKING PATIENCE FOR THIS FUCKING THING
I HATE HIM
I HOPE HE FUCKING DIES
CAN I COMPLETELY AVOID HIM
why is he in the trailer
ohh yea
i remember now
we looked into it when pixel posted an out of context meme of him
anyway i see the appeal of pissowner now
im gonna play all the games at some point
starting with p3r
kill yourself????????????
how much did pixel pay you
is that why hes broke
do a p5 one
"Why so serious?"
what does "burn the bear" mean
from what ive seen
teddie is worse than rise
i saw a meme of that on okbp
some god: i will release some lust thing
rise: uwu uwu senpai something idfk and idgaf
some god: i havent even released it yet
ALL OF THEM ARE SHIT
what is this referring to
also FEIN?
who is "nanako"
THATS FUCKED UP
?????????
this is the only adachi comment i found
it seems adachi isnt really a big part of the game sadly
WAOIT WAT
??!?!?!
????????????????????
WHAT THE UFKC

why do kimi no kioku lyrics have to be so sad
im experiencing the exact thing carrot was
i am getting sad for characters i dont know shit about
theres a reaper at the edge no?
that reaper is the reason im afraid to play the game
the alien base that i was scared like shit every second there because one of my friends baited me that theres a massive alien octopus around the island area
i dont think its about mental weakness anymore even
its just a really sad fucking song
no
not warpers
he admitted he was joking
zelda
ive told you already
yea
thats when i listened to the p3r one
without any lyrics
no
first some random thing then the p3r without lyrics
there wasnt an alien octopus, zeldalord
i got baited

did they get damaged in a sandstorm
p4 protag is around 180
you would be perfect for that cosplay
do you have a similar haircut to the p4 protag
the sand was always there rubbing on his eyes..
who should carrot cosplay in the kosovo meetup
magnus can probably cosplay a woman since hes short
why

what did he stumble upon
oh yea theres a massive joker x akechi community
what i never told u guys is read one of the fanfics and its so disgusting
further elaboration wont happen
can you pass on a mesasge to pixel?
akechi seems like the submissive one come on LOOK AT HIM
whatever he says
im gonna go through all r34 joker x akechi posts and make a percentage of who is the dominant and submissive one
i will actually
dw
nah
hes bluffing
he didnt actually read it lmao
nothing ;)

this
is what i meant to send
what the fuck
how can i
mentally hurt pixel
without sending illegal shit
i want to fucking make him miserable and depressed
hes extremely hard to manipulate
what is his weak point zelda
you talk to him the most
im not at rockbottom YET but i will be soon
anyway zelda
what new personality would annoy pixel the most
do i act like an annoying white girl?
what then
i feel like hes not suffering enough
he barely reacts
i feel like he enjoys the fucking ragebait i post which is
concerning
no zelda he does not
he doesnt care he enjoys his persona brainrot

p3p ending?
hell play it when p3 rereleases 4 more times
curse of modrinth
isnt it like a good game
i heard a lot of people say it is
isnt p3p shit tho
and p3r acc good
or was og p3 the shit one
why is kimi no kioku actually one of the best things ever made
they did not need to cook so hard for a schizo game
please tell me you are not also joking about p4 in the same way
thatd mean you have shit taste
and you are my go to guy for what good shit to play
ill just say im not a big fan of the humor.
whats this for, 4th graders?
u mean p3?
i hope p3 is a more serious story because i love the general concept of persona games
the days and social links
the combat is not the best not the worst
maybe its better in p3 and p5
also is romancing aigis true ending of p3
what is then
also what romance do i need for true ending of p4 BECAUSE IF ITS FUCKING RISE
oh ok
just optional part?
ok
isnt it an achiv
isnt she useful in combat
ill defo do that
is true ending a cabbage party thrown by adachi and dojima
are those obvious or no
ill just do it blindly then
can i be unsure of what im doing and still max all social links
p4 will be a long project because bavaria school is 7-9 hours
and when i get home i wanna just sleep
i dont mean school hours
how much is serbian hell
from when to when
mine is 7 30 - 2 30 up to 4 30
also
will i get emotional at persona 3 ending
because its like 200 hours with the characters
and i got attached to and sad for niko after just 8 hours of playing oneshot
i think thats normal for oneshot tho
i dont even know what happens and i already feel very bad for aigis
@ZeldaLord make archie listen to kimi no kioku hes refusing to
i dont screenshare zelda
im too paranoid to screenshare full pc
incognito ignores vpn pretty sure so it could show an ad of a local bavaria business or something
im very paranoid ok
anyway dm him to listen to it
i think hes sane enough currently to not send you anything except maybe slurs
ITS NOT ON INCOGNITO
ok tell him
?
?
who?
i have shit eyesight what is it supposed to be
of who
she looks ugly
there is no persona porn zeldalord
well maybe there is idk i didnt actually check
i just cant wait for pixels reaction
when he wakes up to that
the pie chart same as the last one will be completely random numbers dw
zelda do you seriously think
i went through 48 images of gay porn yesterday
when i couldve just pulled the numbers out of my ass
WHY ARE YOU ON OKBP
EVEN I DONT GO THERE ANYMORE
i just muted it
but sometimes it still shows up
for some reason
YEA SAME
WHY THE FUCK DOES IT APPEAR
why the fuck
hes a schizo gay loser
why
get magnus
(i wont post anything)
yes
kimi no kioku has this feeling and vibe to it thats hard to explain but
its so fucking well designed for the ending
which afaik its aigis grieving over and trying to come to terms with makoto dying
from whos pov is the song
are multiple verses from multiple characters
serbia
you need to go there
it would be so fucking funny
what if insteaf of being called persona it was called pexsona
and you summoned benny melk to eat kfc
is this the average serbian name
it looks like a russian one
its only 35$ hearing persona irl would be crazy
if only i was miserable/serbian and could go there
if persona starts playing you should record it
legendary pj moment
anyway imma go play p4
lmk when
wdym
omg yosuke got a pissowner
everyone has a pissowner????
is adachis pissowner a cabbage
misery
teddie was born from misery

NOW YUKIKO ON THE TV
AND THEN IN SCHIZOLAND
zelda
its gonna be
saki dead
yukiko dead
and then adachi will die
and then ill buy a rope
can they not throw someone else in the tv
like stupid walmart child
is that an actual spoiler
i dont wanna open it
istfg
if nanako is the main villain
shes very responsible and smart for a 5 year old walmart child
so idk
and OBSESSED with tvs
she probably does it unintentionally or smt
or her shadow?
either her or teddie
teddie is awfully suspicious and u told me rise replaces him when she appears
WONDER WHY
you have not seen me cooking up ark theories
that was peak schizophrenia
but i feel like im on the right track here
are you sure
you are probably gaslighting
although its prob nanako
@ZeldaLord sl time
explain
magician arcana
do i have a magician arcana
i only have 1 pissowner rn
stupid???
oh yukiko is at the inn
shes fine
@ZeldaLord is this one of the points where you mentioned you wanted to stop playing?

the black king thing or wtv
i havent done anything run ending yet right
what would u consider run ending
the bait has gone too far
im just gonna give up
pixel is far too insane anyway
ok
give me just 1 example of a major fuckup
i went way to deep in the bait but pixel looks mortifed
dont read gc for ur own sake
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord
i went on the fabled "egg_irl" to laugh
and theres a p3p pfp in the comments
ive been looking at it for funny for like 3 years now and im not becoming and trans
the fucking femc
oh i didnt even see wgat you responded to
how many pixel dms did you get?
did he cry all night
wtf
i had to
say allat
and he didnt even cope
im slowly starting to give up on the pixel torture
nothing really seems to work
would pixel stop if we all just ignored him
or is he too far gone
why is tere a weird fox
thats really useful
sp is harder to heal than hp
@ZeldaLord WHY THE FUCK WAS YU WORRIED WHEN YOSUKE LOOKED UNDER THE FUTON
IS IT CANON THAT THEYRE ALL FUCKING PORN ADDIICTS OR SOMETHING
porn addict students and pedophile teachers
this truly has been our persona 4
yosuke rank 5
he asked "do you keep the good under your futon"
"i will check when you are pissing and expose your tastes"
why the fuck are they gooners?????????
FLOYD-CHAN
how do i get the angel statue and demon statue
thats what i thought
but when yosuke looked under the futon
yu looked worried.
how do i get better expression and courage rq
"bypass"
yes
ADACHI GOES IN TV
ADACHI IS TEDDIE
THEYRE SO SIMILAR
oh he just goons at junes im far too schizo
ADACHER
LMFAO
NO
THEY ADDED GAY PEOPLE TO PERSONA
IM QUITTING
bro i started to like yosuke why does he have to be a weird gooner
OHHH THATS NAOTO
i got this so many times
how do i incresae courage zelda
@ZeldaLord remember the gay porn episode of p4?
im at THAT part rn.
MAN ARGUING WITH ARCHITECTHORS FAGGOTRY AND DEALING WITH THE PERSONA FAGGOTS FAG VOICE REALLY ISNT HELPING MY MENTAL HEALTH
CAN I JUST FULLY SKIP THIS PART
public doxxing is bad and all BUT
removing him from the account means nothing to me
its funnier if i delete the profile
he would genuinely kill himself
its his entire life
why
i dont give a singular fuck about skyblock, zelda
and?
do i care?
no because i dont play?
he would be mad if i played
but im not making myself miserable just to make someone else more miserable
this is why i am just gonna ignore pixel from now on
man i lost all my will to play pissowner now
you know what started this entire argument zeldalord one?
me not wanting to do 30 hours of a miserable grind for 1.5 skyblock levels (nothing) because i have irl shit to do and better games to play
hes so fucking addicted to skyblock that he thinks hes entitled to making me play so the grinds are more efficient
@ZeldaLord genuinely what do i do
this shit ends today
not an option
i dont want to leave the sb community with him spreading lies about me 24/7 how im a ratter looter etc
any other options
im thinking about it a lot recently which is bad
because i dont want to overthink BLOCK GAME SHIT
nah he knows how schizo i am
about all personal and security shit
sp what else
everyone in skyblock is like him or worse sadly
where do i
does that
make him unable to spout lies about me after?
i want to reach a conclusion
where both of us are somehow satisfied then can block eachother permanently and never talk to eachother again
but hes so fucking immature and selfish
i literally offered him a conclusion which any non selfish person would be happy about
which was me never playing again and only caring about investments
but he had the audacity to tell me to leave my own minecraft account linked to my irl microsoft
and he said if i care about investments i should flip for 2 hours a day minimum
like who the fuck is he bro
hes a mentally disturbed french 15 yearo ld
we were actually good close friends at the time
we were until recently
when he started gooning to skyblock
and now he copes about shit, has a massive ego, became very selfish and acts gay sometimes
ok zelda
i have
reached a conclusion
ill get the account wiped intentionally but through an actual 90d ban
that way he gets off my dick permanently because hell be mad as shit
but he cant get me banned anywhere for it
no not really
if i can be bothered to i can even place the blame on him
stupid no manipulateable yes
pixel is
an interesting case.
how did i
it wasnt a threat zelda
its just a funny reminde
ive done it a few times
its still weird enough to a point
that he gets creeped out
because if he doesnt then im concerned
the thing is zelda
i have done shit in the past that is very much wipeable
very much.
nah zelda
remove that element from this scenario completely
i know how id deal with it
focus on the other aspects of it
theres this thing ive used in the past a few times thats a bit hard to pull off but it works well on mentally weak people
you and preferrably a bit more people make fun of someone and convince them their beliefs based on objective truth are wrong and that theyre just schizoing which leads to an internal conflict within themselves that makes them question if theyre just insane for believing it
its more of a long term gaslight
although
in this scenario a few things could maybe go wrong
it is by FAR the safest one
but for now
ill just see if theres any reason to coming to a more peaceful conclusion
quite literally the last attempt
nanako rank 3!
FUCK
I MISSED 3 POINTS
BECAUSE NO COURAGE
HOW THE FUCK DO YOU GET COURAGE POINTS IN THIS FUCKING GAME
wow thats hard
how can i go to the hospital it isnt avaliable yet
what gives courage
BRO I ACCIDENTALLY ASKED OUT THE UGLY BITCH
@ZeldaLord what info do i need for teddie
i need to gather info for teddie so i can go fight the gay guy in schizoland
i did
where do i find marie btw
OHHH I NEED TO FIND NAOTO
I WAS CONFUSED BECAUSE EVERYONE SAID BOY
i did im geting nowhere
so where is yukiko
its sunday
google dot com told me shes supposes to be in south shopping district
sh is not
shes not thp
.
SHE IS NOT THERE
the z button says everyone spent time with her on that day
thats why im asking you zeldalord
ive checked everywhere in the game
ok im going in the tv
rw reference on lethal company subreddit
didnt play for over an hour
had to do some bs
actually enjoyabke and addicting
but FUCK YOU TEDDIE BURN IN HELL
im just gonna do the same with rise as i do with the loli
press z and wait
ig
how many dungeons are in the game btw
and how annoying is gay sex dungeon
yea
is kanjis shadow self that hes gay or something
i thought japan hated gay people why is it being normalized in pissowner 4
then explain that cutscene
on midnight channel
🙏
wait whats the akechi explanation then
is he just not gay in the source material
oh is persona one of THOSE fandoms
where they make everyone gay
despite noone being gay
i genuinely thought half the cast was gay from what i saw on okbp
then why is there an entire community
of people obsessively shipping them
Stupid???
?
thats so obviously a joke
is that the only reason people think theyre gay
????
anyways
do i max adachi sl
before anything else
i really want to
oh i got that earlier today :(
im at rank 1
what were your sls end of may
i have yosuke 6 chie 3 nanako 4 athletes 4 dojima 1 some random mother 1 band loli 2 fox 1 adachi 1
ARK is slowly Fading Away..
zelda
we had a deal remember

i have p
4

why not

zelda i swear on my life that this is real
i seriously need to get out of this community
because what the fuck
@ZeldaLord ARCHIE GOT SENT A DIFFERENT PIC BY THE SAME GUY AND IT CONFIRMED THAT ITS REAL BECAUSE ITS THE SAME BED
bed in pic i got sent vs bed in pic archie got sent
is this how sexual harassment victims feel
thats a 19 year old femboy sending thigh and maid dress pictures to a 16 year old and 15 year old
funnily enough there was a groomer in this same community not long ago
hes gone now but i think he also targetted me and archie but we were too retarded to notice and thought it was jokes
so nothing came of it
but a few of our friends had horrible experiences with that guy
"nidachi"
@ZeldaLord i might have found an excuse
to remove access
hes threatening to void a 5b item because i changed skin to adachi
and if he does i think its objectively justified to remove access
AHAHAHA
ZELDA
WANNA SEE COMEDY
pixel art ubilding is effort :(
30d ban isnt a wipe??
i need a 90d ban wipe
i need a new dupe
so i can do that
yea ill prob do it when he goes to sleep
IM ACTUALLY
SO FUCKING MAD
LIKE I HAVENT BEEN THIS FUCKING MAD OVER INTERNET SHIT IN SO LONG
THE FUCKING AUDACITY AND SELFISHNESS
i thought he was stupid
i thought he was spewing bullshit
ok but
if im being honest
this is COMPLETELY his fault
im not doing anything on the account
im letting him do whatever tf he wants unless its extremely stupid
and he wants me to grind???
hes that fucking selfish???
i even offered to some grinds but later on
like look at this
zelda
i can take a massive gamble
its basically 50/50
maybe more in my favor depends
if the gamble pays off i can either force him to come to a peaceful conclusion or get him banned everywhere
zelda idgaf
answer me
read what i said
do i?
if the gamble doesnt pay off however
i am even more fucked
ok let me explain the situation
basically the gamble is talking to one of me and archis closest friends who is NORMAL and SANE
and we have a gc and shit too
and maybe he could calm him down and force him to a peaceful conclusion
and if he doesnt want to we could get him fucked
no zelda thats not the point
the entire point is hell be unbiased
unless one of us do something obviously bad
in that case he sides with the other
thats tthe thing i cant
theres a very small possibility
that archie already dmd him
and lied and shit
but i cant know
so best i can do is make him screenshare smt
and see if archie is high in dms list
zelda am i officially reddit mod gooner
the main thing on my mind isnt irl shit but goonblock drama
this is genuinely so fucking miserable
kms kms kms kms kms kms kms
why cant he just be normal and resolve this like a normal fucking person
ALL THIS OVER
A FUCKING
ADACHI SKIN BTW
AVERAGE FUCKING 15 YEAR OLD MOOD SWINGS
p4 time
pexblock doesnt exist pexblock doesnt exist pexblock doesnt exist pexblock doesnt exist pexblock doesnt exist pexblock doesnt exist pexblock doesnt exist pexblock doesnt exist pexblock doesnt exist pexblock doesnt exist pexblock doesnt exist

LET ME FUCKING GUESS

same thing as with niko, a child forced to take on way too much responsibility
its sad
you sent for courage
wheres the hostpial

pixels future wife
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
SHES TALKING ABOUT PYRAMIDS AND EGYPT LMAO
i really wanna get aigis dlc
after p3r
but apparently its ass
okbp people werent ragebaiting
p4 is actually good
rank4 yukiko alr
Pinned a message.
?
???
i bought it as a joke
but its good
what simple bait
i like to overcomplicate shit i do
when i gaslight people i do it a very overcomplicated way for example
when did you call it that
idr
oh ON pixel
OH MY GOD THERES SO MUCH
hey zelda
ark is pretty good despite its bugs
its a flawe
*kills himself*
the flochforster account accountshare was a flawed masterpiece
also
whenever they make a p4 with actual graphics ill prob be buying it
this game would be 345930 times better with an updated combat system and better graphics
saki mentioned
im tearing up
(send this to pixel)
basically ive found the perfect bait zelda
id rather not be informed of such things
anyways
im gonna pretend i stopped ragebaiting
and completely stop with degen and disgusting shit
but just completely casually act like a degen sad msierable person
acting like an incel for persona 2d girls
pixel will actually kill himself for that
because he wont be doubting it and thinking its bait
insert jonkler troll emoji
the persona 5 joker, zeldalord
the commitment will be crazy
i will have to act like belk but more mature so it doesnt look like bait
what do i replace
@ZeldaLord please expalin
I NEED EXPRESSION POINTS
what do i
how do i get a ton of epresio nfast
it says drama club
does band club also
or nah
???????????????????
he took my ragebait and.. MADE IT WORSE?

im just like "yea whatever who cares" no matter what happens
well it isnt a time thing
just how sleep deprived i am
wait actually no
i was depressed for a day when a tek quetzal me and archie were taming died
to make it worse i was awake for 42h at that time
and right after it died i had to go to my doctor
just look in pixel dms
is it good if im balancing out all social links to have them around same level
or do i rush some
GG
will i cry when i see it
YESSSS
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
yea?

a guy called "JustJex"
architecthor thinks its comedy because "haha pex so funny"
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG

CMON ZELDA
ITLL BE FUN!
im nto actually
i just want pixel to be scared
is that another one of
joker x akechi
who
BRO
WHY DID HE
OPEN IT
???
DOWNBAD LMFAOOO
WHAT
flochforster vs ghost leviathan 2
im not im just posting sex scene moments
i dont stream
but if both of u would join then id stream it
should i be safe or tease the ghost
@ZeldaLord there are 2
GG
?????????????
just a simple 2 line joke with a punchline
was enough for bait
someone ive never spoken to just asked for account share
archie also hates him
and hes maybe even worse than him
do i kick off archie for that guy just to spite him
persona refrence isnt it
comments say "reflects physical"
thats suspiciously similar to a dungeon enemy in p4
LMFAO
IT WAS ON AN UNRELATED SUB BTW
i got jumpscared by disturbing the piss in a random racist video in goonblock server once
i showed u right
the itsudatte hits even harder in the og ver
and in the og ver even at the start you already see this feeling of dread and grief under the cheerfullness of the voice
is p3p or p3r sadder
also ngl i kinda wanna buy p3p not p3r because ive started to like the visuals of p4
thr artstyle isnt shit actually
the ps2 style is personally very nostalgic to me
and the character sprites are very well made
what about original p3
GG
ok ig
but this isnt a way for u to escape playing p3p when i play p3r
the moment i launch p3r youre launching p3p
GG
piss owner three portable
mentally weak
show
atlus art inconsistency is uh something
the sprites are very well made then the characters look like something i could make in blender with no prior experience
p4 remake will be so peak
also why does ADACHI of all characters have the most polished model??
same
how is it so much of a diff then
ohhh
makes sense
WHY IS OUR LIGHT ACTUALLY SO GOOD
english
do i try the yapan one too
wym
GG
its peak tho
GG
@ZeldaLord i checked the fanfic it isnt gay porn
its jonkler x the redhead
@ZeldaLord is there any sad shit in p4 ending
like p3
or just leaving Pexico, Yapan
do i click on that

zelda its bait for pixel and carrot once they see it shut up
i do actually put seasoning
every meal is as the one i sent a few days back
except sometimes i put some curry too
or make it spicy rarely
hey look away for a bit
pixel made me
pretty mad
ok so you look away now zelda
im going to post something
zelda
it is not porn
or suggestive
let me send it it isnt nsfw in the slightest
i can send to you first
i was just building it up
its literally just this
let me send it
what else was i supposed to put
Started a call that lasted 0 minutes.
this is
VERY
important
(the call is so you come here now)
@ZeldaLord

@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
oh my god im gonna kms
the hallways are filled with fucking TIKTOK WHITE GIRL MUSIC
because some bitches dont have ANY HEADPHONES OR CONSIDERATION FOR OTHER PEOPLE
and teachers dont gaf???
@ZeldaLord architecthor became emo
archie started listening to white girl music
send the mp3, zeldalord.
deleted
also when i spoiler something
its exclusively so you and carrot dont see it
hey zelda
wanna know something funny
i was reading old messages in "Cowshed" and saw someone mention they read a 700k word fanfic with akechi as the main character
it was a touhou fanfiction? idfk why akechi was there
yea its a very weird seever
.
send video link
i have the opportunity to do something SO FUCKING FUNNY
archie watches videos on this game.
and he hates persona.
WAIT BY THAT THUMBNAIL I THINK HE SENT ME THAT??
oh. my. god.
kill yourself nigger but thats not the main thing rn
"with instakills only"
whats the timestamp of persona references
hes asleep or smt
watch more on it its a really fun game
the graphics are something but it was made in a few months in 2016
ive considered playing it too when i have a bit more free time
gamejolt i think?
only from steam iirc
why wpuld euros be regional
stupid?
ye i saw
how did u only finish the video now tho
i did like 5 mins ago
(started at the 13min)
oh yea zelda
there might be persona fans at my school
i saw some guy with an aot sweater
and last week i saw a jjk shirt
so
who knows
is it like pissowner where its only avaliable on certain days?
ZELDA I LOOKED IT UP
"12th attack on belgrade's pride info center"
LMFAO
zelda whos ratko mladic again
ik i heard about him before
was he the one who did those 2 genocides
i was in vienna 2y ago in june
everything was fagified and there was a pride store
do you think theres a bavaria pride store
i doubt it tho idt bavaria invented gay people yet
when does it close
ok i was right
you are serbian
is yugoslavia lore as interesting as it appears to be
i looked into it a bit recently seems interesting
LMFAO
WITH THE "NUH UH"????
holocaust denial serbian edition
what the FUCK is the context behind middle left photo
zelda
you know how i learned about srebrenica a few years ago?
through some schizo acid trip children cartoon
which is lost media
thats even worse
architecthor is invading belgrade
next thing you see zelda
will be massive posters of gay porn everywhere (its apparently funny)
oh yea tf was up with that
gigaglazing
why was xi jinping in belgrade
alao how long has the pride store existed
what is the new diddy lore
did he think
50 million dollars would excuse him being a pedophile
@ZeldaLord apparenrly its existed since at least 2018
also theres been pride parades and shit in belgrade since 2001???
???
you are joking righ
yes how does that change him being a pedophile
he would "diddle" 73 more kids in that time
anyway why does he have 784 dildos
what does he do with them
i wonder if be bought them at the serbia pride store
they definitely sell them there
HOLY SHIT
also archie knew about the pissowner
how do i
BACKUP MY SAVE FILES
zela im not stupid
i know that
where do i access the save files
where do i find program files thingy again i forgot
ok found
this??????
is it
KYS
HOW DO I
wdym "yooud goon"
why the fuck would i????????????????????????
the worst thing ive ever looked up of persona were those fanfics
all the persona suggestive material ive sent was from archie
nah
just skipped to sex scenes and screenshotted
im disgusted by fags i could never read that shit
thats also why i hated persona at first
okbp made me think every character is gay
this is the same issue i had with pancake episode 🥹
????
why is there no data
ok im in system32
where do i find it
where can i check how many points you need for each rank
yea
i meant not in save
but in general
do i add 3 points for all of them and check
???
where do i save my changes
no zelda
why is it 66 points.
ight
ill play tmr i dont have much time today
acc no because i have a test on monday!
others are like 15-25
nanako having most with 29
wait can do it all in one painful fusion hell session
how much would u say ive done of persona so far
im at start of august
so im like 50% done?
.
but zelda it took you 200 hours
im 40h in
about what
what pissowner character shit
???
i have 9h of 40h afl
oh should i?

oh yea
what personas are good
what should i get for 4th dungeon
what if i did very hard
I PUT 30+ POINTS
rise scares me
its digital sexual assault
idc if you say "mentally weak" its genuinely fucking weird
OH THAT
WHY DID HE THINK ID SEND PORN EBCAUSE OF THAT
WHY DID HE THINK OF THAT
NOT EVEN ARCHIE WOULD THINK OF THAT WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH HIM
I JUST WANTED TO ASK TO KNOW WHAT THE MOST NORMAL CHOICES WERE
I WOULDNT EVEN BE DOING ROMANCES IF IT WASNT AN ACHIV
💀
mitsuru?
im defo choosing aigis just because of the story and kimi no kioku
what the fuck.
is my degenerate persona (persona reference) THAT fucking convincing???
i havent gooned in like over a year
wym weird
please dont tell me aigis is sexual or something
she looks sane
so like
marie?
man why
is yukari not sane
she looks normal
does kimi no kioku have same effect even if you dont romance aigis
and the endings entirety
who did you do in p5
makoto?
yea
when i was looking through it she looked sanest
others looked weird and retarded
kasumi looks like 14
so no way in hell
also
did they ever make a p2 remake
actually mentally ill
WHAT
BUT I THOUGHT HES THE KILLER
KYS
wym
?
GG
SAME FUCKING CHOICES LMFAO
its true that they all appear the sanest
what level do i get for this udngeon
@ZeldaLord just so you know this time i put 40 points
do i need max knowledge or max knowledge rank
also for aiya meal what do i need
put 100 points into nanako
tf is that
explain
@ZeldaLord archie became a lethal hypersweat
hes also emo now i think? hard to know for sure
@ZeldaLord "go to junes to find adachi" WELL ADACHI ISNT HERE
zelda
WHY IS ADACHI NOT AT JUNES
THE NEXT STEP REQUIRES ME TO FIND HIM THERE
im on 29th (i fuckedu p a bit)
I CAN DO TUTORING SL
YEP
@ZeldaLord ONE. HUNDRED. POINTS.
no lmao
points always fix it
also the nigger at tofu store isnt showing up so i lost a ton of potential sls
its the 2nd.
i fucked up a day
then everything got delayed into pexico
zelda
i really need to pull the trigger
the weird polish incel guy obsessed and probably actually romantically interested in archie is constantly steam dming me about his relationship with archie and shit
and how archie isnt talking to him much anymore/ignoring him
i want to KILL MYSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

💀
pj really has become a persona fanclub gc
actually true
what ive seen from okbp
made persona seem like something id never in my life wnat to play
its actually fun tho
zelda
okbc is not nearly as deranged as okbp
but fair point
i liked it when it was absurdism
also okbp thinks pedophilia is funny
"haha lets sexualise 15 year olds haha lets sexualise joker being with a 30 year old teacher"
why do you think im ignoring it like the plague
the schizoposts can be funny but sometimes its genuinely fucking crepy
like those fellas are forgetting about the fucking canon ages of characters

he thinks skyblock is our fucking job or soemthing
he also doesnt seem to understand
that during exam week
i would not like to spend my only 2-3 free hours a day on skyblcok

WHY IS THIS AN OPTION
prob tomr or the day after
how long will p3 be btw
i can prob finish p4 in 100-120 hours
why
#1 PERSONA PLAYER
GOT 10 MAX SL ACHVS
are the combat systems better
because in p4 it makes you deal less damage and get less xp
p4 combat can get very boring and repetitive
is it same in p3 and p5
i cant wait to hear disturbing the piss in p3
when you get ambushed or when you ambush
is it easier to ambuhs in p3
p4 is so weird
yeah
the movement kinda sucks
and the camera turning
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
also
any less boring dungeon designs?
i want more variety

i literally did lucnh with rise (hell) and "not ready to advance)
in p3
how many times can i do a sl not first try
im booting up p3r

namatame had a motive for first 2 tho so idk..
its gonna be like fucking teddie or something
maybe marie??????
pixel is never avaliable just like carrot
thats the reason pjbw is fucking dead
the game will be done today tho
becayse fuck sleep!!!!!
how hars to miss are the choices
GG
biology hits a new low
biology class OUTSIDE
(40 of us on like 5 logs in the school yard)

???????
i didnt look up porn thats the pixel emoji
i just did open link
KILL YOURSELF
KILL. YOURSELF.
i just had to pick it.
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
how the fuck???
dw theres no skin
i just named one of the 5 billion default ones that
but ill bring it up a lot to tease pixel
zelda this is
an OPPORTUNITY
i can literally boot him for playing omori
the moment i see that steam notif
i am pulling the trigger
because him being a faggot is an excuse
zelda skyblock is a community for sure
one time a guy got away with ratting because the person he ratted was trans
well not really away he got banned everywhere but he still has friends and people still respect him???
and still is in some servers
archie is in his "open minded and trying everything" and also doubting everything phase
(hes on his way to becoming gay)
(hes listening to japan little girls singing songs and wants to buy omori)
i made him listen to it twice
he said its mid both times
on first listen
on second listen i loved it
i dont like this one
KILL YOURSELF!
do any persona songs have a good mv?
i made him listen to a japan song once because it had a "good mv"
music video
how do i make him give kimi no kioku a chance instead of him just thinking "gay persona shit"
kimi no kioku is the best persona song
how.
i really like the p4 ost
which one is really good from p3 again
i forgot the name
MY LIGHT LIKE OUR LIGHT??!?!?!
GG
put our light but name it smt else so it isnt persona
anyway my fav from p4 would be heaven
full moon full life
that ones also really good
havent heard it yet
i will today prob
also can i revisit dungeons like i did for yukikos castle
i wanna revisit heaven
fav dungeon
i skip it because rise
and teddie
and low quality
also when is adachi dungeon
i wanna save my cutie pie day one
also make one of those for heaven
the things
pex
insanity...
ight
ILLNESS
what date is adachi dungeon
OH FOG IS STILL HERE????
@ZeldaLord IS SHIT GONNA GO DOWN ZELDA
oh yea sorry to torture you but
稲葉曇
稲葉曇『ラグトレイン』Vo. 歌愛ユキ
inabakumori - Lagtrain (Vo. Kaai Yuki)
稲葉曇です。
can you listen to this shit archi likes it
is there any similar persona ost to this shit
ok
if i dont forgetr
hi babe <333
dw baby ill rescue you the milisecond your dungeon opens
you wont have to suffer <333
oh that one
i guess ill be skipping the p5 intro
but theres gay people being gay in it
oh ok
thank god nanako survived
FUCK
WOW THE LYRICS TO HEAVEN ARE FUCKED UP
VERY FUCKED UP
THE FUCKING WALMART OBSESSION WAS A COPING MECHANISM ZELDA
THE FUCKING WALMART OBSESSION IS BECAUSE SHES ALONE WITH NOTHING TO DO FOR HER ENTIRE LIFE
zelda i stopped hating walmart child when i realized the sad reality of her life like day 2 or 3 of playing the game
like 1/3 through her sl
fog theme isnt that good
LMFAO
THIS IS FUCKED UP NGL
also
naoto is probably one of my favorite characters in persona 4
who were yours
it is
whens shit gonna go down again?
december is near zelda
yea thats why i like her
and has an interesting character arc
@ZeldaLord why are people saying naoto is trans
her entire thing is to accept herself as a woman because she presented herself as a man due to sexism
her becoming trans literally DEFEATS THE POINT OF HER CHARACTER?
p4 is a massive reminder of how dead media literacy is
all these characters (except fucking rise) are so different as theyre presented in persona reddit
they have character discussions on their fucking headcanons of characters zelda
LMA
no when someone corrects them they act like thats the actual character and make up bullshit to defend their case
this also happens
in every fandom
ever
jjk is a live example of it
aot 2-3 years ago i dont even want to think about.
not even that
on actual persona subreddits i read about p4 characters because the anime made me think its the worst game of the century
it was all HEADCANONS
one thing the okbp retards are right about tho
p4 has one of the best casts in a videogame (except rise and teddie)
just opened phone to check lmao
time to find a semi serious post
OH GOD THATS RISE WITH GALAXY GAS
yes.
OH MY GOD
I SAW SOMETHING SO HORRID ZELDA
NO I SAW SOMETHING EVEN WORSE ZELDA
why is there man on okbp wtf
aslume????
stupid?????
i found people lusting for HISANO
?????????????
in the comments i also saw "u/Naotosfuckslave"
nahhh im done with this subreddit
not fucking worth it
ill just tlel you what ive seen in the past there
makoto is depressed, soulless, edgy
yukari is a "girlboss"
junpei is retarded
fuuka is depressed and emo and "relatable"
mitsuru is lesbian and "girlboss" and "mommy"
aigis is depressed and people simp over her more than anyone
wheres the guy afraid of cats
deleted message?
GG.
gexico
the cat is outside dojimas
and hes not at flood plaion
*end of sl line*
"yeah this mf is trans bro trust me"
ye
@ZeldaLord why is rises story actually interesting and sad but her character is the most obnoxious whore ever
i cucked her
i think after rise
its just eri, ai and naoki left
OH YEA FOX
FUCK THE FOX
im rank 6 only
i keep forgetting to
my current one is always late lol
dont let pixel see this
?
@ZeldaLord so fella
did u listen to the archie song
are any persona songs similar to it?
lyrics dont matter just like how it sounds ig
actually maybe lyrics do matter because architecthor has a depression phase
he was literally coping about being happy all the time to me earlier
"its so fucked im never sad"
"being happy always is boring"
he WANTS to be a fake depression 14 year old girl so bad
anyway
also @ZeldaLord rate the archi depression song out of 10 i want to send to him
稲葉曇
稲葉曇『ラグトレイン』Vo. 歌愛ユキ

@ZeldaLord
ill just stream to u
im gonna talk and im gonna say PEX many times
generational bait
shut up im baiting pixel you nigger
dont spoil me
no shit it is
ik p4 is the worst one
pixel and carrot tend to get very mad when i act overtly ignorant
its better bait than degenerate shit
which of them are ingame though
all were outside sources
1. comedic relief goofball
2. to show the police is incompetent and force the narrative that the high school kids are the only hope for this case
and any other clues?
what
they dotn???
hes retarded

?????????????
???????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????????????????????????????

vanya said akechi is a loveable character
i mean
still not as bad as pixelrot
is he one of those characters u like after they die
ok name ur fav characters from p4 and p5
uve been dodging this for weeks
ok but im actually curious tho
for p5
i wanna know which game has best characters
out of p3 and p5
can u like rank for p3 and p5 which game does what better
so i know what to play
nah for specifics
like
character
story
villain
combat
characters
gameplay
graphics
time management
tyyy
KAZE NO KOE
HIKARI NO TSUBU
MADOROMU KIMI NI SOSOGU
how cancer it is to max all sls and achivs in the timeframe
anyway please do the thing so i can eepy in the beb
if we ignore the fact i used save editor for points i fucked up with wrong pissowner im gonna have over a month free
i should be done on 24th
so
yosuke chie yukiko kanji naoto?
anywa plese do this
just list where one is better
FUCKKKK
it says p3 and p4 are like 2 hours..
which is it not?
anyway i dk anything about p3 really
i just know:
1. makoto and aigis sad
2. makoto die because he kill nyx goddess of death
then p5 i know quite a bit
maruki, yablabdoh, akechi dies on a ship, sumire is a fucking schizo
and thats all for p5
i knew way more about p4 than p3 and p5 tbh
does p3 have good story tho
it seems kinda bland when just looking at it not knowing anything
does it have smt to keep u going like p4 mystery
is shit better explained in p3 and p5 btw
p4 just didnt explain some shit at all
yeah
shit like
bugs and fishing
and conditions
and quests
and items
anyway name best character from p3
i know their names and stereotypes but thats it
theres so many
and explainrd badly
kex
no image for item kys!!!
is p3p or p3r sadder
thats good ig
is item menu better designed
the circumstances of the ending and writing and shit
p4 is good but GOD do the menus suck ass
dis they make it sadder
fallen idol
can u show me one frame from p3r rq
im getting so downbad for actual visuals
~~she started undressing in front of the cop in a desperate attempt to get out of the situation~~
wow that looks so good
is there also a bigger outsidr area and more than a straight line to walk through
p5?
WTFFFFF
PLAYING IT FIRST
why tf
THE 3D MODELS LOOK SO GOOD
WATCHED SHORT COMPARISON VID W P3P THIS IS SO GOOD ZELDA WTF
bro wtf this looks peak
p4 needs a remake so bad
@ZeldaLord did they ever announce one
and when do you think?
p4 is pretty good it would sell very well
surely theyve already been working on it
tbh its not that bad
introduced me to 3 great games
~~i wouldve got them earlier if he wasnt extremely annoying about it tho~~
i was planning on getting p3 in like mid july or earlier but pixel just HAD TO bring it up every 2 seconds
ye
and was being extremely obnoxious about all persona shit too
also i went on okbp in august
which made me want to never buy the games
wanna know something sad
okbp ships YU AND YOSUKE
ye i saw
idm it that much since its adults and not gay
im just not very fond of them ok
oh ye
p4 had no gay people do p3 and p5 have any of those things or nah
i love japan more and more man
also why are there mfs that genuinely ship gay shit then
???
some people genuinely want yosuke and akechi romance routes
????
isnt sumire fucking 15
LIKE THE FUCKIG
GREEN GUY FROM MAIRO??
SO LIKE WHY THE FU K???
1 30 am shower
anyway i should sleep
no school tomorrow because slight sickness excuses me from 9h of bavarian school
the true origin is fucked up
so ill just give the fake one
a lethal company clip where i walk into the facility and see archie and a spider which was causing problems earlier both dead and say "The Spider" in an extremely zesty voice
owner of piss
idk its stupid
imagine a terrorist attack with persona planes
our light plays as the pentagon is destroyed by suicide bombers in persona themed planes
would the phantom thieves suicide bomb to change the hearts of the us?
i got in recommendations

sanest converstion
when pixel made some character for his game

biology bitch thinks its a good idea for us to go for an outside lesson which would last 3 hours
like 40 of us on like 5 logs
then we all started to molest eachother out of boredom and she ragequit and let us go home
it was so fucking funny
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
WHAT WATER WAS SHE TALKING ABOUT ZELDA
I WANT TO FUCKING KNOW
TAP WATER????????
YEA NO
just
skip
oh yea what does she do if you call her situations stupid and criticize them?
she is actually smart wtf
probably has zero education, makes up schizo bullshit and its legal because thats what the class is for
actual legal loophole
oh that reminds me of when a guy said hell report me to the german police for online death threats because i got him banned from a server (when later asked to provide said death threats to moderators of that discord he backed out)
zelda that guy and your teacher are the exact same
1. pathological liar
2. makes up bullshit threats
3. masive ego
zelda your teacher is raidermc
has she leaked architecthors face reveal to the class yet
because its the only thing she can do after becoming irrelevant and being banned everywhere
which is your second worst class
only bad class i can think of would be biology and art (dont ask why i have that shit bavaria is just retarded)
do you also have art in serbia
when
last year?
here we have it for entirety of hs
how is it in miserableland
we cant choose much here
some shit is just mandatory
idk why art is
also zelda thoughts on PHILOSOPHY
we have that shit for SOME fucking reason
i cant really speak on phiolsophy because
we all skip
each year we just do the same shit with verbs
and for SOME reason theres still "new words" to learn????????????????????????????????????????????
and the funny thing is
everyone can speak english well here
everyone finds it extremely stupid not just me (i lived in us)
we have a 45yo fat body positivity english teacher
i like teachers who just let u do whatever the fuck u want if u prove that u alr know all the shit theyre yapping about
some exist here thankfully
yk whats funny
every german here can speak english well
but the accent and pronounciation is SO FUCKING BAD
i literally developed a german accent just from talking to friends
its miserable
also
in foreign countries like germany
why is most of english writing shit down??
the main problem people here have is PRONOUNCIATION
oh yea in like 2 weeks
were supposed to do the 3h outside biology class again
every lesson here literally ends when the fucking bell rings and the lesson isnt even done yet...
ask her about pissowner in private.
do it.
the rot spreading out of discord would be poetic
i am looking for a persona fan at school to spread the rot
GG
IN BELGRADE TOO?
id make it my pfp but people would call me a faggot because its anime and pixel made the face look really gay
adachi aigis?
you mean 2 years ago?
yeah..
those times are long gone
LOL DOES IT
DID I NEVER CANCEL LMFAO
well i cba
ill do the same
need these back
man why does it have to be tomorrow
im ordering shit tmr
ill buy on monday or smt
oh  ok
does the 3$ nitro let you have a custom banner?
i really wanna have a p4 banner
.
zz
LMAO
JUST READ IT
THE ENDING IS SO FUCKING ASS WHAT THE FUCK
and gojo is dead just so you know
the Ideal would be playing all ARK maps the Real is that im playing all 3 Persona games
take a pic of that sticker
next time ur there
i want to examine it
take a pic
when ur there
are there any other pissowner hints btw
like which persona character is her hair like?
i wonder what that fine gentleman has saved on his pc
(its archie)
whyd they make him french
is he interested in adults and women?
fucka?
mitsuru?
wwhy is she french of al lpeopel
why tf
why not
make it japanese
or keep it englis
which
i missed it ig
who
does jonkler ever speak french..
what
anyway whats the french in p4
oh yea check my p4 review tr
i have to deal with 2 french fucks daily
on discord
architecthor and another friend
what is it
ykw zelda
im glad the rot happened so i discovered p4
although he spammed it way too much and if he wasnt so annoying i wouldve gotten it months earlier
its still how i found out about it
WHAT
leclownic?
how is moonlight daydream unofficial but so good
THERES MORE????
im really excited for p3 because i know nothing
i have way more info about p5
actually i have more info on p5 than i did on p4 before i started it
i know its a differnet loading screen
will i cry after i see it
i mean
i definitely will
just p4 being over made me kinda emotional
even on the bus ride to the grocery store after
now that i finished p4 who was your favorite p4 character
mine was probably naoto or yukiko
also honorable mention to hisano
oh yea also nanako
ignoring main cast probably my favorite sl in the game
is it bad that i actually really liked rises story and especially her rank 11
why did they have to make her horny shes such an interesting character
is there any really sad sls in p3
hisanos was pretty sad but bittersweet towards the end and it was nice to see her on 3/20
sayoko was also a good sl towards the end
she wasnt a pedo she was just depressed
why do good games have to have horrible fanbases
undertale, oneshot, pissowner and many more i cba to list
surprised me how normal and nice subnautica community is
its funny because
normal bb subreddits were often more retarded than okbc
wait how do they summon pissowners in p5
in p4 its destroying a card in p3 its killing yourself.
oh do they just
take those off
why is p3s so brutal then
so its like you felt like you shot yourself but didnt die
each time you perform an attakc
how are these mfs mentally stable???
how does aigis summon her pissowner
thats so cute
can u bring the dog into fights
thatd be silly
does he have a sl
imma rewatch the intro
its so good
i like p4s simple style but DAMN this shit on another level
i see why its 70$ now
also is p5 on the same level of insanely good graphics
i cant wait to watch 800 1 hour videos analyzing the artstyle of the game when i finish it
also p3 looks like it has a smaller cast than p4 and p5
is that true
just a suspicion i had
anyway your "flawed masterpiece" bullshit actually applies to p4
it has many flaws but DAMN its still so good
idk who koromaru or shinjiro are
shinjiro?
is that the guy with unfunny jokes?
why he look homeless
you sound like archie rn
"ermmmm dont look up ark spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
yea true
I GOT CALLED ADACHI KUN LMFAO
?
why
being named george floyd in p4
led to so many funny moments
also yukari and mitsuru both seem
sane
a far cry from p4
when does it first happen
hater on what
why makoto
noone was a hater on yu in p4
why mitsuru
arent htey supposed to be friends
is this why okbp keeps calling her a """girlboss"""
why is she a hater
mostly yukari
wtf is an evoker
yea ik?
okbp calls yukari a girlboss
when do i unlock yukari sl
GG
IM WATCHING THAT TMR

NOW STEP 2 ILL MAKE THEM PLAY PERSONA
wym
i want them to have p4 uniforms!!!
also i checked some reviews for dlc
its only getting shit on because of the price and not being included in the base game like it was in original p3
everyone says that besides that its great
money isnt an issue for me so i think ill be getting it after p3 before i do p5
IMAGINE
how so
what about like mid november
thats prob when id be done with p5
every review is just this
i do not give a fuck about shitty business practices i just want more pissowner to play!

if i find it
how can i get pq and pq2 on it
whens autumn sale btw
lets buy it then
thats prob when id be done with p5
perfect timing lol
how much are both to complete
"p4au" has adachi
which weird persona spinoffs are actually CANON
how did they revive makoter
are we having a stroke
p4 october is FILLER!
whats p3 october like
.
p5?
whats the best month of p3 btw
p4 imo was january what do u think
never more being the worst out of the 3 ending songs does not make it not one of the BEST persona songs
its very fitting for what game p4 was
the ending was so nice
when was p3r announced
OK SO
SURELY WE GET A
PERSONA 4 REMAKE ANNOUNCEMENT SOON

*fat white guy with a weird beard
i fucking hate that this sentence is 100% true
its the best way to describe it
yes it has flaws but those flaws arent any reason you shouldnt play it
its still so good
oh yea anything i couldve missed on my playthrough?
"better days" for me its kinda nostalgic but also similar to current irl??
mostly because i moved to pexico, bavaria
lmao WHAT

WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT
@ZeldaLord WOULDNT IT BE FUNNY IF I
BOUGHT AN ADACHI TIE
oh god
zelda
theres so many fucking comics of this shit what the fuck???
anyway
imma go watch p4 videos
THE FUCK????
YES
are they in serbian too
.
6 FUCKING PAGES OF ADACHI X YU GAY PORN COMICS
(dw i just scrolled all the way down and didnt see anything
per
so
na
bro why is the serbian language so silly
i would die pronouncing this shit 💀
the color
find a white one
i just saw lol
was abt to sendu
this is under the faggot persona 4 vid
and its so true
did that person play the fucking game????
media literacy is actually dead
oh yea
it starts the video by talking how it got into persona by some fan comic
soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
its so similar
put the entire p3 ost there
@ZeldaLord NAOTOS CHARACTER IS TRANSPHOBIA
"NAOTO SHOULDVE BEEN TRANS"
zelda you know all those times naoto talks about accepting herself and not changing for others
nah shes just trans and in denial!
reading comprehension in 2024
you did not play the game, random internet gay person
naoto would NOT like it if you called her trans
thats invalidating her character arc
she was one of the best sls and people just say "nah shes trans"
@ZeldaLord THE GAY PERSON IS TALKING ABOUT NAOTO WITH NEUTRAL PRONOUNS
LMFAO
@ZeldaLord BRO
YK THE NAOTO LABORATORY THING IN HER DUNGEON
THE GAY PERSON SAID ITS A FUCKING GENDER REASSIGNMENT PROCEDURE
the gay person took naoto not caring about what gender people see her as but for her abilities as the fact shes trans
media literacy is dead and gay people killed it
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO
whatever this means ig?
whats 2500 din
its making fun of the line that is literally true
does this mean retro in serbian
how the fuck
do you spell that
it sounds like cancer to say
NAH IM FUCKING DEAD
he looks so emo
she looks like she has downs
she looks like a 2008 emo girl
"naoto hates being a woman" @ZeldaLord DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A MAN TO YOU
@ZeldaLord it devolved into cope "why did they immediately start calling naoto a she when it was revealed shes a woman why is it not like that when someone changes their gender"
he was blind for a bit
ignore
the slur
ZELDA
THE GAY PERSON JUST SAID
NAOTO IS "DIET GAY" FOR KANJI
IM FUCKING DYING
i paused it too many times
because i hate it
how many mins are u in
OH YEA A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT A YOSUKE ROMANCE FOR SOME REASON?????
in okbp mostly
LOL
i identify as cabbage
or
was browsing okbp 24/7 and thought it counted as playing the game
i mean
not even joking the similarities ARE there
oh mb
headphones on bus
all osts downloaded
bus is the train
goes to big school in the city
17 like makoto
probably same height
maybe same eyes and hair?
arent you 180cm
makoto looks like hes 180cm
what color are your eyes zelda
i perfected it
daily life of a miserable waffle
GGGGGGG
zelda, this is the problem
naoto being trans as a trans man myself is so important to **ME**
this is not their fantasies that they could relate to these are characters written with very different arcs
find an actual canonically trans male character to relate to im sure theres many dont insert headcanons into others
zelda
im going to make
the most elaborate rot schizopost in all of pj
ill give you a slight nod to what it is
every pj member will be assigned an arcana.
im gonna write pj social links
@ZeldaLord

just got out of the shower to go play persona only to realize i have to go to the bus
fuck everything
...
im like peak misery since 2021 rn
i really am playing p3 at the wrong time
arent i
schoolpex
how did he
show
DID HE
GG IM SO COOKED
i got into it like that too
so i buy the answer rn...
guy behind me giggling "bussy" guy next to me saying fein the entire class
premium bavaria education experience
you must
under NO circumstances tell pixel about this
understood?
NO CIRCUMSTANCES
persona 3 shirt (like the p3 artstyle) probably not official on some short emo bitch a bit away from outside school.
prob not from my school but horrifying
i was in shock
anyway
this means
bavaria has at least one persona fan.
potentially two because
the makoto headphone guy
is the demographic for persona 3 just
depressed 16 year old white girls
when i saw that
i felt like i was in 2008 or something
forgot to answer
its just
makoto
and a lot of blue
what
@ZeldaLord ive infected hypixel dupers with pex
are you proud of me
KYS
?????
im done
i didnt think i could get more miserable
yet here we are
if i hear a single new french word
im just replaying p4 and subnautica
im too miserable to play p3 rn i think
p4 is like happy game
IN NO OTHER GAME
HAVE I SEEN FRANCE
yes thats why
i dont want to get ti the misery
misrry is prob november
like p4
do i just
put junpei in team
fuck yukari

depression inducing
makes it one of the most miserable games from then on
made them cry for hours

3 days zero bait
history
holy shit getting to agree with this retard on anything is impossible
how do i gaslight him into thinking what he found on mcirosoft isnt my real name so i can remove him
THINKING ABOUT HAPPIER THINGS WONT GASLIGHT HIM
how could i fix it
do i remove the email and add another one with same first 2 letters and show him the full name
i mean its not that bad
idt hes stupid enough to actually do it unless i kicked him off
hes well aware i have ALL his personal info and could even call his parents or school if i cared enough
do unprovoked he wont do shit
@ZeldaLord it might sound bad but just THINK of how funny it is
you know how it was very comedical when you cuck rise?
i rrally wanna finish this ark map (like 30h at most) and go to archie favorite map just to cuck him
hr would probably hang himself
he has clips from ark where i say shit on the level of premium pixellian bait in the most dead sleep deprived miserable voice possible
this is worse than name
my voice has this signature
miserableness
idk why im not even miserable
my voice just always sounds dead even when i laugh
THERES LITERALLY CLIPS WHERE IM CELEBRATING SHIT AND ITS STILL MONOTONE
IM NTO MISERABLE
ok Andrei Yuki
hes not in the mitsuru gooncave i checked mutuals
yeah i posted the "mitsy" emoji
he is baiting, zelda
ill prob leave this is like the
third tier pissowner of okbp
i keep gettinf the welcome stickers
im a mitsuru cult microcelebrity
this is my life.
i wanna sleep but
this fucking tea is too hot to drink
if i get on twitter for that
well
funnily enough
bavaria shack has a shotgun
(america)
SHOW
oh
that seemed like
cheap bait
.
discors account deletion v2
its funny because
everyone thought i deleted the account because "le ohd incident"
when infact i did
because thr wrong people

its people finding out i was le hypixel gooner
god is dead and mitsuru gooncave killed him
answered what
yes.
are we ignoeing the 922 things weong with this image
4 results some makoto pfp

WHICH MAY THE HEARTS AND SOULS OF LIFE

NOONE SHOULD NEED A PERMIT TO WAY OF LIFE
NO MATTER HOW FAR

HOW SHORT IT MAY LAST
VENTURE LIFE BURN YOUR DREADD
it is very plausible that whatever divine creator of humanity if there is one would abandon it and be ashamed of it upon seeing that it has created that discord server
dont let your curiousity get the best of you
do not join
gonna stop fucking asking now????
you dont want to know, zelda
nah lurking
lies
i never sent him any fanfic lmfao
@ZeldaLord obv dont tell pixel ANY of this
but what the FUCK went wrong in my life for me to be considering buying some modern mp3 player with all p3 p4 p5 osts
i wanna look into mp3 players
and buy one
and use it
and have only pissowner on it
is this what no ark does to someone?
prob smt that works with airpods

rn like
300 smt?
"work with that"
i am NOT project irl makoto zelda
i just want an mp3 player
i dont want to be makoto
is that time consuming
i do not have much time recently
tighter schedule than akechis butthole
less time than building a pc?
holy shit finding the japanese green beans in bavaria is harder than finding a person whos both straight and not attracted to minors on okbp
edamame WHATEVER
the thing is they dont exist in bavaria
kmssss
can i get that irl?
ok
u sure i can put
all main p3 p4 p5 osts

anyway
cest rendezvous oui magnifique

he needs some "private lessons" with architecthor
:freaky:
now excuse me ill go shoot myself for that
for me its like
the opposite
i kinda struggle w writing but i can actually communicate with people in actual important situations (buying shit)
THATS A KILLING YOURSELF REFERENCE
STUPID!
au revoir
idk what that means

@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord
OKBP FLAIR "OCTOBER IS ROBOSEXUAL PRIDE MONTH"
theyre horny for aigis and some black aigis
@ZeldaLord what does "girlfailure" mean
everyone is calling mitsuru that
would much appreciate it if u showed me ur pissowners from sept
mitsuru is like the sanest and coolest person what
august?
@ZeldaLord apparently fes answer is more depressing than p3r answer
do i get it?
i meant in the same way as naoto
just one of the most well written characters that you really are interested in their story and conclusion
wdym
part of sl i assume
oh yea i can start yukari and fuuker soon :D
i really feel like i can do all sls legit
current pace is great
what in sept
how is that simp
its the same as with a fucking tv show character
can you not appreciate a character and its writing and be interested in their backround and conclusion if its a female character???
@ZeldaLord is this a spoiler
i saw it in a okbp comment
what the fuck
am i a hisano simp because shes my one of my favorite p4 characters close to favorite and by far favorite sl (tied with naoto)?
asked rn
@ZeldaLord yk that guy who commented on my post and under ur comment?
from 23 days ago: ||"makoto has canonically a big ass dick so it actually doubles as an evoker, so yes"||
@ZeldaLord yk the yukari circumcision scar meme?
autism
where is burn my dread in p4 zeldalord
below it is an image which is proof
yea
me and archi often get temporarily blocked by people for the shit we send
@ZeldaLord theres france in the vanya presentation (rouge)
i cant escape from france

better name
+ helps me spread the rot
@ZeldaLord
p5 subreddit
hm which one?
any hint?
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord
OWNER OF KUUDRA GANG STATEMENT
the dog is depressed because the monk died
is there a single normal person
makoto parents dead
mitsuru guilt complex
aigis makoto die :(
yukari retarded dad
shinjiro akihiko ken WHATEVER THE FUCK HAPPENED 2 YEARS AGO (kens mom died because shinjiro stupid i think)
fuuker parents and bullied for 2 days
koromaru monk die
are the visuals of aigis being completely broken and wandering around in the op just for cool visuals or actual story
they really made it seem aigis has been sitting in a lab for 10 years right after creation
on that bridge
then all the arcana cards
she falls to her knees
thats why i assumed she was walking
anyway zelda
i figured out what happens on 10/4
yk that ikutsuki and mitsurus dad with guns image
where the backround is ALL OF SEES **CRUCIFIED**
probably what happens
idfk how they get out of it tho
nah i just like to make schizo theories
my ark theories were even more brain damage than my persona ones
anyway rn my main motivator is
finding out what the fuck is that scene
gejuinely ZERO clue whatsoeve
is that 10/4
you and pixel mention it when 10/4 is brought up
bro im scared
imaigne its juet nyx killing the 3 bad guys
yk how p4 adds marie and p5 adds kasumi?
the p3r 3 antagonists look SO filler
f?
his stupid characyer
anyway
ikutsuki is weird
but why is mitsurus dad there
holy shit p3r is
so interesting
really makes you wanna know more
@ZeldaLord if you liked how p3 has mysteries and shit you will love attack on titan
are there any important characters not introduced yet
who
bruh
gn
acrually
WHAT THE FUCK
I EXPECTED KIRYU MAKOTO
wait WHAT THE FUCK
HOW DID HE GET THAT
TGATS DEFO FROM THE SERVER
sorry to say but yeah..
he genuinely reads that shit.
this is how pj dies
anyways i wanna bw all the time now its so fun
can pixel stop gooning
we couldve had peak
either pixel will slowly reveal it to you or youll never know
im not taking any part in this shit
the things ive seen are already enough
pixel joining this server
is like hitler being given nukes
mostly read
if i saw any images i wouldve stabbed my eyes out
why are you so curious holy shit
its just a ton of shipping and fanfics
here you go
vanya is normal outside of the rot episodes we did to you dw
on the sanity scale shes like 2 levels more sane than me and archie
sanity scale is uh
10 pixel and mitsy cult 8 me and archi 6 vanya 5 spooky 4 carrot 1 zeldalord and ceranius
uhh kinda
oh yea forgot neand
hed be like 7 or 8
nah dw i was baiting i have no messages
pixel does tho
zero involvement
uh
only join msg too
yea
we both never talk there dw
now stop asking
OH YOU THINK???
WHAT EVER COULD POSSIBLY MAKE YOU THINK OF SUCH AN OBSERVATION
nah he just randomly got it on okbp
the kiryu makoto message was a coincidence
anyway all ill say is
theres like 3 channels for character models lmfao
i have good and bad news
well its
both bad news for you
bad news 1 the models exist
bad news 2 i got spoiled that aigis is a wild card through an art of models
oh i thought it was a major lore thing
because aigis is surrounded by all arcana cards in the op
is it not some direct continuation
from the ending
is it same bridge where fentanyl jesus killed the slime shado
is the plot not
everyone grieving and wanting to bring back makoter
which day
when makoto die?
als
FELLA
boringgggggg
i prefer having 1 pissowner
ok then
find me your september pissowners
august
combat is trial and error
fusing is trial and error which costs ten trillion money

FOOT FETISH BAIT ON REDDIT HOMEPAGE

i didnt use it

pre hermit fight even
is this a dead run
YOU KNOW THAT ONE REALLY POPULAR JAPAN SONG ABOUT SUICIDE??
yea but that one has like 400m views on yt and 600m plays on spotify
someone made this adachi edit
anyway it just pr oves
that
fucking ADACHI is everywhere
夜に駆ける
YOASOBI · THE BOOK · Song · 2021
this one
imagine adachi singing it
you were gone for the first time in months so i spammed pixel with shumitsu art
ill delete it all rq and tell u when its gone
its just google search results tho nothing nsfw
may god bless your poor soul
i could easily beat it but im not stooping that low
ig ill prove you wrong later today
if youre that syre
twitter is 1000x worse than the server
"had them ready"
its first results
HOW WOULD HE RECOGNIZE THAT LMFAO
i call bait
no shit????
ive only sent heavily cropped porn 2 times
and a few uncropped spoilered ones to pixel because i fucking hate pixel
theres an nsfw role in the server apparently
so
yea all this shit and the mitsuru outfit ruined mitsuru for me
i mean it didnt work for kanji and naoto
maybe itll end when i see more of mitsurus story
at the start zelda
then when i played the entire game
i slowly realized
i hope itll be same for the p3 characters
this was during the game
for yosuke kanji naoto it was fine after i finished the game
yosuke: constantly makes fun of kanji for the gay dungeon
okbp: yu and yosuke are the best gay couple p4r NEEDS a romance for yosuke
when i did kanji and naoto sl it was when i actually began to like the characters a lot
i thought shinji and akihiko were gay (reddit rabbit hole) but no theyre just both suffering from a ton of trauma
ITS IN A GUARDIAN FLOOR CHEST
same for yukari
p3r characters hit hard
i want to see more of the mitsuru shit that was in july
it was really intereating
estranging herself from her family and the guilt of whatever the fuck happened in the original sees
i really feel like
theres some buildup
to all of the shit from 2y ago
all colliding at somep oint
is that 10/4
do i replay 3-4h and a boss
to not throw away 4 days of fatty sl
only 2 were actual rabbitholrs
other 4 were just okbp posts
kanji and naoto
only went into those rabbitholes
after finishing the game
because i wanted to see the thought process
and the conclusion i came to is that the lgbt non binary 16 year old white girls have too much free time to spend on headcanons
basically
female to male trans people
made headcanons about naoto being trans
and everyone picked up on it
(it couldnt be more wrong to her character(
yes representation or whatever but naoto becoming trans would literally be her falling back into needing to present as male to not be viewed and treated differently
its so wrong
kanji
they act like hes gay or bisexual (him being gay in his dungeon was cope because he was afraid of being rejected by anyone and not even in a romantic situation)
and im not even gonna comment on people calling him gay because of his sl him making those toys (they missed the whole fucking point of his character)
which one
yosuke
i have genuinely no fucking idea why anyone calls him gay
and ive never looked into it and never will
akihiko and shinjiro
people make ship art
(they are traumatised orphans both with huge amounts of guilt)
mitsuru.
THEY REDUCE HER CHARACTER TO A SOFT WEAK BITCH WHO RELIES ON MAKOTO FOR EVERYTHING
i opened the fanfic channel like 3 times
but it was always just making her a blank character
to insert headcanons into
??????
oh thats fucked up
thats quite fucked up
i thought elizabeth quest items were filler dialogue
do you like my school dialogue skipping btw
its a parallel to how much i give a fuck about biology
test on thursday btw!
thats all the charavters
stereotype "needs to rely on her man for everything"
anyway im very surprised how mitsuru is the sanest in sees
the p3p poster made me think shed be yukaris bully or something
she just gives off that vibe in p3p
the uh
thing on the thing
soul phrase
yes seeing that was so fucking funny
soul phrase youtube thumbnsil with characters
this holy shit
stereotype emo rich girl bully
yea
they do
oh yea i read
on le wiki by accident
i can revive chidori if i do 2 more junpei sls and buy some flowers
so if i replay 3h for the odd morsel to do fatty i could theoretically do it
oh
ill just do it on another svae
oh gg
no shit it was to get screenshots for you??
you asked me zelda do you not remember
im only at the end of september but i already know ill be depressed when he dies and the game ends
starting p5 immediately the same day will make it better right

10 years in the joint zelda
the entire point is tha
when youre gone
you dont look
i swear to fucking god
i guess you were right
i met an old classmate and he said i "look miserable"
is this the effect of playing persona???
how will it be after 10/4???
will i kill myself
im about to go play it rn
no why did you leave hte game
we couldve had peak but you gooned
the entire history of the gc
actually now that i say it like this
theres blackmail on all of us in that gc
its better gone
@ZeldaLord would ben goon to persona if i got him into persona
actual question
not bait
i wanna shill it to him but i dont want him gooning to the characters
we all left after you did
we couldv ehad
old pjbw
but you GOONED
even 1 game
we havent had pjbw
since mid august
do you know how long that is
nigga i have a test tmr
we need a new 4th
who doesnt GOON
is it bad that im just
playing on the september 22nd save rn
to get to 10/4
then replay all of it
because im too lazy to replay the 1h first
why is it a fucking odd morsel
is it possible to finish all sls
even if i dont do fatass at all during that vacation
its only 3 days anyway
FUCKING ODD MORSEL
oh if i
did 10/4 on that save
and replayed
id have to do tartarus again too
so yea i cant
infinite cycle of
log on p3 -> fuck hermit fight it takes years -> go to bed
send me the brainrot i posted in pins
i need to save it somewhere
thats france
die
we were there for a bit after
but you were dead
archie is on osu
what pissowner song
do i make him do
if some
psychologist saw that shit
what would they think
ss it all
yes
why
this is the extremely transphobic extremely racist manipulates everyone genuine pathological duper and RATTER hes talking about btw @ZeldaLord
diana is miserable
im gonna play p3r after i do hw
infinite cycle of "dont have time to do p3r or any game i have to study biology" -> doesnt study -> go to bed
HOW
thats just unproductivity from adhd
yea but isnt the main thing about depression being sad
bro im fucking irl akihiko the dry chicken eater
adhd meds have all sorts of side effects
like getting fat
nty
if i became fat
i would be depressed
rn im just tired
so no reason
i mean it doesnt limit me from much
i still go to school study enough workout
more of an inconvenience really
@ZeldaLord vanya made her friend play kimi no kioku on osu
i just read scorched earth and now i want to p3r myself
just realized mitsuru says tres bien
in her theurgy
nah
she says "childs play" too
id win
first try and it went so smoothly
and everyone was alive too
unlike last time when it was just makoto
why did shinji not get xp huh?
he was on 7 hp
oh ig
YESS
@ZeldaLord surely you remember the table right?
i just have auto on everyone dead until last turn and waiting
(null light pissowner tr tr tr)

aigis: "magnifique as they say" AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
LMAO HE LOOKS SO GOOFY IN A TUXEDO
shinjiro is such a silly goober
no other words can i say to this fucking fatass than the hard r
but its done. finally.
@ZeldaLord FUSION ACCIDENT FUSING FOR MOON KILL ME
JUST KILL ME
shinjiro watching a cooking show with koromaru then pretending he was asleep was so cute
i love koromaru hes so cute
also im really interested in shinjiros character arc
hes slowly opening up to others more not isolating himself after the whatever it was incident
this is like when i started getting attached to the p4 cast all over again
also really interested in mitsuru and akihiko
also ikutsuki reveal but thats in a while prob
this is so peak
rank 6 akinari is genuinely so depressing
he finally talked about the story

amadas scream and koromarus howl
what the fuck
genuinely what the fuck
nah
the scene with akihiko the day after
i have
no words
its not anything weird zelda
pixel will just kill himself
both in the ship are the same age thats all you need to know
its not joker and his teacher or something like that
you wouldnt really care
its not nearly as bad as kiryu makoto
its just spam of a ship ar
with "surprise" i just meant that i wont tell you which ship
@ZeldaLord if i tell you what it is will you add me back so i can post it
yes thats the point
add me so i can post it
ill cover it up with gifs/delete it when youre back just dm me
they are same age i checked
go on offline
im
fucking
done
im never posting ship art again
SOMEHOW i found YU X NANAKO with this
what the fuck
who makes that
what in the actual fuck
kill me
im going to fucking kill myself
i fucking hate everything
all persona fans are degenerate pedophiles
i want to kill myself
its not bait
you can look for it
this is not something id fucking joke with
theyre all media illiterate pedophiles genuinely what the fuck
okbp
makes pedo """jokes""" way too much
ill find new bait
i dont want to risk this again
where can i get the stupid doll
creepy doll
are ryoji and pharos same va
it kinda feels like it
this could either be
1. cheaping out
2. death arcana is change and pharos is now ryoji and his role as pharos is complete and he needs to be ryoji for this new chapter of p3r where i dont even fucking know what the goal is anymore
fucking niggers
oh this song
this song is used as a sample on a really good song
why is it actually good?
zelda
do i buy it
my pc case is white
and has blue lights
is it official or fanmade
if its john atlus certified ill buy it
is this john atlus certified
if it is ill buy it
so if i bought it

its my favorite aesthetic colors and matches my case and i love pissowner three
@ZeldaLord im sorry but i have to
yea
oh right

but let me cook
MORE EVIDENCE
1
fucking
hour of
fusions
its fusing
when it happened other times i instantly redid it
there is nothing to skip in fusion menu
and elizabeth talking
yes thats the only thing you can skip
oh i am NOT redoing tartarus missing people
it took like half an hour
and i got no rewards for it anyway
how do i disable
the fucking
sound ingame
@ZeldaLord do i need good pissowners rn for next tartarus or can i just do the fusion requests
what monitor do you have
i need a fucking monitor that doesnt turn off
it
screen turns black
sound disappears too
mouse and keyboard lights dont turn off
could it be related to the
very casual
screen tearing during p3r
wtf is it then
where
oh it wasnt in graphics
so wtf could be the fucking monitor going black
does dark zone have a increased chance of reaper
i was on the floro for like 30s and a reaper spawned
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord
ZELDA YOU NIGGER
MY FUCKING PC
IS FUCKED
I WAS CASUALLY DOING TARTARIS
AND MY MONITOR GOES BLACK
MAKING SOME DEMONIC SOUND
SOUND AND EVERYTHING STILL WORKING AND I MADE SURE I CAN RUN AND HIT SHIT IN P3
AND THEN IT MAKES MORE DEMONIC NOISES UNTIL THE ENTIRE FUCKING PC RESETS
no i was not blaming you im just saying slurs because im losing it
so does this prove its the monitors fault
@ZeldaLord ok im in the shit
can you help
there is tens of these

with what
the pc or p3r
all crashes were while i was playing p3r
never when i played goonblock or watched yt
@ZeldaLord i opened p3r after tabbing and it made weird pc noises
aigis: ryoji is dangerous
could it be less obvious
so was i right or was i right?

THATS WHY HELL BE ABLE TO SEAL NYX ON THE 31ST
WHAT THE FUCK
FLOCHFORSTER SCHIZOPHRENIA BECOMES TRUE
can you add me back to gc why did you even remove me fucktard
these classes are so repetitive
i found the best pixellian bait
did pixel summon his persona yet
i cba to spam more its annoying on phone
@ZeldaLord did i do a good job
of the bait you mentioned earlier
yea?
oh.
which one
where is it
ah
yea send
also the game genuinely became
peak since 10/4
like i love p4 and its hard to compare them but
this is genuine peak in every sense of the word
oh yea
why is everything with like this grayish tint
even inside the dorm
is this the fog of p4?
oh yea
shpuld i split tartarus into 3 nights
i have 3 blocks to clear and all monads
i cant do it all at one time
does it
have
9
fucking
bosses
how can you do that
zelda
bosses exist before, yk?
sp is the problem
you said theres no save editor
mitsuru sl rank 10
"She sees a happy future together with me"
one thing zelda
when does the game tell you you will die?
it really wouldnt make sense to have all this if you die only at the end
itd be way more impactful if you do the entire epilogue knowing it
...including talking to all your sls
show
nah i just wanna see the crashout
also how can i get weapons for aigis
i wanna main aigis
for most fights i can use her in
truly tragic how ark is dead and uninstalled
and my only future is becoming a persona faggot
weve reached the point where im thinking of how to get the keycaps
surely post office...
i am bored
explain what i should know for january and finishing tartarus
also fusions
zelda
we had the english """"native"""" speaker from kenya again :(
"in kenya we" KENYA GO BACK TO THE FUCKING FIELDS
5 more hours of yapology filler
dont look for like 30s i need to say something
stop crashibf out
i need to yap SOMEWHERE
sude we hust call yiy makoti
rhatsnoteven sgopiibg
we just call u nakoro
gcgh
duck neyvoard
how do people know??
why is pixel sexually harassing me for the past 30 minutes
he is a week older its grooming
yes
no
i was dealing with france's crying over his boyfriend who hates him
show
hey i dont have a long attention span @ZeldaLord
i wanna tab already
WHAT
WHO
i wont contact them
you can uh
send kuudra gang owner screenshots of me saying slurs
if you
want
just
show me
oh
beanie?
please tell me
you have a ton of blackmail on me anyway i wont do shit
i just want to know who is degenerate enough
ok so its one of these
wym dont
DO YOU THINK I WANT TO INVOLVE MYSELF WITH A FAGGOT LIKE THAT LMFAO???
youre funny
EGYPT DUNGEON WHAT
IS THAT WHY HE WANTS P5R
IS THIS HIS "REPRESENTATION"
so whats the main server
they are in
not nomi or gtceu
i want a server with a lot of messages
so i can check for pissowner keywords
tr
tr
tr
nigga.
im just about to take a 1h nap
why rn
i dont feel like doing anything else
shut up
i already studied today
and will later on
is the crashout over
you do realize its for the SCREENSHOT
idfk what the other word is
hey i want the stream
HEY
FUCKING ADD ME
RIGHT NOW
I NEED THE STREAM
IT LITERALLY IS "MAKOTO YUKI" YO URETARD
@ZeldaLord FUCKING
AD
DYES
YES
?????
LMFAO
what the fuck
you are too far gone
introducing pj to persona would be harmful schizophrenia
benny would genuinely start gooning to persona characters
and that shoulsnt be a real or ideal reality
theres kiryu makoto model in that fucking server btw
official ones?
looks pretty accurate
???
why is it jus tonline btw
whered u find it
is p5 worse graphics than p3
faces on models look like uh
????? what am i looking at????
how worse
oh yeah @ZeldaLord
you know that persona schizo in kuudra gang?
i think i heard """battle hymn of the soul""" in one of his videos he posted
does it sample the vocal part of aria of the soul by any chance?
thats all i really remember and im glad because i wanna experience it in the game
what i heard was
basically rap over a sample of aria of the souls vocal part
and it was fire
is it that
is burn my dread last battle ver in the game or just from fes or portable and they made a reload ver
not this one but
is this in p3r too
is this real
no is the song real you retard
it is so peak
genuine peak
wouldve been better if that was in the original version too
but still peak
how many osts does
nyx fight have
battle hymn of the soul and burn my dread final battle ver?
is the 2nd jin and takaya fight
an actual good boss theme
or doodoo like the bridge one
oh yea zelda which was your favorite game for osts
i just watched
p3r bad ending
wow is that fucked
the main fucking thing is
that theres nothing shown explicitly bad from the choice
neither does it show the outcome of the fall and everyone dying
it just shows how all the memories theyve had and all the character development is gone
11 months since april yet its all the same
and aigis cant do anything but watch them all like that
not remembering anything
and she doesnt show up to the graduation which implies shes probably preparing to fight nyx and that that day is the fall
it just hurts to watch
zelda
p3r stream rn
i just started adamah
lore reason as to why junpei is so fucking bad???
his theurgy does like 150 damage
both
do you regen sp inbetween the jin takaya and nyx fights
@ZeldaLord overseers of light are making me quit the game
2 turns each every fucking 2 of my turns
masukukaja and masukunda and they still rape my weaknesses
like i am done with the game nty
@ZeldaLord i fucking won
it was the most bs fight ever
i ended it in a single turn because i rsd until concentrate on fuker and then just used all theurgies
whats evej so bad about thwt video
its just a compilation of schizo drawings
not like you have to watch it
i dont even get the reference
does that reference some album cober or something
wait that made you crashout??
I LITERALLY POSTED THAT IN GC A FEW DAYS AGO
kanye west having the tower arcana makes
so much sense
idk half the references in the video im gonna be honest
WAIT WHY THE FUCK "Ren Amamiya"
this isnt a trend of nicknaming people as persona protagonists
you just have many similarities to makoto
i have none to joker
no?
hes too fucking fat to fit in anything
ok fine but
can you be clear about what you dont want posted before crashing out
wym
?????
ss proof?
im ikutsuki
"im the mf who wears shorts on 10c weather"
average egypt
you still have similarities to yu
isnt jonkler least miserable
yu is just like autistic and antisocial
why is that
ur acting like ive played the game
oh yeah isnt p5 intro 8 hours
why does he not just kill himself
thats more miserable than makoto
and makoto has dead parents
yu just got sent to bavaria, japan
LMA
also thinking about it
WHY IS P4 VELVET ROOM A CAR
p3 elevator makes sense and p5 cell makes sense
but the car makes ZERO sense
yea okbp
mobile takes a bit to delete
wym
?????
THATS THE FEMALE JOKER MOD WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT
nahhh wtf it spreads
im just starting to realize
persona is NOT a happy relaxing life sim
p4 was tho
i really hope p5 has shit like 10/4 and plot rapidly moving forward past a certain point (11/4)
and also actual high stakes and risks
thats akechis dad no?
so uh embarassing story but
when u were finishing p5 i wanted to play it
so i just looked up everything about it so id have no reason to
no i just looked up endgame shit
like yaldaboth stuff
and shido palace akechi death
you said its the opening
?
well i never heard ark
so iwont spoil it
oh yea is there any important days like 10/4 and 11/4 before nyx
do you think i can do first reaper with theurgy spam
with that i mean concentrate scarlet havoc with it critting
i just use siegfried for everything hes my main
brave blade concentrate agidyne then all other skills are just boosts for thr brave blade
doesnt that not matter
scarlet havoc is slash damage
do i just use some skill card on him for another boost
like apt pupil
also WHAT BUFFS ALMIGHTY DMG??
wym w that
does concentrate work on it or no
so for theurgy spams
do i do
akihiko matarunda/masukukaja
yukari theurgy
mitsuru concentrate makoto charge
akihiko theurgy yukari mediarama/masukunda mitsuru theurgy makoto theurgy
makoto
makoto
ok ig ill rakuna w mitsy and dekaja with makoto
oh yea
is final gatekeeper of tartarus an actual unique boss
or random shit like always
singing what
whats that
never heard
oh yea @ZeldaLord
how good is the song after kimi no kioku
because i literally cannot imagine something better than kimi no kioku memories of the city living with determination dorm arrangement and battle hymn of the soul
(havent listened to battle hymn of the soul dw just the part i heard)
@ZeldaLord hey can you help me find the full version of that battle hymn of the soul edit i sent you
idfk how to reverse image search audio
WAIT AN ACTUAL FULL VER EXISTS?
I MEANT JUST THAT VOCAL PART
Pinned a message.
REMIND ME TO LISTEN WHEN I FINISH THE GAME
THIS WILL BE THE PEAKEST OF PEAK
i keep finding persona in videos too
what even is p5t lmao
is it just money farm slop to capitalize off p5
p3r is like
one of the videogames ive ever played ngl

tell me the fucking song right now
@ZeldaLord HEY
FUCKING TELL ME
oh god
is there an adachi or akechi one tho
i still dk
was akinari dead the entire time or just rank 9-10
him being dead the entire time would make a lot of sense
was it confirmed or
if he can give you the notebook dead im pretty sure he can also write the story while dead
it makes much more sense for him to already be dead and still be searching for a meaning of life before hes truly able to let go so he makes the story to find his meaning and moves on
makes sense ig
considering
the fact he is extremely close to dying in rank 9
@ZeldaLord do you get to meet his spirit at the bench again on 3/5
yea he doesnt
also since akinari shit appears in p4
the thing is
how the fuck did the book get published
makoto literally DIES
and hes the only one who had it
i know
but makoto is never shown publishng it
i mean it ties into the entire meaning
the story being published not known by who would be the entire conclusion
someone in the dorm probably found it
i am expecting a
full context explanation of it in p4r
it is true tho
while i love p4 the p3 writing is just far better
@ZeldaLord would you happen to know if p4 was a downgrade from p3p or p3r an upgrade from p3p and p4g
i watched some videoessays on p3r and
P3P HAD THE AI BUT MANUAL WASNT AN OPTION???
it was a comparison between p3p p3fes and p3r
i saw nyx appear for like 1s skipped through a min and that was it
no other mention of it the entire vid
is the ai better than p4
did they a tually make that
oh lmao
@ZeldaLord whats a good excuse
to not play ark for the vacation
no shit i wont
i just need an excuse

@ZeldaLord insta heal on thanatos?
@ZeldaLord why is makot gaining zero xp
is xp split through party members
do i do battles with makoto only
to what
I GO TO ONE FLOOR AND 2 RARE SHADOWS WITH MAKOTO ONLY
YUM YUM YUM
IT IMMEDIATELY ESCAPED?
why is he so desperate for smp
im cooking up max helel
just wait and see
which persona did u use as ur support (auto mataru auto maraku auto masuku heat riser debilitate)
im also gonna make a max phys build on like asura
zelda im almost done making hypermax gooner builds
just need an auto rebellion card, a crit rape amp card and i need to dupe 3 cards
well thats everyone but telos
all theres left is a slash boost and a auto rebellion
then im hypermax
ill stream u my max builds tmr in nyx
i love shiva
i also made a pretty weird build - lucifer w inferno fire amp panta rhei diamond dust (then spell master enduring soul single target boost insta heal)
but it works really well and did like 1500 in a monad door boss without weakness or concentrate
rate this support thanatos for elizabeth
he was so hell to fuse
im aware
im not covering for EVERY weakness zelda
its rng what she hits you with
WAIT WHAT
yea ik
isnt it that she only uses megidolaon
if she hits that exact attack
which you null
so which fucking pissowners do people use for her?????????
OH OF COURSE
FUCKING TELOS
THE ONLY ONE I DONT HAVE YET
do you not use a starting persona with auto ma shit tho
what did you use
i made a messiah with dekunda dekaja auto mataru automaraku auto masuku and im missing auto rebellion still
@ZeldaLord do i not even get to use shiva and siegfried (they null light(
why not
lucifer is my elemental cooker (i changed thunder reign to fire amp)
(1.4k infernos without concentrate or weakness on last block)
(in a monad door)
i have this helel
repel ice because i used him a lot before doing elizabeth
i made an entire fucking set of hypermaxed pissowners for them to be useless?
well i wouldve made them anyway but thats shit design
why make the hardest boss locked to one and only the last pissowner
also how many school days are avaliable after 1/10?
i have 13 more ranks to finish (including aigis filler)
i need 3 more yukari ranks and 1 more kenji rank
i kinda need to go to tartarus like every night
also where do you have lucifer and phys pissowners
which pissowner was ur support one
oh yea remember when i said i wanted a maxed gooner build on thanatos?
i made the same one on satan
that is so poopoo
ever heard of focusing an entire build on siegfried around brave blade?
and same for shiva
ill show you my shiva its maxed
im getting same thing on siegfried but i need slash boost
im the skyblock player so i do
also show me your orpheus for elizabeth when i get telos
"play the game"
theres nothing to play anymore
my entire party is maxed
all my pissowners are maxed
im just grinding skill cards on floor 70-100
i need to see your telos tho because idfk how to use ONE PERSONA FOR THE ENTIRE BATTLE
how so
idfk anything about elizabeth
thats when shes under 10k hp
you need to do 20k hp before
doesnt she full heal
first time you get her to under 10k
isnt this a nice build
how many pissowners can i max stats of btw
@ZeldaLord uh help
with all my str and mag incenses i could BARELY get just shiva and helels st and ma stats to 99
how tf am i supposed to max everything
is it too late to start using it 1/10
i wanna 99
siegfried shiva helel satan lucifer
str for siegfried shiva mag for helel satan lucifer
and for telos i want 99 on all
whyyyyy
is there any way to buy mag 3 incenses
when i was looking on reddit a gooner had over 10 pissowners with ALL max stats
@ZeldaLord id literally win
did u use only telos btw
i have this (replacing null phys with auto rebellion)
oh yea i maxed my shiva :D
when i draw fortune at shrine its always 2 notes
is max i can get 2 points
now this is the part where i savescum until i get auto rebellion and slash boost in tartarus
where did you get auto rebellion btw
ew not hypermax
show me ur builds so i can laugh at them
i love these 2
then my 2 phys cookers
this guy exists ig
then the support one
and the buff one
do you use a lot of phys on elizabeth or no btw
what then
hang yourself
elizabeth should be pretty free IF I HAD TELOS
wym
im hypermaxed
zelda
i even maxed my equipment shit
is elizabeth hard enough that i wont be able to finish the game today
wrong fucking boost
she looks so off wtf
scrumptious slash boost
or not
wdym
how
@ZeldaLord do i replace diamond dust or panta rhei for fire boost
should i try get magic mastery on lucifer tr
?
ARE YOU FUCKING
PLEASE GIVE ME MY SLASH BOOST
IM ALMOST OUT OF FRAGMENTS
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand my pc killed itself
it always kills itself in tartarus never otherwise

ALSO WITH DEVIL TAROT CARD I GET 2 BLOODY BUTTONS PER REAPER
I CAN MAX EVERY FUCKING STAT ON EVERY FUCKING PISSOWNER
@ZeldaLord this is massive
hang yourself
auto rebellion this time
zelda you cant begin to fathom how long ive been grinding for slash boost and auto rebellion
its probably longer than your null strike
whatd you even need that for
that would probably taste good
kinda yeah
except the rice is drier because that kind of rice is unedible for me and i hate it
the cherry on top is it being in a plastic container
WHAT
pixellian bait dw
pixel hates these too right
???
wym "YES"
i hate you
im schizo about ip whjat do you not get
also i finished aigis sl
wheres the filler rank ?
i might even be able to do koromaru after all sls are finished
FUCK YOU
OK FINE
ILL JOIN TOMORROW
WHEN I IFNISH P3
die
so autism
THE FUCKING CAT
KENJI GAVE ME A CHOKER???
@ZeldaLord i finished koromaru le and all sls
i told you id win
oh yeah @ZeldaLord is it just well known that kirijo group is french
because the old man said "adieu" to mitsuru
the one from koromaru le
did you finish junpei le on your playthrough?
it IS possible to max all les and sls on one playthrough
i couldve done it if i knew about dating notes before you told me
so like where do i unlock messiah
im doing yukari rank 10 rn
on 1/27
yea
anyway i was shinjiro rank 2 and junpei rank 3 and im gonna have 3 days left
i couldve ALMOST done it
and EASILY done it if i knew about notes
oh gg
i mean shinjiro i couldve 100% done i have 3 days left
also before last exam week i wasted a day on mitsuru because you told me she has a filler rank (she didnt)
so i couldve had 4 DAYS left
wher eyou dont rank up
i did both mitsuru and aigis without a single filler rank between them
the only thing i didnt 100% was hangouts
im at 3/5 on 1/27
do you think its possible
p3 was WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY easier and less stressful than p4
p4 schedules were all over the place
p3 was organized
how hard is p5 without royal
with akechi?
shift boost 2.0
why not akechi lmao
would you beath me to death with a hammer if i played episode aigis not p5 after i finsih p3
it has an entire new soundtrack and theres aigis stuff
and shes one of my favorite characters
you need to add me for the nyx stream in like 2 minutes
oh
elizabeth.
so how long did it take you
OH SHIT TRUE
ok episode slop after p5
OH YEA
@ZeldaLord
EPISODE AIGIS WILL BE ON SALE
WHEN I FINISH P5
wdym
werent you gonna
is it really that shit
do i buy p3p then
i think i did
prob did
so how long did
elizabeth take
ill listne rn
WHY IS IT WRITTEN LIKE I USED TO THINK ITS PRONOUCNED
its fucking fire tho
does p3p have the thing p3fes does
where ur sls can break/reverse if u dont spend time with them and bitches get jealous
seems like a fun mechanic
how can i get fes
its a harder version of p3
ok so zelda i heard a TON of glazing of no direct commands and how it requires more skill and thinking on yt
the joke is she spams it in fes and always misses
in fes theres also
tiredness
and tartarus is way harder
the table which i literally afkd is the hardest boss in the entire game
zelda
it uses a instakill every 2nd move
who wouldnt cheese it?
orpheus telos.
no its called fusion spells
ill play smp and stop crying about ips tomorrow if you show me your telos
im not going for a gooner build either
i just need an elizabeth build
did you use it for the whole battle
does elizabeth have weaknesses
oh yeah @ZeldaLord do i get concentrate and heat riser
is this a good build
she SWITCHES PISSOWNERS
ok almighty build it is
now which of these do i swap out for ali dance?
.
yes i figured
im going for almighty since no weaknesses
@ZeldaLord
thats my only source of healing..
reddit goonbuilds told me to use it
the final builds
thats without lucifer blade btw
zelda do u want a face reveal
this is the polish schizo i mentioned like 2 times
whats the joke
anyway elizabeth fucking sucks
does beating her do anything except the accessory
oh i switched to normal during lovers bossfight
dont you remember?
u were on stream
fuck you have a memory
do you only use one theurgy in the entire fight btw
so which theurgy
the loki and susano o one or gamble for a crit with scarlet havoc
killing yourself
what do i swap for heat riser
ok @ZeldaLord what other pissowner do i get heat riser on
what also resists most shit
you were WRONG
she only megidolaons you if you if she hits that weakness
with this knowledge i will cook her in a single try
why the fuck would you lie about that
literally no reason to 💀
and i wouldve tested it the moment i fought her anyways
OK WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO HERE
@ZeldaLord NEED HELP
OH ENDURING SOUL DOESNT WORK WITH MULTIPLE PERSONAS I GUESS
WELL FUCK ELIZABETH IM DOING NYX
OH SHE FULL HEALED
YEAH IM DONE LOL
ADD ME FOR STREAM
ALSO TOMORROW ILL JOIN SMP
time to kill the evil fentanyl jesus
# OH.
is it fucking true that merciless on p5r makes you deal 3x damage on "elemental advantage" instead of 1.2x
who thought its a good idea to let you summon a persona with victory cry and neo cadenza at the start of the game
genuinely what the fuck
pex
OK FINE SORRY
I NEED SOMEWHERE TO YELL AT P5S STUPIDITY AT
OK
ILL RELIST THEM
ADD ME
you are literally makoto

you just go "whatever idc"
"that notice board hit me eh whatever ill just wait for miserable school to end and miserably go home to miserably play miserable persona"
go hit the nigger?
payback:
i thought they wouldnt care in serbia
here they dont
us was "MUH BULLYING BAD" tho
youre the type of guy in school to just
sit/stand around doing nothing either on phone or staring into nothing
and just being miserable
i mean
90% of the time
in school
you are on phone
do you interact with ANYONE in school
mc on phone fym
also brawl stars??? everyone here just plays that
yes it fucking sucks
still though
how are you not miserable if you just spend all the time on phone
i would kill myself if i had no human interaction for the 10 HOURS OF HELL
im only really on phone if im sitting with noone or a random
or during breaks where we move classes that are far away
arent you next to different people in like every class
in 1 class im next to weird turkish guy and normal people
in 1 class im next to just the other extremely weird turkish guy
in 1 class im next to the fat guy who is on discord 24/7
in 1 class im close enough to the homeless looking fat guy that i can fucking smell him

Disclaimer: I do not own the music used to create this mashup. They are owned by Shoji Meguro, Atlus and everyone else who worked on this. I want to use this ...

Battle for Everyone's Slams - Quad City DJs vs Shoji Meguro
mp3 may or may not act funny, shrug
picture:
this btw
its actually so good
where im stupid :(
also 309$????????????
zelda i know you are rich but this is stupid
i also have money and shit but id rather spend it on smt like a gym membership and new monitors
because my half broken 70$ headphgones i have no issue with
also yk, buying actual clothes
ZELDA ITS FUCKING HEADPHONES
what do they do so well that makes them 300$
.
you are
yet to answer
oh its bullshit
it doesnt even fucking matter for gameplay
hey zelda this pic isnt mine but
ik a guy whos had this for months and it works well
and my left headphone doenst work unless the headphone wire is in an extremely specific position but i make it work
(sometimes it leads to me getting strangled by the headphone wire)
anyway except my pc and phone my setups arent usually expensive
if i were to invest a lot of money into expensive pc setup, which parts of it matter most?
is an expensive keyboard really that useful?
like a 300$+ one
is it made out of adachis blood or something
i have one thats old as fuck
rn
for 40$
what good gaming keyboard should i get
also does hyperx pulsefire haste work for now
ive had it for a year and its rly good
idfk what rapid trigger is
tempting to do it ngl
ill have way too much money to spend after birthday
and i like the colors
so for now should i just get 2 good monitors and a working headset
no i want something wireless that doesnt start malfunctioning in 10 days
well then find me a headset that DOESNT DO THIS SHIT
(stock photo)
not at ALL actually
i can make a friend order basically anything for me unless im too ashamed to ask him to order it (so persona shti i cant)
why
i dont wanna have a seperate mic
actually i havent vcd in a while i dont really need a mic
i vc like once a week or something its useless to have
and none of you guys speak eitehr
wym leak sound
yea fuck no
if my parents see me play persona i might get disowned
or sent to some bavarian boarding school (even worse)
why do open backs exist
never seen headphones like that in my life.
i dont really care about headset or mic quality just
that it works is stable and doesnt break easily
thats it
whats diff between mechanical and membrane keyboard
so which do i get
im not sure which one is my current one
in the past 6 years or so im pretty sure ive spent over 500$+ on headphones
no its so fucked up and dirty
ill try find the design
THERES RICE IN IT WHAT THE FUCK
I SAW A RICE GRAIN
whats better for gaming
mechanical or memrbane
WELL WELL WELL WHAT DID I FUCKING FIND
dude
its so much like this "optical" thing
whats optical keyboard
wha the fuck
anwyay
which means
anyway keys are annoying to press and LOUD AS FUCK on thsi keyboard
what is it
yeah my keyboard fucking sucks
the keys are so far apart and they took so long to move down
found it
Trust Gaming TECLADO GXT 833 THADO METALICO COMPACTO ILUMINACION LE...
GXT 833 THADO
is thisbbad
?
it is??
miserable
find me a really good one
ill buy on the 6th
oh my god first three digits of pi
(kil me)
well i would prefer if the KEYS WERENT FUCKING 3 MILES AWAY FROM EACHOTHER
id have to buy that
wait like 2 weeks for it to arrive
then only after that order an actual one
do they have that in tech stores?
no like in normal city tech stores
i can go to like munich or belkland ig
how much shit is compatible with the p3r keycaps
if im buying a good keyboard its gonna be p3r
i can probably convince my friend i have no fucking idea what a "persona" is and only liked the colors
my friends alr know i like that color scheme a lot and the way i act irl would never make them suspect me liking shit like persona
whats the name
so i can find keyboards with that
so if its an actual brand its fine?
its so nice
oh FUCK i need a new chair
hear me out
i dont wanna fight
but if you insist
there will be consequences
SHUT UP
KYS!!
too much
zeldalord answer honestly your answer isnt going to anyone you know
what is your thoughts on kosovo as an independent country?
and of what importance do you believe serbia is on the scale of the balkans as a whole
rude to not answer btw
p3p?
maybe
akechi is my new gay crush after adachi
id put it in a jar
zelda is this my punishment for not hopping on???
this is how you look like irl
judging by how you never wanna say what you wear
its obviously persona
you are also a closeted persona fan
and dont want to admit the gcs main thing is persona
you also get an awful lot of persona recommendations
i get like a few a week you get multiple daily
do you really have the subs muted, zeldalord?
same but im following those
i have all BUT okbp muted
spoilers
false
i am not short, i am not fat, i do not have any facial hair, i do not have long hair at all and i would never in my life wear a hat because they look so fucking stupid
yeah kfc chicken with 67800 calories of seasoning
aka belk
isnt kfcs whole thing that they add 39432940 spices
i used to i dont anymore
because i need a lot of calories
(from healthy food tho ofc)
im still gonna make mostly protein focused meals ill just actually season them

P4 MUSIC
AT THE END OF A BATTLE
OMG
wait it plays the p4 enemy ambush theme when i ambush
am i doing smt wrong
why is
it so easy to get noticed
wtf
they notice you instantly
nahhh
how do you jump
nop
wym
how
1. im not short 
2. i dont wear glasses
3. i dont have long hair
4. i dont have anime posters
where can you see
ark
?
my hate for glasses is that i definitely need them but i dont want to get them
my eyesight is horrendous
but glasses look stupid so i just deal with it
when i need to
i can still see shit on the school boards
so when that becomes a problem ill get contacts
whats that
i mean its probably just genetics both my parents wear glasses
3y ago i did and it was fine
why the fuck do people wear glasses if that exists
is tofr the thing where you cant see shit from afar or from close up
also my slow dumbass brain just realized shiho wasnt just beat up that time but probably molested
i want to kill kamoshida
mona said he probably dies tho
so its fine
is it for
which one
man i opened medal and
omg ann is getting her pissowner
you said it
ere
here
THERE IS NO WAY
@ZeldaLord persona brain disease :(
(i started asking what notable event happens)
(then i realized it wasnt about persona 5)
thanks steam
but im not goonjamin stockcummer
and ur gonna spend 3900$ on it
idk
also does p5 have automatic sls
its fool and which other ones
magician is morgana
whos judgement
phantom thieves 2?
looks an awful lot like igor
the length
makes sense since fool is yafdbdsajkfnpjkelns
???
.
oh
so were just spoiling now
fuck you!
"p4 and 5"
is it soon
i see sae a lot
until november?
also zeldalord one
is pjlethal ever being revived
also zeldalord one
is the testimony rn
the one in november or after maruki
when do i unlock maruki sl btw
i saw adachi like 10 mins in
in p4
yeah im not even gonna
bullshit
i meant akechi zelda
akechi randomly walked by one day
also goth mommy doctor appeared
how old is
tae
its not a real question
its something you send to pixel
please
PLEASEEE
FINE ILL DO IT MYSELF
@ZeldaLord HE THREW SOMETHING AT MY FOREHEAD
THE TEACHER
???????????
the fuck
also where are the other people
where are makoto yusuke futaba
how do you gain points btw
stats
compared to p3 and p4 how hard are stats and all sls
p4 management was extremely annoying and stressful but i had like half of january free
and p3 management was organized and easier but i only had like 3d left free
p4 stats were HORRIBLE to get
JUNES
shut up
its a p4 reference
how long will it take benny to fail nnn
nah i havent gooned since start of last nnn
i dont intend to
i really hope p5 has a ton of p4 references
like p4 had with p3
whats the joke
RYOJI???
i need to get on his level of baiting
OK I FUCKING WONT
ILL MAKE NORMAL CURRY CHICKEN AND RICE
why did you remove me
when i was gone for 3 seconds
??
also
what about it??
what the fuck is the correlation
wqhat the fuck
so why did you remove me
i didnt even DO ANYTHING
i was uh in the city ok
you wouldnt want to remove me right
ok hear me out zelda
ill stop yelling at you and pixel for bad life choices
just add me back so i can yap somewhere that doesnt have stage 4 brain cancer
really depends on more info i dont have
do you mostly order shit or just cook at home
THEY MADE A PIXELATED ARK GAME
IS THIS ROBLOX ARK????
average steam review for ark
add me back
niger
look i cant hop on because im scared about ip
not my fault
p4 anime :fear:
that looks SO good but its heart attack speedrun
only time i tried using a vpn to connect to a server it went through it
and if architecthor could remember more than 4 digits i wouldve been killed and raped
whats that cakked
called
its like a normal portin of it
so like
im trying to find a tartarus in one day video
BUT THEYRE ALL MAKOTO ONLY???
dude idk but
solo combat is SO miserable
the characters bring so much life to the gameplay
THE MISERABLE FUCKING PUMPKIN
THEY CAN SPAWN WITH JACK O LANTERNS TOO BTW
P5 OST IN TARTARUS LOL
FIND ONE WITH A JACK O LANTERN
@ZeldaLord ???
HE HAS P5 OST IN TARTARUS AND IN BATTLE A NEW WORLD FOOL
i love p5 dlc
i can recreate p4 <333
i will eventually
just need some of the p4 nostalgia
HOW IS THIS THE REASON
YEA I THINK
beneath the mask is so good
@ZeldaLord HE JUST GOT THE ALMIGHTY IN A RANDOM SHADOW BATTLE
u mean the instrumental at night?
STILL NOT ENOUGH
when does beneath the mask play
its a ihnstrumental
that zombie is NOT pixel
you can get a jack o lantern one

THIS IS PEAK OKBP
idfk

what are those yellow shits
i hate when okbp says "adult woman fetish"
what the fuck does this mean
i played the game
i dont understand shit
yeah it shows vpn ip in browser console
anyway just before i sleep one question
how likely do you think it is france rats my account if i unadd him (i have dms off if not f added so basically block but not block) and trll him to fuck off and not talk to me unless its some very important shit regarding the account
zelda im very egotistical and greedy
i want my account to be rich
its literally becoming better than ever without me lifting a fingwr
also i cant really remove access since some of his own shit is on the account
so how likely
pjbwsmp tomorrow for real
can i speedrun edrag
oh also
i have to wake up in 4h - 4h 30
should i just stay up

The Battle For Everyone's Souls (Persona 3) -Triple Mix-
Here comes another mix from Persona 3! This combines the original version of The Battle for Everyone's Souls / Battle Hymn of the Soul with the the Reincarnation and live versions. Enjoy!
Disclaimer: I do not own the music used to create this mashup. They are owned by Shoji Meguro, Atlus and everyone else who worked on this. I want to use this ...
THERE IS NO FUCKING WAY
ok but
the nyx in the yt thing
is so fire
when you get your right fucking tree add me back im bored
oh
my
god
dm it to archie
rn
he hates persona and the college dropput is his favorite album
please
are you awake
this is actually good
i listened to it
anything missing?
dude its a funny title
anyway
any good songs missing?
tell me what to add
my favorite pissowner
im mostly using shuffle
and its the months when it played
from start to end
show
also i need more stuff from p5
but ill add that when i finish it
and as im playing it
anything missing from p3 and p4?
thats like peak
whats sunset bridge
is it a big spoiler song
ADNASJKN.NA
wait moonlight bridge sunset bridge
any correlation
anyway where is all the peak at
NO memories of you, NO the almighty, NO snowflakes, NO heaven, NO burn my dread
NO our light
NO i believe
and i could go on and on
oh is it im blind
the almighty tho?
also memories is really underrated and beatiful
also corridor
also memories of the city
is so peak
best overworld theme in any game
actually snowflakes exist
tied between those two
its peak but memories of the city with the entire ending shit and vibe of the game when it started
on 1/1 when i heard memories of the city and living with determination dorm arrangement
genuine peak
best game made
oh i should add that theme for when nyx descends
thats really good
i liked ameno no sagiri and izanami
but nyx is overseer levels
of epicness
?
there is
a village
at
the
base
fuck
wheres

why is it so expensive
NO TELOS????????
also no helel no satan no lucifer
anyways
only the answer mentions makoto as dead
and the answer is schizo bullshit which i never considered canon
therefore
makotos fate is left to your own interpretation
and my interpretation is that he is alive

i have too much of a life to know these terms ngl
yeah zelda
im the guy who didnt know how to make a folder on windows 11
what the fuck is an amplifier
i dont eat slop so idk what this shit is
bro ngl only someone who regularly eats shit like ice cream would know what an "amplifier" is
i bet pixel would know
im tired
do you think
i could learn to code
or am i far to oretarded
DISCOVER WEEKLY FRENCH SEASONS CHANGING
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS @ZeldaLord
LMAO
@ZeldaLord is this actually in the game
my friend whos playing p5 showed me it
let me look at my persona shitposts ffs
@ZeldaLord whats this
Is there
a FUCKING FILLER MONTH
is pixel 1984ing me
its good
i want him to play peak
@ZeldaLord does it make me makoto if i got into emo music because of peer pressure
hypothetically speaking
oh ok
nothing shut up
can u check the guide
me and my friend r gonna use this
dude zelda
i just rememebred yesterday waa my birthsay
we had some retarded school trip and i got home at 10
so i didnt even remember
well now i have a shitton of money do i buy episode slop (after p5 ofc)
also i csn finally spend a ton on monitors send me good monitors
oh i should get bz
yea
keyboard
headset maybe
youve seen the headset situation
only if angled wrong
i was experiencing persona 4s ending through only the left ear
@ZeldaLord why did i expect him to have common sense hes hardcheating again
actual retard
i need to find a new slave fast
i mean its justified if its for hardcheating
i never kicked him off before
yes
everyone is telling me to kick him off
because hardcheating on someone elses account who tells them not to is just dogshit selfish human behaviour
even skyblock gooners understand that
yk how im paranoid af?
im gonna self security ban after removing access just in case he somehow DOESNT lose access
how is that a dumb move
its 14d and doesnt put u on wipe status
nah
susorov got sec banned and got appeal accepted in like 2h

I DIDNT POST SHIT ZELDALORD
IVE HAD IT SINCE JUNE I JUST SAW IT WHEN GOING THROUGH OLD DMS
pixel is framing me for bait
dont listen to him ty
add me back this class is fucking killing me
im so fucking bored
how much of the story is maruki shit
the premise is very interesting
are parts of it there the entire story even before third semester or just shoehorned in start of third semester
ok one question
is royal handled better than golden
is it on spotify
does it even play in episode slop
GG
it plays in more than just akinari sl too
it plays in many sad sl scenes
i immediately went kimi no kioku when i heard it
living with determination i can only recall to be rank 10 akinari
i heard this REALLY early on into the game
before even june iirc
oh yea
i need to listen to itn ow
when is answer ost releasing on spotify
is moonlight daydream the larp kotone full moon full life
why replace soul phrase
its perfect
moonlight daydream is great but soul phrase is peak
THAT IS SO FUCKING GOOD????????????????????????????
IMAGINE THIS SHIT WITH THE BUDGET OF P3R OPENING
AND IN P3R AS FEMC ROUTE
WHAT THE FUCK PEAK ACTUAL PEAK
maga erwin was the kiryu makoto for me
youll know soon enough
yea
idc
youre watchin git
its peak
jjk vs aot is like p4 anime vs p4g
its also made by the 2 best anime studios
wit and mappa
who are also in p3 and p5
s1-s3 is wit and s4 is mappa
the gap between p5 gameplay graphics and the mappa animated scenes is so laughable
actually the 3d cutscenes are great in p5 too
its jsut the gameplay graphics could be uh a bit better
its fine tho ill endure it because im really interested in the maruki plot
what circle of hell does he belong in
thats the deleted dwagon account
he even speaks like him
YandereGogeta
PERSONA 3 RELOAD: EVERY SOCIAL LINK RANKED!
Persona as a franchise is well defined by one main mechanic, that being the Social Link/Confidant system, and with this system comes some that are good, and some that are bad. As is the way of the world, and in this video I rank all of the Social Links in the game that started it all for me. I hope you enjoy!

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK AND THE AUDIO CUTS OUT AND THE PC IS STILL ON
and i cant turn it off manually except if i turn off the power
THE POWER BUTTON
DOES NOTHING
ITS COSMETIC
IF I PRESS IT AFTER THE CRASHES NOTHING HAPPENS
IT WORKS OTHERWISE RETARD
BUT WHEN IT CRASHES AND PC STAYS ON THE POWER BUTTON WONT SHUT IT OFF
let me check
oh yea the blue glow around the power button is gone
listen
its because the power button wont light up
idfk
IT ACTUALLY FUCKING DID
NO FUCKING WAY WHAT THR FUCK
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THID SHIT
@ZeldaLord what the fuck is the meaning of this
and why the fuck are you speaking like thid
the joke fucking sucks because i am very obviously on phone
and the caps lock is actually broken
the thing that would light up on the other side of the keyboard when i activate it DOESNT LIGHT UP
what the fuck is the meaning of this?
@ZeldaLord what the fuck do i do???
i have no way of getting this shit checked out irl because of obvious reasons
its not an ark thing
this same thing happened so many times during p3r
ive literally told you about it
haha funny now can you please fucking help me turn the pc on
zelda
i cant do this shit irl
there is no fucking pc expert anhwhwre near where i live
IT NEVER SHUTS OFF
EVEN WHEN I TURN OFF THE POWER FROM BEHIND ITS IMMEDIATRLY BACK ON WHEN I TURN IT BSKC ON
FUCKING KILL YOURSELF
THE MOTHERBOARD LIGHTS ARE NOT LIGHTING UP AND THE CPU FAN ISNT MOVING
ONKY THR FUCKING CASE FANS AND CASE LIGHTS WORK NOW NOTHING ELSE
how is that
at all fucking related
to my pc completely dying
and me going completely broke again
well if you were here
you would know you cant just wear a short sleeve shirt in -1
5c was already cold enough
ITS BEEN LIKE THAT FOR LIKE 3 DAYS HOW THR FUCK IS THAT RELATED AT ALL
how the fuck
do i make jt work again
@ZeldaLord

niko oneshot in brainrot clash royale video called brawl stars character
{Reactions}
loaf
over
NOT A SINGLE FUCKING THING WORKS ANYMORE
CAN YOU HELP FFS
IM ABOUT TO JUST SHATTER THE ENTIRE THING ON THE GROUND
IT WENT FROM GPU TO LITERALLY THE ENTIRE PC
ONLY THE FUCKING CASE FANS AND LIGHTS STILL EORK
what do you think
could be fucking causing this
and how the fuck do you fix it
I DO NOT WANT TO BUY A NEW PC FOR SOMETHING THATS PROBABLY VERY FIXABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW HOW PCS WORK
WHY DO YOU THINK IM MESSAGING EVERYONE I KNOW LIKE A DESPERATE FAG INSTEAD OF DOING THAT IF IT WAS AN OPTION
THERE LITERALLY ARE NONE
IM NOT TAKING A ~4H BUS RIDE WITH MY FUCKING PC OR SOMETHING
the same parents who would not give me the last 150$ i was missing from buying the pc forcing me to sell my 2nd monitor because they hate electronics?
and do not make the "erm your parents arent entitled to giving you money" I LITERALLY GET 90$ A WEEK FOR FOOD AND CLOTHES IT WOULD BE NO ISSUE
why would the motherboard be fucked tho
for over a month it was gpu
yes the state of the pc is changing in real time.
it feels like the motherboard killed itself
because the power button isnt glowing and does nothing
and yes, the caps lock doesnt light up either
i hope i dont break anything
again its the best gpu they hsd
so if i get this back into a slightly functional state dyt i could make like 1k$ back
when i remove the gpu do i try launching
what if fully functional
well fuck i guess im using this until it gets severely outclassed by new products
ark survival ascended after uni i cant fucking wait!
@ZeldaLord could i perhaps
do what pixel does for graphics
so i can at least have other shit than videogames on pc for now
THE AMOUNT OF DUST IN THIS FUCKING THING
I ONLY EVER CLEANED THE OUTSIDE
how does he have geaphics wirhout a gpu
the cable from psu to gpu
its kinda hard to get out
the motherboars and cpu
arent on at all
so what the fuck do i do???
OH
I TRIED TO PUSH IN SOME CABLES A BIT MORE IT FULLY TURNED OFF
MORE SPECIFICALLY THE PSU CABLE INTO MOTHEBROARD
@ZeldaLord the fans and lights are dead
@ZeldaLord DOES THIS LOOK NORMAL TO YOU
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord
ARE THE PSU CABLES FUCKED
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord FUCKING ARIUND WITH THE CABLE INTO THE PINS MADE THE AREA OF THE MOTHERBOARD WHERE ITS SUPPOSED TO LIGHT UP FLASH
IS THIS COBFIRMATION ITS NOT FULLY DEAD
I FIXED THE OC
THE CPU LIT UP
PC IS BACK
every
single
cable
you can think of
was put in so badly
chat is this real
no
not at all
the mb cable was halfway in
somehow
mashallah im buying walking knight next sale
i dont have to go on the bus with my pc in some comically oversized bag
also
i literally pinged you in pj before leaving about this
oh there was an image attached
of are you sure you want to remove this
why is kill yourself automodded
oh ive been awake for 24 hours
because i wanted to fix the pc
i guess im free now
ohhh
anyway
for the sake of pixels free time and my sanity
the progress isnt even deleted i just removed the app
it should still be saved somewhere in steam
and i will eventually be playing it next holidays
because maruki is interesting
also
explanation for the power button
yk those tiny cables at the bottom?
those were barely in
ok as stupid as they are i need gloves
i was out for 1h 30 and my fingers almost fell off
WTF IS ELECTRIC CHAIR EXECUTION
also im reinstalling p5r please tell pixel to not do anything
thats cool however
biggest hear me out ever but
this ark map is literally peak
its subnautica level of good
and one of the zones is so similar to deep grand reef and cove tree
and the creatures are so cool and unique
its an entire new game
help architecthor keeps singing "kiddy diddler"
not even the graphics just the aesthetic
and it has actual horror elements to it like subnautica
and fun mechanics
hi im posting an ark loredump
system born = earth
fall = go from the arks in space to earth
sanctuaries = the city and the 2 prototype hot and cold arks
ancestors = as i said prototype arks 
flightless = very early stages of the arks shit as the island extinction note says so theyre on the ground as domes 
your ancestor = humanity extinct as evident by the hologram model of earth being completely fucked
born within the system = humanity extinct and its just dna of random people across earth from all timeframes being uploaded to whatever the fuck the system is 
design altered = survivors are literally DATA that can be uploaded and the implants presumably have it all stored but theyre still humans and have human dna
when you fall = sent to extinction aka earth 
homecoming more ways than one = both humans SOMEHOW repopulating a destroyed earth (the main thing i havent figured out yet) and the system is presumably hosted on earth so both the humanity and the ark tech fuckery return to earth and the prototype arks
this also confirms that arks were being developed when humanity still existed and not something advanced ai made 294923 billion years after only thing i cant figure out is what wiped out earth ive also finally figured out now what the extinction map truly is its the facility where arks were being first created and tested and also probably the birthplace of the system that would also let them put dinosaurs on earth because they escaped the long abandoned prototype arks when humanity went extinct so safe to say everything from scorched and the island is on extinction and probably new ice creatures
so now for abberation the map im playing rn
THIS CONFIRMS
THAT THERES PEOPLE ALIVE OUTSIDE THE ARKS ON SOME FUCKING SPACESHIP
AND THEY CAME TO ABBERATION BEFORE ROCKWELL BASICALLY DESTROYED AND MUTATED IT BECAUSE THE EXPLORER NOTE SHOWS A BARRIER
BUT WHEN YOU ASCEND FROM THE ISLAND THERES NO BARRIER AROUND IT UNLIKE FOR SCORCHED
WHICH MEANS THE TEK COLONY PEOPLE FROM SOME SPACESHIP ARRIVED ON ABBERATION EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER HELENA AND ROCKWELL BUT DEFINITELY BEFORE ROCKWELL FUCKED UP ABBERATION
THIS ALSO EXPLAINS THE HUGE AMOUNT OF TEK SHIT ON ABBERATION
ARK: Survival Evolved Season Pass on Steam
its peak it has all 3 maps scorched earth, abberation and extinction
700+ hours of genuine peak graphics gameplay worldbuilding and storytelling for the low price of 15$
if i buy hk do you promise youll buy this
you do not understand
the peak that is abberation
its like subnautica all over again and im only 5h in
its like an entirely different game
also the visuals are good as in the aesthetic and setting not just the graphics
its a really similar vibe to subnautica
and subnautica isnt the best graphics but had one of the best visuals
so its not about the graphics.
theres also reapers (theyre like reaper leviathans but black and extremely scary)
ill download
btw is hk off rn
im buying it when it is
wait i know what to say
if half life 2 is so apparently so "good"
whyd they never make half life 3
do i buy it
@ZeldaLord why are the graphics insanely good for a TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR GAME
whats this btw
wait is half life 2 coop
oh these exist too
most exams are gonna be done so ill have more free time
and france is hosting the ark server and we have insanely conflicting schedules
so its like 3h ark a day average
so i can finally get to playing shit like portal and undertale
portal 2 is multi right
wym
france said he did the entire game coop with a guy
bex
oh
wym
wow the graphics are pretty peak
also this is kinda like an ark
is this like p3p and p3r
is it like some uh fanmade thing?
is it a remake or a big change
this looks so good
anything i should know before i play
why not just make them free
pressing the verification on my phone 2 times is effort
what is
"the combine from half life"
i just heard it in a subnautica video im watching
what
the
fuck
original p3 memories of the city is
something else
HOLY SHIT PISSOWNER
well my memory isnt that good
oh my god
OHHHH
HOWD I NEVER NOTICE
LOLL
hey can you shoot me? thanks
THANK GOD I LEFT BOTH OF THOSE HELLHOLES
i dont wanna witness another month of pixel with nitro
its scary
gc and pj
what
i left
i pingrd you to kill yourself then left
both gc and pj
@ZeldaLord add me to gc theres an ark anime and im streaming it
@ZeldaLord never call me unfunny ever again
@ZeldaLord save me
ok what if
i just stream it
and if anyone wants to see it they can join
its an ark anime zelda
why so serious?
how am i the painfully unfunny one
well
i do that to share my burden with you
the burden of dealing with someone so retarded every day because of goonblock
im greedy
despite him being the addict
ive realized i somehwo care more about skyblock than him
if i bought you the abberation dlc would you play it with me
id teach you everything
why
why do you hate on it for no reason?
put its peak
OK FINE
zeldalord
should i stop doing one thing i like doing because i just feel like its time to move on from it completely and it isnt even as enjoyable as i remember it to be and i want to do other shit too
readd me im bored
i like talking to pixel
its comedical
NO
?
INV ME TO PJ
??? the fuck is he saying
did you talk to him or smt
HDUQ
my boyfriend was posting these
you called the brocolli shit schizophrenic?
i just read this
Yeah... i hate to don the tinfoil hat but there's real signs it's not over in the teaser video alone.
He's been dropping hints for a while that he draws inspiration from being a Gemini and the teaser trailer that dropped minutes before this one points to that again.  We saw with the Not Like Us video that PG Lang loves the detail
In the trailer, we see him get OUT of one of the TWO GNXs. 
He leaves it parked and still running but facing the opposite direction. The other GNX that is already parked there also running implying that somone is there already.
We then see Kendrick get out of the car in the same outfit that is on the GNX cover.
We get a verse which summarizes the themes of GNX: Fuck everyone else, reincarnation, war ready but driven by Love, a nod to his pen / writing. 
We also get a mention of "his gemini twin" in that verse
The camera cuts to kendrick in a different outfit, in a event storage area,  and the beat switches to a more aggressive beat. 
This new kendrick is kneeling on top of a black piano and a black set of event chairs. To the back of the frame there is a set of white event chairs facing the opposite way.
The video ends at the 1 minute mark mid verse indicating there's more.
PG lang is way too disciplined to make the teaser include a song that ended up the cutting room floor. Especially with the production having the traditional Kendrick feel. 
That being said GNX is not a teaser or mixtape. It's a legitimate album that fills in some of the critiques of his discography. Ive listened to it front to back at least 6 times and it only gets better. It does feel like its not Kendrick rapping at the height of his abilities though.
did i ping you
i meant to ping pixel
second
can you explain this
does this happen regularly in pjbw gc?
i assume you are home
@ZeldaLord
want a quick stream of smt?

i took a break from ark prob for the rest of the day cuz ive played so much but a part of me needs to keep going and progressing
im watching clash royale to distract my brian
i shall not ark
this is like
subnautica but scarier and better graphics for ketamine addicts who never sleep
also the grindiness of skyblock
tldr give me subnautica 2 to restore my sanity
surely they meant jan 2025...
is it subnautica gameplay level peak
and p3r story level peak
ive seen it glazed so much it better be pure peak
running in the morning not the evening cured my depression
is it the oneshot type of peak
short game with insane story and lore that just makes you think for a few days after
what the fuck
are you fr

could i interest you in 5 hours and 26 minutes of ark lore
it is some of the best story ive seen ever and definitely the best lore and storytelling in any videogame
ill send you the links if youre interested
you will not regret it
ok sorry

subnautica was eh
the gameplay would make it top 3 but the lore is ehh
wouldnt this be fire?
AVERAGE FUCKING PERSONA FAN

is this better bait
thats ark players for ark 2
(they made a complete remake of all maps in unreal engine 5 instead of ark 2 which was meant to release in 2023)
Cause and effect is the way of the universe. Everything must start somewhere. In the case of the System, this is where it was born. You will fall right into its cradle.
Together, the sanctuaries and the Obelisks that power them are the ancestor of every island that floats in the sky. They can all can trace their origins back to this single prototype. Though it is flightless, the core principles and technology behind it are the same.
In a way, that makes it your ancestor too. You were all born within the System, after all. Even if your design is somewhat altered, in a way, you're all its children.
One could say that when you fall, it will be something of a homecoming. In more ways than one.
system born = earth
fall = go from the arks in space to earth
sanctuaries = the city and the 2 prototype hot and cold arks
ancestors = as i said prototype arks 
flightless = very early stages of the arks shit as the island extinction note says so theyre on the ground as domes

WHERE IS TANAKA????
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
THERES A GENERIC HOST
WHERE THE FUCK IS TANAKA
that friend who was playing p5r is using the same exact guide hop off
he sent me it
i didnt use any guide for p3 and p4
ok fair enough i wont use a guide
@ZeldaLord theres a ton of free time right
yk the
dont do non school sls on school days from p3
anything like that i should know for p5?
is it easier than p4 in terms of schedule management
p4 schedule management was utter fucking hell
everything was all over the place
p3 was tighter on time but actually organised
since p5 released after p4 i assume they improved the scheduling?
is it possible that p4 was harder than p3 for me because it was my first pissowner game and for first 2 months i never used the right pissowners
@ZeldaLord WHAT
HUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
DIDNT SHE GO TO AFRICA OR SOMETHING
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
uehara
the nurse from p4
NAH BRO
SHES CALLING A NURSE IN THE SEQUEL GAME TO P4
what the fuck
adding what
i mean
it doesnt make sense
because she went to africa
and completely quit being a nurse
hell the fuck no
does takemi sl get better or is it always liek this
the concept of the story in the sl is really interesting but can she be normal
@ZeldaLord is this bad
p4 night sls were bad

so
are the top 3 sls just top 3 because limited or also good abilities
also whats that
sumire showtime akechi third awakening thing you said in a spoiler once

ILL FUCKING DESTROY YOU
i havent spent a single dollar on it
its a huge handicap because i have no evos but i only play with friends so its fine
grabbing some bacon fries rn then bus home
im on the bus
no its some pixel game
like that adachi game he made
how fucking high was he
ok educated guess
its some hl/portal scene which has a shitton of france
im home in like
20 mins
do you hsve that weird 5pm school
are you being architecthor?
skipping school for 3 days to solo clear m7?
even the other skyblock gooners called him insane
ok almost home
Started a call that lasted 11 minutes.
what
he looks stupid
nah
nah
nah
nah
nah
NAH
who fucking
made this
nah what is this
this is the equivalent
of that adachi thing pixel made
but for half life
is this what waiting 22 years for a game leads to???
this?????????
zeldalord one
im fairly certain this wasnt made to actually be played
wait is that multiple mods
i have no words
you call me insane for playing ark?
i dont know what virtual end is
OH THAT SONG LMFAO
ok what retarded 14 year old made that
floppa eleven
@ZeldaLord im
very confused
if its supposed to be satire
or not
because since its 15y old that shit was taken seriously back then
IM WATCHING RN WHAT THE FUCK
THIS IS
SO FUCKING HORRIBLE
im killing myself
from this
I CANT TAKE IT
is there anyone who still SERIOUSLY believes in hl3
wow thats sad
yk what hl3 reminds me of?
aoe
man.
who is geoff
how did he bait
look zelda the scarf is black
this is confirmation of aoe because uhhhhh uhhhh uhhh
(this is a real thing people believed)
me nad carrot
will explain everything
some day
whats hdtf
what is htat
WHY DID HE DO ANOTHER 39.9 HOURS AFTER SAYING THAT
LMAO
this reminds me of
would you happen to be familiar
with this image thats been all over the internet/
thats unironically an ark review
i dont watch furry inflation fetishists
i heard recently
hes even been intentionally making references to it
so im scared to open any videos
oh its just 7s
anyways
why is hunt down the freeman so bad
nah actually tell me what makes it so bad tho
i like playing bad games its really entertaining when something is pure fucking slop
how was that not playtested
skyblock level of playtesting istg
LMFAO
anyway so zelda
whats a good first souls game
dont say ds2
i need to play one because ark 2 is apparently gonna have souls like combat
ok which one is actually good
also whats your thoughts on elden ring fortnite dlc
its like hypixel skyblock dungeons
3 people kill shit then kill boss in one run
ok which one is the most melee combat focused
and hardest
depends on if they delay it even more
id play more than one souls game
whats a good one to start
which is basically like a tutorial for all the other ones
yea ik i meant like
i was gonna give an ark analogy but fuck that
ok so
kamoshida palace
its an actual palace but its mainly a tutorial for the games combat in general
what souls game is the most like that
ok which is easiest for beginners
and do they all have lore as good as elden ring
ok then which one is the best gameplay and best lore
graphics i dont care about that much but elden ring graphics are SO FUCKING GOOD
hey can you tell pixel to unblock i have a question for him
ok ill get elden ring
its visually one of the best games
far better than even ark
ITS 400 HOURS LONG???
were you by any chance using steam achievement manager mr zeldalord
thats stupid tho itd make people think u used sam
i do that for ark but for building
how can you get banned
in elden ring
huh
isnt the pvp kinda optional and not that big of a focus
COOP EXISTS???
actually no france is broke he cant get it
yea ik
so coop is multiplayer er?
im gonna force someone to buy er and play with me
whats that
oh that reminds
zelda would you help with malenia 🥺
whyyy
also stupid question but does er coop have proximity chat
surely
how buffed are the bosses in coop mode
is this one trustable
which 2 were trustable again
?? why
its over 30 dollars difference
???
on steam or
for winter sale
would er go under 27$ on steam or nah
do i just buy key
well 27$ for a key seems pretty cheap
does bloodborne pc port exist yet
youve had this status for like 3y
germany too or nah
why wouldnt they tho
are they stupid?
people would pay a lot for it
just order?
does serbia have insane shipping or smt
OHHHHH
wait christmas is in 5 days
i can finaly buy a new gpu and cpu
should i wait to play elden ring until i have a 4070ti
ok do i get a 1440p 144hz monitor before elden ring then i feel like thats a much bigger difference
60hz tho
oh i just went through the biology shit
i am
so fucking cooked
make your status something like "pex gex 666" now
how is it lore
5????
i first saw it like 3y ago
whens the best time to buy shit
idgaf the shipping time but when are pc parts gonna be the cheapest
you just bought a ps5
is it cheaper to buy before or after christmas
nah just in general
oh quite a big discount
ill just buy a key
9 dollar
?
85 dollars
can i pirate it
yes er is quite expensive
studio wildcard is an indie developer group that has no money and barely any employees which excuses the horrible optimization and worse delays than atlus
oh yeq
did atlus do anything in the game awards?
or no p6
zeldalord learns about satire
he says, with the price being higher than a 4070ti
anyways how did you know are you a closeted ex ark player
i mean if you quit fair enough the bullshit they spew is genuinely insane
im just too addicted to
idfk what a rsd is
oh serbia is cheap ig?
is there evn any reason to own a ps5 besides bloodborne
everything is on pc no?
and pc is better
so bloodborne pc port IS real in some form
change your status to "i love eating slop"
oh
zelda the bulking is over
after like 10 months of pure bulk im gonna start cutting
which means literally nothing but chicken and rice until i reach the aesthetic physique i want
but i will still season it
also
ive been told apparently now i have to weigh my food
and have same amount of calories in rice and chicken for every meal
which is effort as fuck
google "bodybuilding"
ok zelda
lets make a compromise
stop judging my eating habits and ill stop judging yours
idc if you eat your bacon fries slop but let me do what i do
this is not some bullshit i came up with literally research this
google "cutting"
zelda
maybe its your view on things thats stupid not the things you call stupid
"LMAO HOW DO YOU FAIL BIOLOGY" the exact number of 16 of my classmates:
not exclusively
ill also do salmon and shit
and obv im steal gonna do breakfast and fruits and vegetables
only thing im doing is less calories in meals and absolutely nothing with any fat
no zelda i mean
high amounts of fat with that
i know everything has fat im not THAT retarded
how am i pulling that
everyone around me is sane and i am sane too
youre the one calling me my entire friendgroup and my entire class retarded
no
have you considered
that we value playing clash royale and fucking around over studying the most boring shit imagineable ?
actually
considering they fail some other subjects too
ok some might be retarded but not everyone
idk how 9 people failed a geography exam yet here we are
(i got an a without studying)
everywhere i go theres haters
no he has an eating disorder according to you
didnt you say its an eating disorder to count calories.
FOR THE LAST FUCKING TIME
ITS NOT BOILED CHICKEN
LOOK ILL SEND A PIC WHEN I MAKE THE NEXT ONE
REMIND ME IN LIKE 3H OK
wym w that
anyway the entire point is to
actually be aware of how much calories you have per meal and in the entire day
@ZeldaLord you are aware right
that even for bulking people do that
are you gonna say thats an eating disorder too?
not anymore
i will be seasoning my food
ok true ig but i dont do it anymore
no i do it in the normal way now trust me
anyway zeldalord would you be interested in me shilling workout to you
from what ive been doing the past 10 months you dont even need to go outside you can do it all in your room with 4 dumbells!
the results speak for themselves
or i have stupidly op genetics
probably both
anyway zeldalord
did you know
you can eat healthy food and it can taste extremely good?
way better than any fast food slop?
since ive started seasoning my food i realized how good it can get
you dont need to eat ice cream or fast food because trust me you can definitely make way better food yourself
ok fair enough i get a schnitzel every week too
what do you eat as your regular lunch and dinner
i really want to give a good comparison/allegory but the only good ones i can think of are either ark or skyblock
that emoji sucks
the ice cream crashout was more of an overexaggeration
not theb acon fries tho thats just disgusting
even if it wasnt pure slop and extremely unhealthy id still hate it
i could never eat that
bulking is NOT binge eating
do you think i liked the unseasoned boiled chicken and rice or that i ate it as protein fuel
because it isnt
the normal meals i have
i properly enjoy
the boiled chicken is just pure misery until the plastic container is empty
i always get it done fast tho
well you have to make sacrifices in life
ok i thought of a comparison that isnt skyblock
or ark
zelda do you study because you like school and studying or because you have to pass
.
this is literally boiled chicken, zelda
yes its fucking miserable but its needed
whats the better outlook
"i hate eating this miserable food i should stop ngl"
"this is nesseccary protein fuel"
i did
i will provide image proof
big pex is lying to you seasoning sucks out all of the protein
also
i eat like kinda normal food now
from 2 boiled chicken for just fuel 2 seasoned chicken to 2 seasoned chicken for just fuel 1 seasoned chicken as an actual meal not just to eat asap from a plastic container and 1 rice bowl with soy sauce soy beans avocado and a shitton of salmon
(salmon is good protein)

@ZeldaLord
hello
i have a picture of the chicken
are you here
is he stupid?
look seasoning
@ZeldaLord oh my fucking god
so zelda you never answered
what do you eat normally
i wont judge just curious
is it stupid?
is this what 22 years does to people
2031
is salvation
and i will be sane again
no
10 years will pass
april 9th 2031
fumble of the century
LMFAO
LMFAO
no
would you believe me if i told you that as dogshit as the game can get arks lore is peak writing
"spoil"
hasnt the game been out for yk
22 years
why is heb lack
is hl woke
is hl woke?
genuinely what??
on the topic of horrible financial decisions
this truly has been our answer
i cba to goon ark anymore really
i burned out after playing for 6h at like 3 am
i am not buying something that invalidates peak fiction
@ZeldaLord oh my fucking god they added a prawn suit to ark
ok what the fuck is a shin megami tensei
they still made those???
i thought they stopped after literally persona 1
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord
IS THIS HALF LIFE
@ZeldaLord they fucking retconned the ark ending which was perfect
they literally made a episode slop for ark
i cant believe this shit
im a purist for the first game now i am never buying that 4070ti
is that hl
also is the new ending of hl that they made a complete joke that makes no sense by any chance
lwgit never heard of tjem
i just know persona series started from it
whats even the gameplay and plot
literally just as i read the comment "crazy theyre changing endings but not optimizing their game"
anyways i had an epiphany today
graphics =/= how good a game looks
this new ark map remake has the most recent insane graphics but they fumbled it SO HORRIBLY that it looks horrendous
you do not put insanely bright lighting in a wasteland and weird yellow fog in only place supposed to still be kinda alive
it looks fucking horrible
i cant believe they killed the best lore in any media to sell a 30$ dlc
and theyre gonna continue the retarded retconned storyline based on the horrible animatrd series for ark 2
which means once i finish this ark map ark is done
because im not playing slop
you do know a game can suck ass but still have insanely good story
wait how old are souls games wtf
how hard would you say er is
what if im stupid
EVEN AI
@ZeldaLord we found hl2 brainrot on the gay porn subreddit
WHY SO PEXIOUS???
???
did he find those
or made them himself
what.
what the fuck bait
hello
what is this?
if youre trying to say something with this ill gladly play extinction with you
aberration too its a really fun map its like cave subnautica :D
oh was he
kms
im buying a rope
i hate all of you cucks
archi was right for spamming you with black men
how was this not part of it
RE
INSTALL
IT
zelda itll be so fun
ill make a gc with you me and the french fag
and we play ark
and itll be so fun
ark is free
first map is with the base game
oh yeah fun fact
if my other french friend wasnt a CUCK WHO DOESNT TALK IN VC i wouldve never bothered you with ark i dont think
ark after? 🥺
were gonna play a modded version of ragnarok after extinction apparently its peak
u should join
@ZeldaLord GOOD MORNING
IM FUCKING KILLING MYSELF
ALL WINDOWS HOTKEYS STOPPED WORKING BUT THEYRE NOT TURNED OFF
WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO
I RESET PC LIKE 289329 TIMES
NOT EVEN THIS
WHAT THE FUCK IS CAUSING IT???
NOTHING WITH THE WINDOWS KEY
oh its fixed now
i had to smash my entire keyboard while holding fn
?
i just got out of bed
what the fuck
???????
idk i didnt avtually read it
OK YEA THATS TRUE
NUTS THE BERK MAN
was his sword extremely big by any chance
LMFOASOSOOSJDBEJD
oh nothing
could i also see the sword being held ingame to confirm my suspicions?
LMFAOOOO
you were invaded by a very dedicated berk cosplayer
im watching ark video and
persona 3 reference????????????????????????
do i study or watch a 6h ark video after finishing a 3h ark video
i think the choice is clear
@ZeldaLord i understand the p3fes purists now
new ark will NEVER be able to compare to old ark even with unreal engine 7284972638982628598164893616499
although p3r is leagues better than p3fes so idk about that part
oh yea theres 80 p3s i just remembered
yeah but mainly the art direction
also they added a p2w creature which is just no.
wait 1s
i need to show you a few comparisons
so you can see how fucking SLOPPY it is
yes
the new ark is just light mode spam
for context the setting is a dying uninhabitale toxic wasteland
its like an entirely different team designed all this
ZERO consideration for the original aesthetic and the setting of the map
they all probably left because the behind the scenes is pretty sloppy
and they went bankrupt because of being retarded like 80 times
basically atlus 2
holy shit YOU CAN SHOW OFF YOUR RAY TRACING BULLSHIT WITHOUT SPAMMING LIGHT IN EVERYONES FACE IN EVERY LOCATION
it looks like ai garbage
and i wouldnt be surprised if it is
with ark 2 do you mean ark 2 the game thats never coming out or ark ascended
also yeah they killed all official servers but those are cancer and tryhard anyway
that happened in like august
i really want to get into ark pvp servers
where you just play like 12h+/d
look HYPOTHETICALLY i dont ever need to work because my parents have enough money
im obviously not that stupid but there IS an ideal reality where for the rest of my life im just playing ark every day all day for the rest of my life
it doesnt affect you in the slightest id be enjoying it
i played only ark all summer 14h/d
did i get bored?
literally only reason i didnt play ark in september and october is because school was starting and french school schedule is fucking cancer
i also become mentally ill when school starts
so i wasnt really feeling it
someone did almost 9k hours in 2y
theres multiple people with over 50k hours btw
yes, that is roughly 5 and a half years
there is over 350+ people with 10000 hours
only reason im burned out rn is because
im retarded
i dont want to play ark because im supposed to study but i dont want to study so i just end up watching clash royale youtube being completely unproductive for school or ark
crisps fucking suck
so does alcohol if youre alone
and tv also sucks you can just watch youtube on pc

I VC WITH THIS BRITISH GUY A LOT
IM FUCKING BRAINROTTED FROM IT
how old are these people
easily influenced from what
persona was
"i need something thats a dopamine hit for oblique crunches"
"maybe that stupid japan game song could work"
"wow this is actually good"
"wow i should give this a try ill try the cheapest game first because im not paying 70 dollars for potential slop"
p3r is the best game besides aberration
oh yea this reminds me

with each passing day
im starting to think my school actually is retarded
didnt open the video i only saw the thumbnail
look beards age up people
yo lowk thats kinda aura tho
how retarded is it that
i went to the city once just to observe clothing people wear
oh gg
slightly oversized would be aura tho
LMFAO
NO FUCKING SHOT
can he make one insult
that isnt a reference to rot
he should rename to onion's 16 year old
hey ive used this one like twice
its the others
anyway zelda
can you recommend any aura winter clothes
not what you wear just what looks best
im kinda freezing
idk how else to describe
what im looking for
i avoid brainrot words when talking to you cucks
but if i dont have normal words for it then im just gonna use brainrot words
holy fuck im genuinely having a stroke trying to describe this
just
good looking winter clothes that are a flex to others
that
i need that
just like
good looking sigma outfit
i cant define sigma
im like re ally bad
ate xplaining this
just
good looking winter clothes that stand out
???????????
i did
if hl2 was so good
why was there not a hl3?
yeah i think if it was actually good
theyd want to make another one
hl3posting is one person on multiple accounts the only fan of it
you
are those actual good dlcs
or slop so bad that noone wants to consider it canon (the answer)
anyway one question real quick
yes or no
isnt hte cliffhanger retconned
LMAO
also zeldalord why do u larp as one of the people waiting for hl2 for 22y
ur 16-18
uve waited like 5y at most
silksong is like 4y smt
youve been waiting for quite a long time huh
would you call yourself The One Who Waits?
maybe She Who Waits if you became trans?
how long is bb pc port
i had a 2y long cope but it was so horrible and painful
it was aoe
and it never did and never will happen
be happy hl had a cliffhanger not an ending that ruined everything it built up to
also when did u originally play hl
also is "hlx" even confirmed to be half life
or just something abbreviated to hlx
itd be so fucking funny if this was the case
do you get the joke zeldalord
lainah
he wants to kill himself
@ZeldaLord do you want to see peak fiction
@ZeldaLord answer me
here you go
isnt this peak?
maybe you can relate to him youre both cucks
10 years at least zeldalord
@ZeldaLord HEY
ZELDA
YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAID
SUBNAUTICA 2 HAS SOME GUY THAT YAPS IN YOUR HEAD 24/7
SO I WENT ON THIS ARK MAP AND THERES THIS ROBOT THING
THAT YAPS TO YOU FOR EVERY SINGLE ACTION YOU PERFORM
ITS INSANE
huh

oops forgot automod exists
what was onion talking about
i forgot automod again ^-^

well here its
ark flashbang edition
yes
they just fucking spray random colors everywhere
youve seen the purple right?
"foolish"
a new world fool....
"creepy green light"
tartarus syndrome
"that wouldve been ideal"

ok so
it is an unfair situation you get me?
we were gonna pin it on this guy
however in an unexpected turn of events you happened to kick him a few hours ago
therefore i will be remaining silent
and onion is also partially to blame not just me and pixel
wt
f

hey zelda you should take like a few of the osts i sent
and listen
theyre actually good
like really good
the titles are probably made by a down syndrome kid mashing the keyboard though
some schizos tried to make sense of them (there is nothing to make sense of)
yeah its real fucking annoying trust me

@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
Started a call that lasted 0 minutes.
need song
fast
right now
anything
NUTS BERKERMAN
what.
LMA
fatlus???
@ZeldaLord this ark dlc fucking sucks.
i played 5h theres some weird fucking mission things that are just a complete joke (dodo basketball), theres thsi weird bloodstalker creature which you tame by making a ton of blood packs then letting it drink it (1 hour of effort) and its so fucking weird and goofy
just like aberration its like a completely different game but this time in a bad sense
like genuinely what is this thing supposed to be.
utter slop.
Started a call that lasted 0 minutes.
ok ur here
great to know
first comment
zelda
that is a 15 year old
that you posted
zelda i truly dont think he wanted you to post that in a server with 50 people
honestly i dont know why he wouldve even sent that to you in the first place
thats his fucking picture retard and hes a minor take it down
do you think this looks cool
i got a max level magmasaur on day 9 idk why people call this map hard
I WILL FUCK YOUR DEPRRSSED SERBIAN ASSHOLE NIGGER
I WILL RAPE YOUR ASSHOLE
I WILL FUCK YOUR WAFFLE PUSSY
ill tell the french fag to just simply dm you
who knows what hes gonna send
ur a black nigger
unban me cuck
im a closeted persona fan
no that is not me
nah
id say something like
"gg max level start the breeding line now"
yes thats what i just said?
are you retarded?????
anyways zelda i was hating for no reason
from gameplay perspective the map is perfect and easily the best one
it doesnt have most of the bullshit ark would have otherwise
oh
id give my wife 2 male 40hp 40damage gigas to start the mutation lines
also a few females with the same stats
cuz u need 1 male and a shitton of females on a mutation line for one stat
and seperated
so u only progress in the mutation u need
anyways its really funny how i got 42 stamina on a 180 magmasaur when its 7 stats and each level is 1 point
and stam is kinda useless on them
zelda if i buy u genesis season pass would u play
its actually fun for some reason???????
like i never had so much fun in ark
why
no no zelda
its actually fun
idk how but it is
its one of the newest dlcs so ig they improved
i was hating on it because its completely unserious and the lore sucks
but the gameplay is so good
unban me waffle cuck
why did you even in the first place
very funny zelda
anyways reinv
because you know LETHAL COMPANY
that game you hate playing
ur a miserable gooner
r u doing this cuz i play ark
only brutalcompany can be annoying
its peak otherwise
r u gonna stop being a fat cuck if i stop playing ""slop""
so i can play lethal with one leveret command instead of dming fifty people
ok give constructive criticism
instead of saying it sucks
what could be imrpoved
ok ill tell ben to remove you from the ping just unban me
ill stop bothering you with lethal but i want to play it myself at least
cba
zelda
everyone knows this
why would he send me it
is he stupid
is the joke here that mistral is french
very funny zeldalord
youve outdone yourself with this one
DEWNFTRBNWEKRN342[RKOP23EJMWQKPDL]
THE LYRICS JUST SYNCED WITH THE "exactly what weve been looking for" IN ARK
@ZeldaLord good morning
ok so i went to buy new shoes for running
and wow actual clothes exist
how do i learn this shit tgo
shit that looks good

thanks
LOOK I WASNT IN THE MOOD TO THINK
OK STOP DODGING THE QUESTIO NWHAT DO YO UWEART

rly fun minigame i was just abt to play it in the arctic biome
ok let me star
makoto pants
what are they called again
not specifically black just those
AHAHAHA
THE ARK ROBOT WAS SAYING GIBBERISH AND I LEGITIMATELY THOUGHT IT WAS FRENCH
WHAT THE FUCK DO I GO OFF
JUST TELL ME WHAT ITS CALLED
YOUVE NAMED IT BEFORE
i cba
also unironically if i have anything more than discord and maybe spotify open when playing ark ill crash a ton
ask the french fag
he also crashes if he has anything open while ark
just stop dodging the question and tell me what you wear
unban me
chemistry class is boring
i need smt to look at
wdym
i saw hl porn on my reddit recommended today

what yes
NAH WHAT
inv rn
it is my duty to defend floch and the yeagerists
what
can this connect to ark

NIGGER
WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO TO PLAY THE GAME
IT RESETS WHEN I TRY CHANGING THE RES
oh yea zelda how am i supposed to kill a ton of soldiers and trolls with a wooden club.
where do i get weapons, zelda
oh ok
im not supposed to instantly go rush stormveil RIGHTTTTTT
zelda
do not
the french
the amount of french people on earth is quite disturbing
@ZeldaLord they made another aberration asset flip on valguero but its actually good
its laughable how they used the exact same lore relevant portal on a non canon bullshit everything goes map tho
is making headcanons about ark a reason why i deserve to be euthanized
i alr closed it
yea
what platform is it on
Ocarina of Time v1.0 ROM
whats this
Once BizHawk has been installed, open EmuHawk and change the following settings:
    (≤ 2.8) Go to Config > Customize. Switch to the Advanced tab, then switch the Lua Core from "NLua+KopiLua" to "Lua+LuaInterface". Then restart EmuHawk. This is required for the Lua script to function correctly. NOTE: Even if "Lua+LuaInterface" is already selected, toggle between the two options and reselect it. Fresh installs of newer versions of EmuHawk have a tendency to show "Lua+LuaInterface" as the default selected option but still load "NLua+KopiLua" until this step is done.
    Under Config > Customize > Advanced, make sure the box for AutoSaveRAM is checked, and click the 5s button. This reduces the possibility of losing save data in emulator crashes.
    Under Config > Customize, check the "Run in background" and "Accept background input" boxes. This will allow you to continue playing in the background, even if another window is selected.
    Under Config > Hotkeys, many hotkeys are listed, with many bound to common keys on the keyboard. You will likely want to disable most of these, which you can do quickly using Esc.
    If playing with a controller, when you bind controls, disable "P1 A Up", "P1 A Down", "P1 A Left", and "P1 A Right" as these interfere with aiming if bound. Set directional input using the Analog tab instead.
    Under N64 enable "Use Expansion Slot". This is required for savestates to work. (The N64 menu only appears after loading a ROM.)
It is strongly recommended to associate N64 rom extensions (*.n64, *.z64) to the EmuHawk we've just installed. To do so, we simply have to search any N64 rom we happened to own, right click and select "Open with…", unfold the list that appears and select the bottom option "Look for another application", then browse to the BizHawk folder and select EmuHawk.exe.
im sorry what.
ok i ran the emuhawk thing nothing is happening

what year and month
anyways my first contact with persona was
now bear with me.
i tried to find a guys discord account
(all i had was display name and pfp)
and the pfp was adacchi.
i had to reverse image search it and look for adachi pfps.
at the time i thought he was some ace detective sequel character
it was december 2023 so pre zelda buys p3r
?
oh my god i found the ss
the first known instance of flochforster coming into contact with persona
WAIT I REMEMBER SEEING THAT TOO
DID YOU SHOW ME THAT POST PLAYING P3 OR WHEB

@ZeldaLord how fast did u finish p4?
i did it in 16d apparently
i went to sleep so i wouldnt cry right after
HOW DO ONLY 16% HAVE THIS ONE

wait is getting a new credit card expensive
surely its a worth investment tho
when buying from kinguin did u also have issues with ur bank declining the payment
yea
thats the point
im done with the stupid restrictions
hm but
itd be worth it so i could actually buy more games without paying pixels entire familys networth
?
which games
but honestly my bank sometimes even declined fucking steam.
and id have to call.
buying subnautica was genuine hell and i had to buy it for full price too
wdym...?
WHO THE FUCK
the "certain individuals" in question:
wait
would u buy p4r if it was 100$
i would honestly
omg itd be so good
hollow forest could be like a dlc that would heavily expand upon it
its p4r
take my money take my wife take my kids take my house
what would u consider an actual highly priced game on steam
the fuck...
bro zelda life could be so grea
if i could buy steam keys

dragan jovanovic
does atlus have anything planned for 2025 btw
or can they actually start working on p4r
how so
oh i was just referring to makoto as dragan jovanovic
which happens to be your name too
what.
YOU WERE JUST GETTING RANDOM PERSONA SHIT ON TWITTER RIGHT
what
WHAT
zelda
the game is fucking ruined
i cant believe even atlus does this disgusting annoying gen z marketing
so whats on the desk
that promotes shumitsu
how did he even make thst out
actual schizophrenic
ATTACK ON TITAN
zelda
lets watch aot
why not
yea yea its french
zelda why do u larp as a frenchie
u LOVE french shit
the "person" who pointed out the pins
has a shumitsu pfp
how much worse can it get.
it was ragebait prime
i dont actually goon to shumitsu
pixel was hating it
i saw that on reddit
prime shumitsu gooner
zelda if you want full context
that nig who drew that draws all the weird persona shit uve ever seen
yeah
he even made
the aigis one
the android fisting
oh my fucking god
also pixel goons to everything sumire related
that looks so uncanny wtf
i dont want to imagine the rot he could make
example: the guy who made the joker x akechi animation
the worst part is there was actual effort put into it even the voice acting
WHAT?
EIGHTY ONE???
??????
first world country pixel
example?
i watched this WHAT THE FUCK
CHILLS
CHILLS YOU SAY?
yes
@ZeldaLord WHAT THE FUCK
zelda i found something insane
were watching something today with pixel
its the most rotten thing ive seen in my life
nvm
it doesnt get said in the anime
no rot womp womp
@ZeldaLord if you thought smoke some drink some pop one was bad
IF YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS BAD
well just know i found something so horrible
watch it its peak
is this intentional
AHAHAHAHA
where
AHAHAHAHAHAHAH
p4 is peak tho
u should do spot the rot im procrastinating studying until my food is done
when
FUCKS SAKE FIRST POST ON OKBP IS THID SHIT
is this canon?
genuinely who the fuck made the answer
it was made a few years after original p3 release right
no way the same people who made the peakest story and conclusion would just fuck it up for a free aigis dlc
it was free in fes
isnt fes also way harder
he lives???
ok thats the canon ending then obviously
who the fuck would take the answer as canon
from what ive seen it is SO poorly written
or buy the keys for all 3 ds games
but the answer being more expensive than subnautica is MENTAL
see if we had this i wouldnt have been depressed for a month
@ZeldaLord i saw a reddit post and people are hating on the ending
yap yap theme of the game LET PEOPLE BE HAPPY
this might sound weird but
the old lady in aigis sl shouldve died
wouldve made it even more impactfyl
yes itd make it even worse
her grandson
they could overhear him
at school
and maybe have some small character arc for him where he has the same realization as aigis
egytp has winter?
has pixel ever seen snow
"yukaris thighs" flair on official persona sub.
personally would never wear one
dont both makoto and yu wear them.
i think but SUCH retards on main sub??
fsir enough.
I FOUND SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE
has pixel
sent you spongebob licking gallicas ass today
yes but i realized
p3 characters weae them
and my haircut is already close enough to yus
what
i think i was still in post p3 depression dont judge me
that was november so
october
first time i bought a persona game was september 10th
i lost some bet so i had to buy p4 the next dsy
dementia patient
in august i only played slop and subnautica
i mid september i bought p4
start of october i bought p3 and p5 and started playing p3

zelda i cannot ever wear a light grey peacoat in bavaria

that is so unoriginal lmfao
slopschool
@ZeldaLord send me my steam link
of my profile
i found something
pin worthy in pjbw gc
look in gc
look zelda
its only an issue if you started to dress like that because you were inspired like persona
if you always have and its just a coincidence then its fine
dodging the question are we?
zelda its fine its a coincidence it becomes a problen if you wanted to dress like that because you thought it looked cool in persona
do you own
a light grey peacoat
WHAT
ok so what do u wear to school usually
the dodging is insane
remember the fat akechi and joker cosplay?
pixel is the joker
i heard drying ur hair is bad for ur hair
LMAO WHAT
its 3am
you have plenty time before school starts
what
why
ON A POST TITLED "whats the point of mitsurus bike"

i hate being called flochforster

miserable fucking cuck
this is like if you called a trans person by their deadname
i changed my fucking discord name and dont wanna associate with the previous one
can your thick antisocial serbian skull understand that
ur a cuck zelda
do u look like this irl zelda
i lowk thought u would
he looks very serbian
THE COINCIDENCE
the bottom vid is the 2 guys from an anime that i told u abt that are like ren and akechi and insanely likely inspirations (akechi even references light and apples)
@ZeldaLord im back to no seasoning

@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
NO THIS ISNT SOME PERSONA BULLSHIT
ITS GENUINELY OVER ME
@ZeldaLord
is it fucking true whats pixels saying
that someone made a "fursona" of me
oh ok
in reddit?
what
fyi
the status isnt about architecthor but the other french
because he completely betrayed me too
there might be
a SLIGHTLY comedic bug right now
look layer 2 leaderboards
look at uh
2-3 brutal leaderboard tr
any not p rank
a bit of rng involved but
maybe like sub 22 or 20 possible tr
@ZeldaLord how do you instakill a mindflayer?
4s to kill is
a bit too much dont you think
how could that be done faster?
howd you find it so fast andrej
got it by accident first time?
5-3 was insanely easy wtf
first try
lets see if leviathan is any harder on brutal
nope!
p2 too?
brutal is giga free excluding 3-2
even onion didnt do thjat..
NAH NOT THAT
yes
i dont want slop in my dms
more things than just ark can be slop zeldalord
i saw inside, i blocked
also tell him to go fuck himself the uty loss was insanely fucking funny
especially to someone who knows nothing about the game and randomly got it recommended
ok let me make a quick list real quick
of what i hate
1. hollow knight
2. france 
3. inside
4. serbian bacon fries
5. persona 5 graphics
theyre STUPID
i tried hk for 20 mins
i was in france for 2 weeks
i listened to 2 songs off inside
im never eating serbian bacon fries as im never going to serbia
i tried persona 5 graphics for THIRTY hours
yeah the worst one
unironically worst one
is it ACTUALLY funny though
my brother in christ hollow knight sold like 7m copies and there is 60 million french people in france
ig ill listen to it on the bus tmr its only 1.5h sooo
oh that makes
way more sense
fucking 1h 27
the cursed number...
at least it isnt 1h 39
@ZeldaLord i looked up inside on reddit to see what its even about
first results for "inside" is 38492973493 porn posts
its blurred but how do i disable it alltogether
no i put it in reddit search
i forgot his name
anyway
considering this is from 2021
its very obvious the main theme will be about the lockdown and shit
zelda genuinely what do you expect
im not the best at using the search feature
refer to - "shirt with shit on it" incident
who is
m3 reference
what if yoru was powered by green
LMFAO
IN THE COMMENTS THERES THIS
im going to stone this nigger to death
ok so
you have every right to call me out on this but
he has an accountshare for cheating kuudra
therefore
ok im a greedy fuck there is genuinely no hope for me
i am a complete slave to my greed and sunk cost fallacy
I DO NOT CARE ZELDALORD
I AM MAXING XP ON THIS ACCOUNT
if i get wiped im just killing myself its fine
no zelda you wont get anything funny
im just deleting all of my discord accounts
and if you message me on steam ill block you
HOW WOULD I CRAWL BACK WITHOUT THE ACCOUNT
if i get wiped theres literally nothing i can do at that point
except give up on the game
subconsciously
im probably do ing this to eventually free myself from pexblock
because why otherwise would i be carrying on with this being completely self aware of how retarded and wrong it is
im not
💀
look if were being honest its obvious that its the only way out
ok there might have been some misunderstanding regarding this on my part
i literally cannot imagine why to even do anything online if skyblock doesnt exist
and with that i mean other games
the game is utter shit and playing it is miserable but idk
i hate the french kys kys kys kys kys
hang urself serb
youre wrong but also right
it was fine until the ban
and its not just about the ban
chain of unfortunate events in a ssort timeframe
but im not a fucking serbfag who cares its fine ☠️
im not a miserable crnjinious prime
the correct metaphor would be
a drug addict longing for their drugs
not "le edgy le depressed because no pexblock"
what even was it
as i said my retarded ass was accidentally starving myself so i had no energy for anything
after i got a food scale and started cutting properly it was fine
i hate humanity is horribly out of context
i just despise all people online
dont have negative experiences irl
uhh i was tired or smt prob
its fine only 14d left
i can happily play my slop then
do you have blue waffle disease
ark :brown_drool:
u have ark right
ok so
u dont even gotta buy a dlc

@ZeldaLord its genuinely over

VERY VERY HORRIBLE UNFORTUNATELY TIMED CIRCUMSTANCES
I NEED AN ACCSHARE ASAP
FOR 6 WEEKS
forward to gc/pj if anyone wants to work on my account
80/20 split of the money made
for 6 weeks not permanently tho
architecthor cannot play for 6 weeks
and were 8b in debt and need a item that costs 8b
OK SO
WE TOOK A 8B LOAN FOR CLOVER HELMET
AND THE NEXT DAY WERE BANNED
🤭
@ZeldaLord you want cool skins right
do some easy task like flipping on my account
and you get 20% of the profits
you will be able to buy so many cool skins
because 20% of 16b is a lot of money
is this french
george droyd amogus pex
idk
@ZeldaLord
THIS IS NOT FUCKING REAL
MY WHOLE SCREEN JUST FLASHED GREEN FOR A SECOND
MY PC IS POWERED BY GREEN
onion did not respond
which is tragic
im probably just giving up on skyblock atp
everything going way too wrong
hed make irl money off it sooo
hed probably work for a low wage
because poland
bad sotuation right now ok.
need 16b
8b debt and 8b for an item i need before a certain update drops thatll make it skyrocket
whats an expression french people use for good food

isnt it beatiful?
literally subnautica aesthetic
your own mindset is pushing you away from experiencing peak
zelda try it and youll love it so much
grave of the lost = lost river
its subnautica bro
just play it
ur such a hater
yk its pretty sad how i dont have a megalo breeding pair yet while i already have all the 18 saddles crafted
@ZeldaLord im actually done
i got to the boss and it spawned 2 bosses and like 4 tentacles per 1 tentacle
and it also made parts of the boss invincible
im fucking done with this buggy shitfuck of a game
@ZeldaLord i somehow locked in and won but im still insanely fucking mad
you do realize i would be completely outcasted by society if i talked to anyone about ark irl
my friends only play fucking mobile games
and some console shit
and console ark is sloppy
@ZeldaLord theyre releasing a new story dlc in the extremely buggy hard to run remake of ark
evil business practice but i am doing everything in my power to get a better pc now
anyway that aside how much dyt my current could sell for?
and is it better to sell the cpu gpu and mobo or sell the pc and buy a whole new one?
zelda im not bothering you with ""slop""
im asking for advice
is it more cost efficient to replace parts or sell the pc alltogether
its like an abusive relationship taht i have with ark
just ignore it
yeah its gonna explode if i run the ark remake on it
not instantly
but when that dlc releases
i really wanna play it
not a fucking 4090 goon pc but something that can run it on non potato graphics
hey this pc was money i saved up
even had to sell my 2nd monitor
but since i just got birthday money and christmas money
i can cook on new pc
well christmas is in 2w but sakme shit
ur acting like im using the pc to hack chingping china pexlex servers
im just playing a hated videogame thats not even controversial for anything but being buggy as fuck
so
disregarding ark
is it better to replace parts and sell them or sell the pc
holy fuck
ur acting like im pedophile hitler for playing a buggy dinosaur game
fuck you and pixel were right ice cream is kinda good
this mint ice cream is so good
its fine tho ill do a 1h run at 5am to burn the calories
wait is this real lmfao
did pixel see it yet
what is a "silkpost"
i just got this randomly recommended idk hk slang
@ZeldaLord fuck this buggy game the 150 mana i was taming fucking disappeared
@ZeldaLord ark winter event you should totally come play!!!
they added france to ark lore im playing portal
how bad is it if im taking whats probably horrible design as intentional choices to make sense in the lore
ark lore made me more depressed than p3 did
is portal just fun puzzle game with no existential dread
i should play that to clear my mind
why did you just recently replay it
should be a fun short game
nice fucking caps
i thought you were copypasting this but ig not
wait black mesa is in portal??
wait is portal and hl in same universe
or are you yapping about hl

they literally made ark subnautica
you also go deeper and deeper all the time too because its a cave
you need to play it
its so peak
why so arkious? why so arkious? why so arkious? why so arkious? why so arkious? why so arkious? why so arkious? why so arkious? why so arkious?
rockwell is.. TOMORROW!!!!!
pray that i find a 150 megalo
i wanna do rockwell today
short interruption from peak fiction
ark is the best piece of gaming or any media ever created and im dying on this hill
this is so peak holy shit
extinction was SO worth the wait
omg zelda the main menu music is so good
i love extinction ^-^
come play with us pookie bear >.<
thats rude :c
we should play extinction together it would be so funsies zeldie :3c

5. tried to rat me
why do u need a new one
how
HE DID WHAT
HE NEEDS TO BE SKINNED ALIVE
how do u still have nw then
"death penalty is cruel and unjust and every human life has worth"
zaktabyte:
btw is the hyp and ur other new stuff all soulbound?
i had like 300% more ratters trying to rat me before i apid off and soulbounded 90% of stuff
having stuff soulbound is actually rlly important
if its an item you need for many things, like sos flare or term
soulbound it
if its a gimmick item like a tactical insertion or precursor eye or rend terminator which are based off bugs, dont soulbound it
wait when you said zaktic behavior
does that mean zak was a cheater YET STILL BEGGED FOR MONEY???????
LMFAO
TAXED
gg!
thats more than enough
tell dwagoon to f7
i asked him and he blocked me lmfao
👷‍♂️
prob no
so u had 8b nw but under 800 mp?

everyone is part of it. this is a zaktic psyop. talk to anyone, they will speak lobotomy kaisen. zaktabyte said nah, id convince the whole world to psyop zelda.
nah, theyre frauds
HEY I SENT THAT ONE TO DWAGON
its gojover.
ill never forget you zeldalord
dwagoon said to ndld:"throughout heaven and earth I alone am the gregic one" and then he psyopped the shit out of him
chaos filler replied:"This truly was our OHD" and bit dwagoon to death with his kuudra mandible
after being revived by dreammasterxxl dwagoon confronted zeldalord 
pixelated face asked dwagoon "you think you can greg?" dwagoon replied:"Nah id wait"
"stand proud you can draw furry porn" dwagoon answered after being asked by kuri why he made their petrochem unavailable for a few minutes
"stand proud you can draw furry porn" dwagoon answered after being asked by kuri why he made their petrochem unavailable for a few minutes
flochforster told carrot "even lobotomites cry"
just before finishing zeldalord off dwagoon thought to himself "nah id win nah id win nah id win nah id win nah id win nah id win" but then a single thought entered his head: BUT THATS HOW WAFFLES THINK
embrace the lobotomy already
there is no escape
its gojover
zak created the psyop
its so rude of you to ghost
he wants to have a discussion and you are ignoring him??
i love pixel
nah youd lose
nah, youd lose
are you telling me zaktabyte couldve ended it right here???? with strong session id logger???
Floch then opened his domain, Infinite Lobotomy
The domain's sure hit effect hit ZeldaLord
But thats how.. waffles think!
Floch, Mastersilly and Zaktabyte have brought out 120% of their potential!
But thats how.. waffles think!
embrace the lobotomy
it ends
stand proud zeldalord, it is over.
i dont even know what that means btw
nah, id guess
nah, you will
its not gonna end until you are spamming nah id win everywbere in all caps
repeat after me
n-a-h i-d w-i-n
nah id win
nah, wed troll
lobotomy
nah id lobotomize
it wont end until you go completely insane
and spread the lobotomy yourself
LMFAO THIS SHIT IS STILL HAPPENING??
thats prob mastersilly
We want to win
nah wed win
would you lose?
say nah id win.
spam me with nah id win.
embrace the lobotomy or it will never end
if all of us are spamming you at the same time, it might cause you some trouble, but would you lose?
# WOULD. YOU. LOSE????
nah, youd lose
would you win or lose?
throughout lobotomy and kaisen, i alone am the retarded one
blame dwagon
he introduced me to lobotomy kaisen in july 2023
no, zak is
this is a zaktic psyop
zaktabyte alone, is the psyoping one
google nah id win
rude to not anwser.
not nice!
we will stop just tell us would you win or lose
to find out if you would win or lose
so zeldalord, would you lose?
say the fucking line
do you not want peace
asking again, would you lose?
would you lose?
huh you really dont want it to end
that doesnt tell me if youd win tho
would you lose?
would you lose or win?
stand ashamed, you are weak
WHAT THE HELL
PIXEL ISNT EVEN IN ON THIS
hes not even in on this
idk why hes doing it
to make you say nah id win
say it
100 times
yes
do it
me and benny are sacrificing your soul to bring gojo back from the dead
you need to say nah id win 100 times
who is nebulaez
its so hard to imagine what you think of all this
you have zero context
this isnt mindless spamming theres an actual meaning behind it
are you nah id win because you always bet on hakari or do you always bet on hakari because you are nah id win
LMFAO
weve earned it already
just say nah id win
and it ends
doesnt hurt to try
i will get 10000 people to spam nah id win
send it just one time and it ends
, I'd win.
you have no way of knowing of who is truly behind this
but its not me or dwagon
benny would be never go this far on his own
neither would i
youd never suspect who it is
oh right you dont get the reference
how tho
i could ask a random person on the street and theyd get it
are you a waffle because you are zeldalord or are you zeldalord because you are a waffle
stand ashamed, you are a fraud
i need to sleep, my final words are
With this treasure I summon, zaktabyte's rat.
nah, id win
its genuinely so funny saying all this shit to someone who has zero clue
literally google nah id win
did that actually happen
ok i did not know he was that mentally ill
do you have a screenshot
has he ever said are you x because you are y or are you y because you are x
or with this treasure i summon x
or stand proud x, you are y
ok wow
thats way too far
nah id win
has he ever said nah id adapt
has he ever said jogoat
what about gojover
what about but thats how x think!
ok hes more mentally ill than i thought
has he ever said "wuji himtadori" or "wuta goatkkotsu" or "king of frauds" or "kashemo" or "farmer"
yes farmer
or farmer kashimo
has he ever said king of frauds
what about mahoraga
my glorious jogoat
he stood proud because he was strong
nah, he won
throughout lobotomy and kaisen i alone am the braindead one
activate (**nah id win**)dows

# NAH, ID WIN!

We will cut you in half with Strong Lobotomy
You did well, ZeldaLord1.
I wont forget you for as long as I live.
# Nah, I'd be the one who left it all up front the ashamed one.
It was a near impossible technique to pull off.
But as long as your sanity existed in that same space, same area, same DM it meant nothing to my Strong Lobotomy.
Stand proud ZeldaLord1, you are strong.
NAH ID YAP

# Dwagoon sagte zu NDLD: "Im ganzen Himmel und auf Erden bin ich allein der Gregische" und dann hat er die Scheiße aus ihm herausgeblasen 
# Der Chaos-Filler antwortete: "Das war wirklich unser OHD" und biss Dwagoon mit seinem Kuudra-Unterkiefer zu Tode
# Nachdem Dwagoon von DreammasterXXL wiederbelebt wurde, stellte er sich Zeldalord 
# Das verpixelte Gesicht fragte Dwagoon: "Glaubst du, du kannst Greg?" Dwagoon antwortete: "Nein, ich warte."
# "Sei stolz, du kannst pelzige Pornos zeichnen", antwortete Dwagoon, nachdem er von Kuri gefragt wurde, warum er ihren Petrochem für ein paar Tage nicht verfügbar gemacht hat Flochforster erzählte # # # Carrot: "Sogar Lobotomiten weinen"
# Kurz bevor er Zeldalord mit Zeldalord fertig war, dachte Dwagoon bei sich: "No id win no id win no id win no id win no id win", aber dann schoss ihm ein einziger Gedanke durch den Kopf: ABER SO DENKEN # # WAFFELN

that cat will kill you with Strong Cleave
Its intended target wasnt just you, ZeldaLord, but space, the entire world, existence itself...
Your sanity meant nothing as long it existed within that space - that world - it would all be torn apart.
It was a near impossible technique to pull off. But that model proved to be quite effective.
You did well, Zeldalord.
I won't forget you for as long as I live.
you didnt
he faked that to scam dwagon
Started a call that lasted 3 minutes.
i was told to call you
💀
mastersilly
Activate Nah, I'd win-dows.
remember when you asked me what the goal was?
this is the goal
to make you embrace lobotomy kaisen
until you are as retarded as me and dwagon it shall never end
i wont.
ill explain lobotomy kaisen to you
and you WILL be addicted to it
this.
this is the goal.
you will be scrolling on yt or reddit
you will see nah id win
and you WILL laugh.
this is a very well known phenomenon
it was always there but only now you are noticing it
no, THIS is the goal
the 3d of spamming you were worth it
you wont ever forget this
you will always remember nah id win
throughout lobotomy and kaisen
i alone am the braindead one
he is too
he got me into this
hes worse than me
what i am doing to you
is what melk did to me in july
ITS A FUCKING QUOTE DUMBASS
nah id cook meth
idk let me ask him
dwagoon said to ndld:"throughout heaven and earth I alone am the gregic one" and then he psyopped the shit out of him
chaos filler replied:"This truly was our OHD" and bit dwagoon to death with his kuudra mandible
after being revived by dreammasterxxl dwagoon confronted zeldalord 
pixelated face asked dwagoon "you think you can greg?" dwagoon replied:"Nah id wait"
"stand proud you can draw furry porn" dwagoon answered after being asked by kuri why he made their petrochem unavailable for a few minutes
"stand proud you can draw furry porn" dwagoon answered after being asked by kuri why he made their petrochem unavailable for a few minutes
flochforster told carrot "even lobotomites cry"
just before finishing zeldalord off dwagoon thought to himself "nah id win nah id win nah id win nah id win nah id win nah id win" but then a single thought entered his head: BUT THATS HOW WAFFLES THINK

When God created the universe, he asked his son Uni: Who will win? Him or You? To which Uni replied: Well, if he opens his domain "Progenitor Core", it will cause problems for me. Would you lose? Nah, I'd win.
When MSI and Uni clashed in battle, MSI used his innate technique "Left Right", while it is active, everyone in MSI's line of sight must move according to his voice, left or right. But Uni activated his Domain, "Gaza Strip". Then MSI had to activate its Domain. The Uni Domain turned out to be stronger, he emerged victorious by destroying the Core with his Water Pistol. Then MSI asked: Are you the strongest because you are Uni, or are you Uni because you are the strongest? Then Uni answered: I am the strongest, because I am Велике Сисе! Throughout Heaven and Earth, I Alone Am The Strongest One!

Chapter begins with Yuta revealing that he copied Sukuna's CT by using the last remaining Sukuna finger
Both Yuji & Yuta engage in close level combat with Sukuna. Yuji is highly determined to end everything with this last chance. He even spits his blood at Sukuna's face as an attack. Yuji tells himself that this is the last chance to defeat Sukuna & bring back Megumi
Rika grabs hold of Sukuna & slams him down while Yuji lands a kick on Sukuna at the same time 
Sukuna realises that his CE output & control over Megumi's body has gotten pretty dull
To counterattack, Sukuna disables Hollow Wisker Basket & plans to unleash “World cutting slash” while trying to tank damage from Angel's Jacob ladder
But Yuji & Yuta has already predicted that Sukuna would make such plan. They try to tie up Sukuna hands while continuing to attack Sukuna
Yuta notices that Sukuna's slashes are getting weaker & decides to move closer towards Sukuna without fearing
Yuta cuts off one of Sukuna's arms & Yuji makes the blood which he had spit on Sukuna's face explode
Small flashback to Yuji narrating that souls can be basically be combined just a little but they will never become one, as per Yuki's notes. With that Yuji says he will surely wake up Megumi's soul
Hana adds that Angel's CT is a good match for Yuji's plan. The plan is to separate Sukuna & Megumi's soul & dull Sukuna's tuning with Megumi's body & hit him with Jacob ladder
While Rika & Yuji grabs hold of Sukuna's arms, Yuta activates Angels CT “Maxim Output: Jacob's Ladder” 
We can see Sukuna burnt crisp after receiving that attack
Yuji moves back & hits Sukuna with his soul attack punch while saying, “Wake up, Fushiguro”
Yuji had calculated everything precisely but Megumi's soul no longer had the will to live. Yuji sees Megumi repeatedly saying “I don't care anymore”
SUKUNA IMMEDIATELY HITS YUTA, RIKA & YUJI WITH WORLD CUTTING SLASH!!!
Narrator criticises Sukuna saying for falling for the surprise attack by Maki. It's a common practice among Jujutsu Sorcerers & a mediocre plan which could've been easily avoidable by Sukuna

# You're right, ZeldaLord. I'm you. I wanted to reject you, convince myself that you were wrong. But that doesn't matter now. I'm gonna lobotomize you. Even if you come back as another discord user, I'll lobotomize you. Change your name. Change your profile picture. I'll lobotomize you again. I don't need to find meaning or a reason. Maybe in a hundred years after my death, the meaning behind my actions will become apparent. In the grand scheme of things... I'm probably nothing more than a cog. But I'll keep lobotomizing waffles... for as long as I can. That's my role in all this.

relating to the japan lore
idfk

i hate you
i was watching yt on sm1s screenshare
and someone said he broke bad
and i started thinking about ur lobotomy

I SAID IM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT PIXEL DOES
NO
IDFK WHAT PIXEL DOES
NO

vravo bince
what is your opinion on the aslume
say jonkler without the n and l
:trol:
you said jonkler wrong, are you stupid??
LFAMOO
I DIDNT EXPECT IT
TO BE ON OKBC
omfg
yes probably
at least you dont know what it means
it would be 200x times worse then
benny is so retarded that he finds it extremely funny
the reason he said it 17 times before dying to the hole is because he would actually die and not win
i should get into greg
i would be so good
dont read any chapter
if you read just one chapter
it means pixel and dwagon win
how so
what did you tell the user catalystsilly
what did you send it
thats literally skyblock satan
all he does is scream slurs and annoy people

LMFAOOO
Started a call that lasted 0 minutes.
isnt "maps"that pedo thing
no idea why it fucking called odnt ask me
cancer prime
you will NEVER believe where i found a persona 4 reference
and im not telling you because pixel would make fun of me for 800 billion years if i did
would you be so nice to not tell any skyblock goons (includes the french fuck) that im on discord if they ask you
i wanna like disappear for a week or so im busy as hell with school and other shit anyway
zelda if that gets forwarded
im facing the skyblock variant of a cartel beheading
because noone else is retarded enough to slave away for money for me
its an 8b debt
im gonna get an airstrike and with that i mean massreported until im wiped
and if youre massreported 24/7 it doesnt really matter if youre full legit or no
ok but its a horrible way to go out
its so SO pathetic
a complete defeat
btw fun fact
if i get "randomly" wiped by one of u massreporting me
i get to blame someone else for massreporting me because he threatened that a bit ago
so i can fuck him up real bad with that
its fine
you guys stop being tormented and i dont get killed by the skyblock mob
good tradeoff i think
im so eepy
i cba deleting rn
remind me tmmr
zelda
think of something
that youd want
that i can provide
in exchange
:)
wait
add me to gc real quick
i just wanna tell something to pixel
the final bait
but the twist is that its the truth
wont have the same effect
i really want to speak to him one last time
you can directly leak to archi if i post anything weird dw
i just REALLY want to tell him something
@ZeldaLord
FUNERAL
FOR
THE
LIVING
LMAO did he
oneshot?
to clear up any super suspicions
anyway if it wasnt obvious
pixel is stupid
messaging architecthor
and looking in the dms
LMFAO I STILL GOT IT
i made the frenchie crash the fuck out in vc
over something i made up in 3 mins
and when i revealed it was bait he wouldnt believe it
im god
md goonsesh
never say that again
the closet is glass
the laith guy
not me and archi
hes in vc w us rn
forward this to pixel please
im making a reference noone will understand
less bait than just a reference
.
yes im directly quoting the goon now im lazy ok
im laughing tho
literally pixel
i was gonna leak something about architecthor
because he was speaking in a french accent in vc
but he stopped
this isnt bait or anything
what can i do to stay good friends with pixel
i really want us to be good friends how can i achieve that
? no
the bait was that there was no goon in the first place
im intentionally putting in red herrings because it embarasses me to talk about my feelings so openly
you probably know me and pixel best, what can i do for us to be friends again
whatd be a good start
can you do the bare minimum for me and please take a bit of your time to anwser
so no more baiting and shit then?
FYM BAIT
I DONT WANT TO BE IN A GC WITH SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE MY BEST FRIEND
AND NOW HE FUCKING HATES ME
AT LEAST IM GONNA MVOE ON
IF ME AND PIXEL CANT BE FRIENDS ANYMORE
youre the on efucking baiting me
youre just so insensitive in this situation
i want to make things right and you just fucking call it bait
people can change???
and thats exactly what i want to do???
i told you that already zelda
i was faking it
theres no other goon
"archie & co"
last dm
whats like a topic that interests pixel
that could bring us together if i talked about it in gc
he hates me so much right now and i really dont want that anymore
how can i convince him its not
and what the fuck would the bait even be?? oh no i want to play roblox with him and not have him despise me what a nefarious evil plan
i havent in quite a while no
that is way fucking different
to just wanting to have a healthy non toxic relationship
LOOK
i was lying so things wouldnt be even worse than they are
dont tell him
but i actually want to change
and if he knew i did that stupid shit 2d ago
id lose ANY credibility
and he was literally IN KUUDRA GANG WANTING TO LEAK SHIT
a server im not even in mind you
xtnctn has been dead for 2 weeks
wtf is the issue with that tho
??
when you give me a pjbw quote
dont u have all of the msaved.
ill prob be asleep
youre acting as if im sending that around everywhere
why would i
again
still rn?
it is
not letting me
join the vc
Started a call that lasted 3 minutes.
hey buddy
cheap bait
hes asleep
im deleting this account too
god doesnt use discord
lower your fucking voice when speaking to god you insignificant filthy cockroach
anyway tho
i got bored of you guys
and baiting in general
readd me when i have nothing to do
as you can see from the lack of bait in the past few days
im really fucking bored
cba
i have irls for that
idrc i was still having fun
past few days it got boring
but acting normal was also boring
no just interacting with the gc is boring
the gc now is just souls games and GAMEJAMS AND PIXELS SLOP GAMES
no there is no common interests
.
i mean
only thing in pj i do is
bw and lethal
and noone ever gets on for lethal
anyway i propose an idea
7d in gc with no bait as a test
and if it works out
you help me with er and pixel helps me with hk
i want to do them but even when i play le game idfk what to do
hey when did you kick me and why
i was just about to go ask pixel and carrot
to start pjrarria
@ZeldaLord im having a brain hemorrhage
architecthor has the wonderful idea of coopadding someone who just got wiped for hardcheating who weve never spoken to and dont know much
and he says he completely trusts him with the entire coop

tell dwagoon to fucking kill himself
(i am not 24 its an  obvious joke)
💀
is dwagoon THAT stupid man
i am 63
(he would believe that)
im not 13 im 17
dwagoon is a fucking lobotomite
what hte fuck is zalgo
more material
ok so you see
one acc is for general use
the other for skyblock stuff
(this one is general use)
this is the og one
can you not message me on every account
the reason i deleted that account is completely unrelated to the ohd thing
i just realized now it looks like its connected
benny is so retarded 💔
(have you seen his panic attacks in boarpire)
i dont care about catalyst hes just insanely annoying
i accidentally deleted his lobotomy asylum channel once
but the screenshots still exist
bro what
is that benny
average benny
ive been planning to delete the account for months now related to something very seperate
its actually closer to 30
this is my original first account
i only used this, the skyblock account and 2 other alts the past year
i havent used them in years
idk why i made so many tbh
for most i dont even have the fucking login info anymore
accidentally logged into it
i only used it once.
so tell me how the fuck you found it
????????
how tf
lemonade cat is not me
that account im pretty sure i deleted
like in november
mental illness
ok but how does he know about ffloch
ok how the fuck does he of all people know that
no i didnt
i never did
no
no
its like completely unrelated to skyblock shit connected to THIS account
oh thats a completely different thing then
its some nolifes from cowshed that cant rly do anything
you have not seen the sircat drama
they harassed him for accussations of transphobia (he was not transphobic)
then got all of his friends banned (none of us were transphobic)
now they still harass us
*girl
but god is she insufferable oh my fucking god
gwen doesnt make essays, cato does
cato is skyblock hitler
eh both are
catalyst is annoying, cato is evil and manipulative and probably a pedo
AHAHAHAHA
WHAT A CLASSIC
I ALWAYS CRACK UP READING IT
someone without a life
i think its either gwen or cato, dont rememver
nah the writing style is prob catos
zelda cowshed is a horrible server never become active
its just meowing, making jokes about pissing on cats and barely disguised fetishes
CATO MADE LIKE 3 ESSAYS ABOUT THE KKK
REGARDING DISCORD DRAMA
aware
its cato
cato writes about the kkk
*herself
kill yourself transphobic filth!!!!!!!!!11
im telling cowshed mods to ban you
everywhere
im just making a gwen impression
.
before cato joined
cowshed was a normal and good server
i liked it there
november
yes
except they talk about eating eachother too
idt hes banned he just saw how horrible it is
and deranged
sb updates and leaks is the bad channel
general is dead

KENDRICK DROPPED GO LSITEN
@ZeldaLord i never considered this
i tried to completely cut off france nword yesterday
but apparently he has a ton of blackmail
from ark vc clips
that make me sound like the most retarded being known to man
??? the fuck
its top 3 kendrick
send me what lyrics carrot sent
IT SHOULD BECAUSE IT IS PEAK
KENDRICK IS THE GOAT
zeldalord are you a tiktoker
or can you
have an attention span
if you have an attention span then lets vc and i will explain all of the kendrick lore
no you really should
kendrick is the best artist
ever
the song is good
for kendrick the lyrics and songs are good
tv off
Kendrick Lamar · GNX · Song · 2024
at least listen to this fully
before making any statements
have you listneed
isnt it beatiful
aoty easily
oh yea zelda
he just randomly released it
no promo whatsoever
so funny
heart pt. 6
Kendrick Lamar · GNX · Song · 2024
this one too
its second best on the album
the second one
is a fraud
kendrick has his series of songs titled the heart and it was 5 parts
and then this retard makes a "the heart part 6" which was a diss
during the drake and kendrick rap battle
and now kendrick made the real heart part 6
?
yes zeldalord
kendricks songs have actual meaning isnt that crazy
wow guess who stayed up all night to analyze this album!??!??!?!?!
no he was
kendrick is not travis
travis just spits random shit kendrick puts thought into it
he literally released the album
6 months 16 days after his drake diss 6 16 in la
and that song youre referencing he teased in his last drake diss not like us
i havent even seen people bring it up yet
i was just looking for anything i could find and stumbled across that
all his shit is known for extremely deep meanings tho
your video game ost gooner ass wouldnt get it
its ok
like you just hate to hate without trying to understand shit
am i not allowed to enjoy my favorite music
no zeldalord how bad is your memory?
if i make schizo theories and overanalyze persona and ark what would make you think i wouldnt do the same for music???
you are like the brit, zeldalord
pulls up some unreleased travis song and goes: "how is kendrick yapping about some poem in the most monotone voice possible better than this"
spooky the kuudra gang admin
aka my boyfriend soon to be husband
@ZeldaLord guess who his favorite artist is
what screenshot
which one zelda
what one
anyway zeldalord
unblock me on my main
ill stop shilling ark ive given up on it
im beating all maps solo like the sigma i am
i hate all of you
?
thats three images
second one looks nicer
id call you retarded but im also gonna spend a lot on some "magnetic" keyboard because i have a ton of money to waste but its not enough money to buy a 4080ti
4080ti is the min requirement for the new ark game
he says faggot like 9 times in one song btw
how much is a ryzen 9
cpu
tell me
bro pls
some good ryzen 9 cpu and a 4080ti
should make me able to run ark
thats minimum requirements for the lowest graphics zeldalord.
not even 4090 can run best graphics idt
or not consistently
4080ti should still be goated graphics tho
@ZeldaLord how much is a ryzen 9 cpu
oh fuck
i need
new monitor
new cpu
new gpu
for ark
@ZeldaLord i dont even think you can consistently do 60fps with max graphics on 4090
yes idk shit about pcs
explain it
look it up
its just
theyre not the best with optimization
or bugs
or combat balancing
ok a lot could be better but its still peak and best game
Epic settings at 1080p: With the graphics of Ark: Survival Ascended cranked to their maximum values, even at 1080p the RTX 4090's performance divebombs, only hitting 60 FPS on occasion. The game should remain playable on the RX 7900 XTX, RTX 4080, and RX 7900 XT, so long as you don't mind a target of 30 FPS.
idk all of the ark development shit is pretty messy
early access.
zeldalord learns to read
there will be one soon probably
all maps arent out yet so its ifne
everything in ark is delayed.
the map APPARENTLY releasing in decembr
is the 4th map
and theres 6 canon maps not to mention the 6 non canon maps
ID RATHER HANG MYSELF THAN EVER WEAR THAT LMFAO
the color
i would rather take it up the ass
than ever wear that
no joke
IS THIS A PLOT TO MAKE ME KILL MYSELF
this is an outfit for gruncles
.
what 17 year old wears this
zelda if you dress like that
main offender is whatever the fuck hes wearing on his feet
i have a feeling you dress like this
if you do
rethink everything
the weird asf pants and whatever hes wearing under the sweater
yeah they suck
who wears that
middle aged fatties?

Miserable?
I was Miserable once
They locked me in a room
a rex breeding room
a rex breeding room with rex eggs

@ZeldaLord why can i not see the rot channel
Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.
The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.
The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.
@ZeldaLord should i turn into pixel but ark lore
i think that would be funny
ill be Pexelated_Face and talk about ark lore
this is canonically the strongest entity in ark
@ZeldaLord Woul you eat for 3 Doler?
woul you eat for 7 doler
woul you eat for 1 doler..
Changed the channel icon.
Changed the channel name: Extinction
carrot is this your cousin
Changed the channel icon.
robert
OK SORRY
@ZeldaLord can i send one ark image
just one
its so silly
its fine its not brainrot
i think zelda meant brainrot only
FUCK YOU
@ZeldaLord RAPE HIM
pixel i need to PACK MY SHIT FOR VACATION
can you not fucking downtime
and we do it AT THE TIME WE SAID
.
also im abt to do the final ark battle
and finish the game
and quit
and play p3r
out of 12 yea
but idt ill do any more for a bit
id rather not
cool!
why did they have to make the final boss of ark so fucking buggy
also its been 2 hours
no i wont
thats for workout and running only
im gonna add oneshot stuff to it
I HAVE COMPLETED ARK SURVIVAL EVOLVED
i have to pack
because vacation tmr
THE NEXT ARK MAP IS LITERALLY CARROT AND PIXELS HOME
ok so i just woke up and im more miserable than zelda
now that ive actually slept this is so tragic
i spent 150 extra hours to beat all ark bosses on hardest difficulty so id get 15 extra levels on my survivor character on all maps after and also keep all levels ive gotten on it
the bossfight was peak and all the pain was worth it and we just barely beat the final boss
then for the final thing which makes you get those 15 extra levels, ascending by going in some sphere
i successfully do that and download my survivor so i can use it on other maps
i respawn on the map and the opening cinematic crashes me
i reopen the game and my survivor character is fucking wiped
150 if not all 500 hours i spent on the map were for fucking nothing
i need game recommendations before i buy omori and fucking hang myself
THERE IS PROOF THAT I DID IT
WHY
yea i saw
it actually has good songs on it too
its pretty stupid ngl
you can like make a new character any time
and the 15 levels from ascending isnt player based
but character based
so are the other levels
nope
this wouldve better been spent playing p3 and p5 because i wouldve atleast fucking kept my progress
literally staring at a wall wouldve been more productive
literally the only thing i can do is make a new character and gigacheat through the final boss and get the 15 extra levels but that just increases my level cap from 105-120 and the 105 levels i got are fucking gone
i mean i have the achievement and thats fucking it
how
thats it im killing myself
i knew it was fucking buggy as shit BUT NOT THAT IT RAPES YOUR ENTIRE PROGRESS
also ive completely lost motivation even to restart on the next map because the next map is boring as shit
it has ZERO lore and ONE boss
like how can it get more fucking boring than that
the other 2 maps after that are apparently peak but im not gonna bother
how did pixel win
im still not buying his bs im actively looking for new stuff
i have a strong enough will to not fall into pixels shit
also ark is genuinely fucking retarded
you still need to ascend at lower levels killing easier bosses for all achievements
i thought ascending at highest difficulty would give all 3...
you know what the funny thing is
you have 3 bosses and the final boss
if you have the tributes from the highest difficulty all 3 bosses you can do any difficulty of the final boss not just the highest one but the lower 2 too
but for the achievement it doesnt work like that
it just forces you to replay it on an easier version
that was looking into the games from an outside perspective ignoring pixels bullshit
then pixel did so much brainrot i couldnt look at the games without thinking of pixels bullshit
are subnautica games also buggy as shit
with bugs that can rape 500 hours of progress
cant you just make backups every now and then
and isnt it still a way shorter game
ark you can either rollback 10 minutes or 10-50 hours the amount of hours being purely random
no my save didnt die
the stupid system in ark raped itself
i get the rewards of 15 extra levels for beating final boss, i respawn on og map, opening cinematic crashes me, i reopen my game, it tells me to make a new character and my old one is fucking gone
the fucking mastersilly guy will harass him
dont bring up shit
mastersilly is a fucking demon and when he first figured out i had an account share he harassed over 50 people from skyblock server "cowshed"
he is hellbent on figuring out and will leak it everywhere and harass 600 people
that was a furry porn server zelda
"cowshed 2" was a furry porn server
yes
what gif do you mean show me
i miss it so much..
ok so basically
he is french and 15 years old
i hope thats enough
send it
oh god this brings back memories
cowshed 2 is an extremely old thing too
like i joined cowshed 76 years ago and by then cowshed 2 had been deleted for centuries
probably subnautica?
also
first ark dlc is literally egypt
@Carrot
im coping and trying shit to get my shit back
zelda its not 15 levels
its also the 105 levels
i lsot the entire character
there are mantises in the desert
yes fuck you
im gonna go back to ark
list them then
and dont include brainrot
hes so cute :3
silly bunny!
actually no
pixel shouldnt see that
because thats very very very bad
FUCK YOU
@Pixel THIS YOUR FUCKING HOME???
dw like 50% of the map is a complete desert wasteland
the middle has some water and a few mountains
BETTER THAN P3R

why do rw and ark have so many similarities
@Pixel does rw also have an ascended ancient race creating the wherever the fuck you are in rain world area and humanity and earth are long extinct and fucked over and the game ends with you adcending
2015
i mean in ark its not extinct either its either people ascending into basically gods or dying out
HOLY SHIT LITERALLY ARK
i mean still right
@Pixel do like the itetators oversee the entire area where most of rw happens
like the pipes and shit
wtf
ark also has fucking ancient race of aliens
they sent the element meteor to earth
die
pexmaster22
Planets, species, even this universe we occupy. All of it has a limit. An end. You are approaching one right now.
Don't think of it as sand falling to the bottom of an hourglass, but the hourglass fading away completely. It can't be flipped around or reconstructed. It's irreversible. Permanent. If you want to stop it, you need to hurry.
That's not to belittle you. You've been doing great, really! All of you. Most of you. The ones getting eaten alive right now could be better, objectively speaking. The rest though? Great! You’ve advanced so far. Some through kindness, others cruelty, but both are aspects of humanity. Both are needed here on the brink, in the shadow of **Extinction**.
More than that, you'll need each other. You'll need help.
I should explain, shouldn't I? I mentioned the future, but I should have said "futures."
You see the universe, the whole of it, it's all math eventually. Everything has a value that feeds into an equation. You, the stars, the trees you assaulted for bundles of thatch - yes, I saw that. Very rude.
But back to math. The future's made of it too, or more specifically, probabilities. They twist and branch in all directions, so tangled that most beings can't sort through them. I can't even see it all, but I can find the most likely threads and follow them along.
After all, it’s just math.
mahoraga..
thats not ark tho
its unrelated brainrot
@ZeldaLord if pixel can send this can i not send my ark lore
ok who cares about adachi
ching chong

@Carrot do you have deathworms in the desert
carrot have you ever seen a wyvern in the area between the city and the desert

scorched earth and egypt are the same
uhhhhhh does ark have those lemme see
no it does not
you need to see the ark lore carrot
after i do my first solo playthrough
STOP SPOILING
no
i just know theres "Reapers"
what in the actual fuck.
on my 200$ laptop
surely right...
hex lex
im so funny hahshshsha pex hahahahaha
im going to kms
have you seen it
im not gooning im ON VACATION
im prob bsck in like
3-4d
have you properly researched it
ark has that too????
the 4th map is literally ruins of an advanced wiped out tech civilization on whats probably post extinction earth
and you have to kill what wiped out the civilization
while discovering the story
in ark during the extinction event, most people got wiped out but some ascended into basically gods that exist in a different plane of reality
i mean both ark and rainworld end with you ascending
the last ascended humans i  this reality are "the overseers" which are more ai than human at that point and oversee their respective arks
they were supposed to welcome you after meeting them and send you to earth to fight whatever killed humanity after beating your first ark, but after eons of noone defeating the things on earth, they began to fight you after meeting them and sending you to more and more arks which had conditions of the earth you are sent to
at some point, a group of survivors led by mainly helena walker and mei yin, hacked the system on abberation as they fully killed the overseer with a tek nuke and were able to send themselves and anyone whod come after them right into earth and not more and more arks
what they also developed was a way for every human to respawn through clones of themselves and data copied from their specimen implants
abberation was also fucked, as rockwell basically overdosed on alien goo and became a big fat monster trapped as the guardian of abberation
helena then after many years of being unable to stop what caused the extinction on earth, ascended into a higher lifeform basically god herself
she guides the player through a bit of explorer notes on every map from inside "The System"
i dont know the full lore of ark yet since i dont look at spoilers, but ascending in ark might be the same
my theory is that to ascend you have to let go of your main attachments to the physical world
for rockwell probably all his experiments on abberation and for helena probably mei yin
zeldalord is an ancient?
show
zz
skibidi backrooms
the 1$ steam game with a bitcoin miner

Download
BEWARE OF IMPOSTERS AND NASTY VIRUSES!!!

and when i go edit the clip i see notification from the gc called "Floch would go to a gay strip club for adachi"
in the clip.
@ZeldaLord read under
also read what he had before that
and what he says after
that would turn into something worse than pixel
far far worse
pixel but on fentanyl
@ZeldaLord did you like the week when i didnt have ark?
that would just get worse and worse the longer
good night ☺️😊😘🤗🤎
im abt to sleep

i just fucking woke up
shut the fuck up carrot
im gonna go do ark in like 20 mins
cures me of my adachi monster cock addiction

nothing related to adachi
i dm you shit instead of saying it here for a REASON, pixel
some things are too horrible for zelda to see
im a minor too its fine
mod that removes rise

ok maybe i am
but still
carrot do i send you an amazon link for the ssd i have?
its pretty good, after 2 months i still have 1.8tb left
@Carrot have you ever heard of the term "terabyte"?

working 9-5 sounds
miserable
im getting an actual job
i can probably finish ark before
i need to get a full time job
ill see
i am close to finishing hs without knowing anything about what ill do for a job
no, after college
ark just takes a TON of time to fully finish and since ill have a side job in college ill have like 2-3h/d for ark
maybe a bit less ill see
but i love ark
if i dont i am NOT doing a 9-5
i could probably live off my parents' money but thats also miserable as all fuck
because that just makes you reddit moderator
IDFK
YES I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA
competitive ark player
yes id rather be homeless than live off my parents' money
ark needs AT LEAST like a 1k+ pc for actual graphicw
i mean its not fucked YET
im still in hs
you mentioned playing ark on a laptop, zeldalord
to get me started will be some shitty part time job in college
then i get an actual non miserable job
after i finish college
no because its for 4 years not MY ENTIRE FUCKING CAREER
i want to go play ark but i wanna stay in bed
my life is a tragedy
do rw yap

@ZeldaLord i am missing 2.65$ to buy persona 4 give me 2.65$
i litetally had a dream that i started playing persona 4 and my skin became the same color as miserable zelda skin and started getting waffle patterns
IDFK
it was the silver hair guy with goggles selling cabbages to some guy who looked like adachi but wasnt adachi thats the most i remember
it was also all laughably bad quality
probably because my brain thinks its from like 1986
like the main character but he did not look similar to him at all
like the guy who shows on up on steam page of it
it was a 3ds
clpse enough
it was like one of those really fucking old bad quality 3d nintendo games
1986 was just comeeic exaggeration
but the game itself actually looked as old as that
uhh idk send some low quality games from like early 2000s
it was a small cabbage stand btw
on the street
and the not adachis walking animation was really poorly made
i mean this one had a pretty fucking obvious one
playing p4 makes you miserable
I LITERALLY STARTED TURNING INTO MISERABLE ZELDALORD MC SKIN IRL OK
thats how my retarded brain was telling me
p4 = le bad
no i wasnt even low on sleep
i slept like 7h+
would you not like to sell cabbages to a fake adachi
actually now that i put it this way its fucking miserable
its not the real adacher :(
NAH

4 30 fucktard
NO ITS A PIXEL EDIT

New to this series, is this game supposed to be serious?
So I decided to play Yakuza 0 because my friend says that the story is very good and it is very SERIOUS. But when Im playing the game, 1 minute ago Kiryu was framed for murder and then he suddenly teaches a girl how to be a good dominatrix? Is this revelant to the story at all?
And what the hell is a guy wearing underwear around the town humping?
Someone help me, I think Im lost here, is this game supposed to be weird or did I missed something?

i have no fucking idea what the image i sent was
because i completely turned off all images

i googled it and didnt see shit
how did this end up with zelda seeing it but not pixel
is there really no way to get pixel to block me
the punishment doesnt involve persona right
ok i will kill myself when someone tells me where to craft eye boss summoning thing
i tried both bench and anvil and i have 6 lenses
i know theres corruption in my world but where the fuck
will i eventually find it if i walk around
is it on the surface
is it on the left side because on my world icon its on the left side of the tree
im playing hollow knight right now
(walking simulator)
i put max size
it doesnt affect me i never saw it myself

As I've said, even digital creations are beyond my direct control. So it is with the System - these islands in the sky. I can speak with the the artificial minds that oversee their operations, but they have a will of their own. They too think, act and live.
So to change the system, my suggestions must be minuscule and their purpose masked. Incremental bits of code that are trivial alone, but substantial when whole. Thousands of puzzle pieces, scattered across these islands - these seeds in the sky - slowly coalescing and taking shape...
Until at last they formed you.
And what are you exactly? Once you break free, once you fall from the sky, I'll tell you your name. It will all make sense to you then.
I should explain, shouldn't I? I mentioned the future, but I should have said "futures."
You see the universe, the whole of it, it's all math eventually. Everything has a value that feeds into an equation. You, the stars, the trees you assaulted for bundles of thatch - yes, I saw that. Very rude.
But back to math. The future's made of it too, or more specifically, probabilities. They twist and branch in all directions, so tangled that most beings can't sort through them. I can't even see it all, but I can find the most likely threads and follow them along.
After all, it’s just math.
this is canonically the most powerful entity in ark
i went down the rabbit hole
ark is such an old game that it has so many facebook ahh memes
its so painful to look at them
zelda its a joke in the community

@Carrot
Anime luna II
Attack on Titan S3 OST - ətˈæk 0N tάɪtn ＜WMId＞
Music & Arrangement: Hiroyuki Sawano
Lyrics: Rie
Vocal: Eliana
 ətˈæk 0N tάɪtn (Attack on Titan)
Artwork by Jacob Noble : 
this is where music peaks
listen entirely
shut up zelda
i had 2 hornets in my room swarming a light once
yeah idk
i just have them saved
ok but @everyone listen to this please
youseebiggirltt?
that one is so fucking good
vogel im kafig is also really good and like an older version of it
hard to explain but
aot osts
some are very similar to eachother
what makes me most mad is how armin CONGRATULATES HIM
AND GLORIFIES IT
are you guys listening to peka
peak
yeah lmfao
lemme bring up some shit
ymir is the biggest cuck in history
what one
send
thats the one that plays in shiganshina when they start the raid
thats what i was referring to
TRUE
@ZeldaLord you are watching aot after jjk
ITS THE BEST ANIME EVER MADE
no
i need to buy p3p and rw already
kissed and hugged the head
and travelled overseas to bury it
also carrot dms
nvm doesnt let me dm
i wont say it cuz its too fucked up anyway
its ben related tho
no
no zelda
i planned on buying rw for a LONG time
i wouldve had it a while ago if pixel shut up about it
he literally made me not interested
were all playing it
so like
too broke
i spent too much money recently
dont open zeldalord ||the anime credits is literally 911 of paradis island its so funny bro||
carrot can jus
pirate itt
ill find him whre he can downlaod a pirated one even if he wants
mappa animators are zeldalord
i said not the game but WHERE HE CAN DOWNLOAD IT
jean is kinda a mc tho
one of the best characters
yea
my favorite is either erwin or zeke
eren had one of the best characters in all of anime
hes the most well written character in the manga you cant say hes not
and his entire philosophy and shit its just such an interesting viewpoint from the conditions he was subjected to and how it led to the events of the story and the betrayal of eren
and while some ending haters hate zekes conclusion i love it
it was such a good ending to his character
no.
i started watching when s3 p2 came out i watched the entire anime then read the entire manga and started following it
that was 5 FUCKING YEARS AGO
its been 3+ YEARS SINCE AOT ENDED
i meant to respond to this
ok but aot is peak
i love jjk but it can never top aot
@Carrot we need to force zelda to like aot
how do we pitch aot to him without spoiling anything
thats not a good start carrot
its far far better than jjk
jjk is just fights
the characters of aot are all so well written
the story is insane
like its such a good fucking anime you need to watc hit
he fumbled the final chapter
but the anime saves it
but tbh its immature asf to hate on him and the entire manga just for that
he made such a good fucking story with so many amazing characters
YO
IM DOWN TMR
I LOVE THAT GAMEMODE
I CAN DO IT 24/7
goonjamin
yea when are we doing it
also @ZeldaLord are you going to play as the woman
ill probably play as the woman because i dont like makoto for being emo
i have a 14d no ark streak
are you proud of me
why are pixel and carrot edating
yea cabbage
adachi was eating cabbage
i loved it
is adachi an emo kid
"nothing will ever change the world is fucked my soul is broken"
so theres this skyblock gc
"bonzo hideout"
and one of the black people there is an edgy self proclaimed sigma and hes also extremely transphobic racist and loves arguing
he also doesnt go to school because "social anxiety"
he also screams the nword in vc despite being the whitest kid ever
he calls himslef that
all the fucking time
and posts gifs like the following
why was an entire episode today just gay sex
i almost sent smt thatd doxx me instead of "freakdachi"
i love mobile
WHAT?????
FUCK ARE YOU SAYING ZELDALORD
fuck you zelda i wanyed to sleep
but you made me wanna play ark
:(
god is my entire life fucked if i ever touch anything addicting thats actually dangerous
its so hard to fight the urge to play ark
i need ark i need it back
what song is that
lyrics are rly familiar
yes
sukunas death was so fucking funny
i think so
ye
lets use spoilers to talk abt jjk from now on
||he doesnt||
||sukuna is just imprisoned as torture||
||you lost the game||
NO WAY
can someone threaten me with something im a pathetic fagger and want to play ark at 2 30 am
i can always just
not claim the gift
most sb players said far worse so no diff really
god i need ark back
i need the 185 poison wyvern egg back so bad

idrgaf as long as its not that one specific person
NOT MASTERSILLY
NEVER BRING UP MASTERSILLY AGAIN
I LEARNED MY LESSON GOOD FUCKING NIGHT NO ARK TODAY
mastersillys pure existence and living makes my blood boil
you try to find out who the annoying person is and bring up a person 5000x more annoying

@ZeldaLord
not even joking but
if i got p4 and adachi romance mod would u guys watch the stream
stop gooning and cumming
wwould pixel
watch that
@Carrot ask magnus
no
ask magnus if PIXEL WOULD WATCH IT
you IMBECILE
because pixel is DEAD
Am I stupid?
lets go ruin it in 40v40 because of hackers!
do u think pixelnwould
also zelda who is "akechi"?
is that adachis brother or smt
how does he look like
is he hot like adacher
he looks like
pixel would irl
you are jonkler and he is akechi
jonkler is like "wah wah society" aka miserable
and akechi looks like a gay schizophrenic which is literally pixel
EVEN MORE LIKE PIXEL!
whar
2 egyptians with a combined networth of 1 dollar
WHY IS MAGNUS HERE
also @ZeldaLord i returned to hypixel skyblock
i think this is worse than ark
i just logged off sb to go workout
then in like 1h 30 i can
i workout at home
do u expect me to go to the gym at 2 am.
i use 15kg i dont have anything else
besides 10kg which i use for lat raises reverse flys low dumbell flys
around 35 per set
this is pixel irl
does this look like it could kill a fly?
i need to get into coding so i can make a kuudra cheat mod but im too retarded to code :(
does pj still exist
who even talks there is ben there
a lot exist alreayd
but i like none of them
i need to perfect it myself
does benjamin still yap there
if so invite me
if i had magnus' name i could find pixel in 3 minutes
i found all of architecthors irl info off just face and first name
i could literally find some documentation of magnus winning that and thats all id need
i only care about pixel
i would mail him an adachi plushie
16 tunring 17
carrot is the only pedophile here
and pixel might become one
WAIT MAGNUS YOU NEVER SAW THESE DID YOU
WHAT
@ZeldaLord someone needs to protect the walmart kid from pixel
pixel is weirder
the screenshots pixel sent here
ask pixel what he thinks of goro akechi
im more retarded
consequences of talking to architecthor
pixel is worse
he supposedy sent me
adachis butthole in 4k
@Carrot 40v40 while we scream song lyrics like autistic down syndrome make a wish kids in 1h?
im still loyal to adachi
adacher <333333333333333333333
💀
carrot

@ZeldaLord i burned to death i quit
@ZeldaLord WHATS PAOSSWORD
wtf is this
what
am i cooked if im trying to get a drivers license just so i can go get back home faster to do like 1h more of ark per day
but tbh its either that or subnautica (very scary)
zelda x pixel in jonkler and akechi cosplay
wait
which p5 character is carrot?
we need a pj romance game
@Pixel cook
you can play as any character and romance any character (no minors ofc)
you and zelfa
arent zelda and pixel both 17
im 16 so its fine
you guys are literally older than me what
anyway if my fucking bus doesnt arrive within 10 minutes im buying a p4 key right here and then
zelda and carrot you could MAYBE make that argument for but not you
mine is like 30+ min late 😃
nigga what the fuck???
no carrot, its funny when i call you and pixel the nword because benny does it because he actually thinks ur black
@ZeldaLord OVER
OVER
ACTUALLY OVER
arent you egyptian
neand would do it for free
are you AFRICAN black or EGYPTIAN black
OK LET ME REPHRASE
MONKEY BLACK OR MIDDLE EASTERN BLACK
nah this is actually sad
carrot can you not like be white or somethibg
:(((
"i hate niggers!!!" 🤓
yes and im so happy
being white is an actual advantage in life although thats because of racism
ok i cba anymore
@Carrot what makes your anger trigger
@ZeldaLord would you kill yourself if i started acting like a skibidi brainrot kid
i want to annoy carrot as much as possible
???
why does pixel have to act so fucking gay holy shit
even if you arent stop
its not funny its just fucking aggravating to see
so shut the fuck up
no i love gay things
yas queen butt sex
is that a persona 3 the answer reference
if it is im killing myself
what the sigma?
you used mastersilly which is the only thing i give a shit about
like that does anything?
me and archis #1 opp made an admin investigate us and nothing happened
hey thats pixels job!
LMAO
bw and adachi anime
and p3p in like a week
last few times i didnt throw
we were getting targeted by everyone
EVERYONE
ask your parents for this
for your birthday
im discovering more things that make you mad
yes i want him mummified alive
your parents will think you are a furry
"for my 17th birthday i want a shirt of an 8 year old cat human"
you will be like locked up in a pyramid or something
@Carrot does egypt have graveyards yet or do you guys get buried in pyramids
IN FUCKING EGYPT????
?????
this is a lie
EGYPT HAS EDUCATION??
does anyone watch jjk
read manga?
in my primitive ahh bavarian school noone knows about anime except this uglyass emo hunchback girl
which always wears a DEATH NOTE HOODIE
kinda?
the same bitch got told to not wear wigs and black makeup 24/7
yes pixel
try to not imagine it
im scarred for life
GGGG
if i find pixel i will make his life hell
if i get magnus' first or last name i can get all of pixels info in under an hour
i just need documentation of the tennis shit
doxxing is actually easy tho
even a retard like me can do it
i just need first name and face/school and i have everything
i did it to architecthor and many others
yea no shit
just first name and face
address is kinda useless
last name barely helps
i dont even actually doxx people i just look up all irl shit for fun
ive done one (1) face reveal in my life but noone found me
ive never given out any info not even like the city i live in
fuck you
each time i see you or architecthor mention school i get reminded i lose all of my freedom in a week
no more youtube no more ark no more skyblock just slaving away
its learn about something for one hour then just do that for 2 months
nah the people are chill its teachers who fucking suck
65 year old miserable hags putting out their frustrations on 16 year olds
its funny tho
i sound more miserable than even zelda
idk how
im not even a miserable person
in the slightest
is it also schorching hot?
like on ARK: Survival Evolved Scorched Earth DLC
average bus
my keyboard doesnt appear on google
thabks 300$ phone!
zelda do u not have ac in school
is that the one with the fucking frogs
?????
ghostpjng
another ghostping
also pixie
have you unspoilered the image in dms yet?
as i said
i have an image of it
AND YOU NEVER WILL GET IT
pixel
hes gay for akechi because he relates to him
(hes a gay schizo cuck)
famed WHAT's dogma
@ZeldaLord can you help me ruin his life
no im bothering with architecthors bullshti nr
ill check rn
@Pixel i think im able to get architecthor to listen to kimi no kiouku
the rot spreads further
@Pixel write a small reasoning that will make him listen to it
and ill send to him
im down too
i dont want to do subnautica (very scary)
shut up ur egyptian
ur projecting ur misery
KILL YOURSELF
i listen to real music too fucktard
YOU ARE THE PEDO
and maybe pixel
||your honor, seven year olds dont have a cock as massive as that||
spoilering so zelda doesnt have to see
wait im gonna go further in dms with carrot
i feel bad for zelda
there are 2 factors here carrot
architecthor and not playing ark
thats what makes me miserable
miserable?
i was miserable once
they put me in a room
a hotel room
a hotel room without ark
and the lack of ark made me crazy
my life doesnt suck tho
im enjoying life way more this past year
"wah wah ark is miserable" well i love it
i was too
it was 3 am and architecthor forced me to
he has blackmail on me
all my irl shit
LET ME EXPLAIN BETTER ZELDA
ARK IS LIKE AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP
WHICH I KEEP COMING BACK TO
its a bit enjoyable sometimes ok
ok ill list some things i do that arent miserable
ok i
run 3d/w
workout 6d/w
watch silly cats on youtube
that isnt miserable
i got some fun memories out of it!
it wasnt all that bad
it was a bit enjoyable the entire 500 hour journey!
little do you know of the gay black porn and adachi porn i sent to pixel when he had discord embeds off
it wasnt really
its more like an adult version of a child character
its shock value
pixel tormented me for weeks and i wanted REVENGE
you knkw
all my latest ragebait doesnt go well
ill buy a new pc so flochforster tech support v2 can happen
ok but ill stream any game
what part is most annoying to replace
i hope its storage cuz if i ever plan on playing all ark dlcs i need more storage
just block me
like ??
i wanna watch adachi anime and jjk here
thats miserable
ok carrot what would you want to stop being my #1 hater
what should i improve
💀
its 1 dolla ryou can afford it
whats hard then
ly2 carro
also wheb 40v40
i wont spend money on anyone here
make them happen??
we still dont have zeldalord jjk stream
also i wanna do bw
ill stop complaining about iron and shit
and just defend
normally

WHAT AM I WITNESSING
MISERABLE
i want adachi to rail me
@Carrot Good Morning
wgat copium

Yes you fucking are
stop being a selfish jew
well you see i lied
BUY ME IT
now
zelda
ill meow and purr for you in vc if you buy me it
isnt it a week after too?
what does it take
zelda
you do not want to see a flochforster whos thirsting over rise more than pixel is over akechi
make the smarter choice
this is the fate that befalls you if you do not buy me world machine edition by october 6th
ITS 7 EUROS??
isnt it 3.5
zelda
for now it seems
that 7 dollars isnt worth it
but if you dont you will regret it so much
IM NOT WAITING THAT LONG
same
but im talking about how zelda will regret not spending those 7 dollars
when i potentially become #1 rise simp on october 6th
ok zeldalord
no threats
just know ill always be grateful and remember you buying me it <3
@Carrot we cook
@Pixel @ZeldaLord oh ur alive

no nsfw just a weird post from ok buddy persona
@ZeldaLord

Left the group.
we went from pex to rainworld to pixel thirsting over a gay schizo loser
is that the therapist
WHAT THE FUCK
when the schizophrenic poor egyptian gets money the world crumbles
man i WONDER which ones he wants
@Pixel do u at least have any good mitsuru emojis
@ZeldaLord "im not gay for akechi"
its onyl 3
ok lets watch jjk then
@Pixel make your pfp some animated persona shit
go all in with the schizo
ok its sane
pixel has a completely normal profile and when you meet him hes a complete gay schizo
persona emojis i can handle
but can you not post
cropped porn
i really hope that isnt the source image of that emoji.
?????
???????
why would you open something implied to be persona porn
why would you say what you will do are you stupid?
What the fuck
@ZeldaLord can you control pixel or something
@ZeldaLord send link
@Pixel
WHAT
?????
zelda its not worth checking if hes right or wrong
discord.gg/persona
WHY ISNT IT EMBEDDING
im on phone
doesnr wrkm
anyway pixel can you stop being downbad for akechi and be downbad for mitsuru so i have an excuse to be too
unlike akechi she actually looks good
ok time to stop gooning
YOURE DOWNBAD FOR A 2D SCHIZO GAY LOSER
i agree, but it is gay to say you want a plushie of someone to fuck
WHAT THE FUCK IS THE CONTEXT OF THIS @ZeldaLord
except instead of trainees its 2 schizo gay losers
ok well determine with one thibg
rate mitsuru out of 10
and where have you seen his thighs?
i dont think you get to see his thighs in the game, pixel
pixel lusting over akechis thighs
I DONT WANT TO REMEMBER
let me explain quickly
pixel wants to see akechis penis
hope that was clear!
WHY DID YOU ACTUALLY TRY TO
being the gay schizo loser he is
akechi probably has a 2 incher
where is carrot
i want jjk stream
then what will the stream be
jjk movie?
OH GOD OH FUCK OH NO
@Pixel im tired dm me something fucked up so i can stay awake
text tho NOT image

Untitled - Clipped with Medal.tv
Watch Untitled and millions of other Subnautica videos on Medal, the largest Game Clip Platform.
@ZeldaLord "You need to start going deeper"
look at the clip zeldalord
yes
immediately
cyclops is kinda awkward to move around in and massive
w a seamoth or a seaglide i can evade reapers quite easily
from personal experience they arent that scary
im just extremely afraid of them because miss silly kept crying about them in pga last year
@ZeldaLord the hill area with reapers and desert area with reapers
what important shit is there i wanna avoid as much as podsible
@ZeldaLord im about to sleep how do i get blood oil
im eepy
pixel how do i get blood oil
must be fucking miserable living with him
guys i just thought
how the fuck are crashfish not extinct
they literally kill themselves all the time
zelda why did you start typing the same time as i did
arent you supposed to be in school
@ZeldaLord oh yea do i go to blood kelp zone with cyclops or just seamoth
and how dangerous is it
i start tmr
and at 7 30
and its 1h there by bus
why does it start at 1pm???
france school is also retarded
they start at 8-11 have like a 1h break during the day to eat and then until 4-7
bavaria is relatively normal with 7 30 - 2 every day
so no bullshit
anyway
any leviathans in blood kelp zone?
well now that i discovered i can get rid of any consequences by abusing saves i will
but do i bring cyclops or just seamoth
i had a fucktard like that this summer
@Carrot i was sending benny a csm meme and i saw he sent me ymir porn

@Pixel if zeldalord doesnt show up in like 15 mins im gonna read akechi x joker fanfics
it has been 15 minutes.
im gonna read this tonight
i am in the endgame of subnautic
all mats for all last upgrades except kyanite and going into lava area
this is gonna sound weird but
im gonna buy persona 4 and play it until the end of the month then buy and play persona 3 reload
pixel you dont understand the comedic value of adachi to me
its not related to you even
the first time you posted adachi pixel
i realized what it was
and the memories came back
ive seen adachi many times before, pixel
i just didnt know his name
i cannot elaborate under what conditions but
adachi holds extreme comedic value to me for reasons i wont elaborate on
at first i thought it was an ace attorney character isnt that funny
HOW??
in 6 years
pixel
adachi or akechi
ok but he looks like a gay schizo loser
adachi looks hot as fuck
isnt it walking simulator
i can send a spoilered image in dms
accept f add
the image will be spoilered, pixel
every image i send you is always spoilered
gn pexico
im finishing subnautica tmr
what the fuck
what the fuck
i didnt read all of it but
why were pedophiles mentioned 80 times and carrot said hed go on a "grooming spree"
oh yea i never told you because you were fucking dead for 10 hours
i have all mats for the last upgrades just need kyanite
got all the shit with nickel and crystaline sulfur
theres a ghost at the green gas area with bones btw
how lethal is he
yea
the one in the green gas area with skeletal remains
@ZeldaLord
will he kill me if i try go past him
is there any important shit past him
zelda
i am there with my fucking prawn
the cyclops is at the entrance
above the dropdown to the massive skull
@ZeldaLord how does rig for silent running affect leviathans btw
zelda
you do know the ghost leviathans has eyes, right?
apparently it consumes power
12 times faster.
yea no im just going there with my prawn
wheres the entrance to lava shit btw
there are GHOST LEVIATHANS
if a ghost leviathan attacks me does that mean my cyclops and prawn are done for or do i have a decent chance at escaping
.
unlike with reapers i dont know much about how ghosts attack
i was fighting off a reaper at the island yesterday and it wasnt that bad
ghosts ive seen 3 times only and theyre massive and scary af
Pinned a message.

WHY IS EVERYONE HATING
then why is attack on titan there
GIVE IT A TRY???
travis is not good at lyrics zelda
the music is good tho!
carrot
listen to rodeo and utopia
the albums are so peak
his lyrics are not the best, zelda
ok but the other artists who i listen to are HIM at writing lyrics
kanye and kendrick are the goats at it
shut up seperate the art from the artist
hes a fucking retard but his 10+ year old music is goated
i dont support him at all
i jus like his old music
ok let me dumb it down
you can like hitlers old paintings while hating what he did and that doesnt make you a neo nazi
noone does but its an example
i dont support kanye but his old music is great
no those people are retarded
they still support him and even defend his garbage new music
I LOVE UNDER THE TREE
vultures 1 and 2 are the worst things ive heard all year
but the shit he put out 10+ years ago
i was about to list some but theyre all fucking goated
ok i can send you a song that has lyrics and deeper meaning if you wany

@ZeldaLord all fucking aeon personas are obtained from other aeon personas
@ZeldaLord is there anything that lets me see which 2 personas make what persona
so i dont have to go through all personas but just what i have
where exactly
i cant find
i cant ifnd it
@ZeldaLord recipe generator is only skills
where are the personas
YES??? I DID THAT BEFORE ASKING????
THERES 500 COMBINATIONS THAT CAN CREATE ONE FOR EACH FUCKING PERSONA
WHERE CAN I JUST PUT 2 PERSONAS AND IT TELLS ME WHAT ILL GET
oh ok
@ZeldaLord i cant make any priestess or aeon
what tf do i do now
@ZeldaLord too complicated can i beat the game without much fusion shit
i looked on the website alr i cant make any priestess or aeon with those
the personas avaliable to me i cant make a priestess or aeon with
i already figured it out
its just ten years of looking at the website
@ZeldaLord ok im making it
tell me what skills do choose
do they carry over post fusionn
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
@ZeldaLord do i even fuse or nah
does power/level/strength of the pissowner matter for the sl or JUST that its the right arcana
@ZeldaLord i can make either priestess or aeon what do i get first
@ZeldaLord WHAT THE FUCK
strength + char should be aeon as seen here
BUT I GET THIS??
fusing strength and chariot
to get aeon
because it says u get aeon from strength and chariot
wdym
explain
how tf am i supposed to get a priestess
AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IF ITS NOT STRENGTH + CHAR = AEON
EXPLAIN
I DID???
so strength + char + ? = aeon
whats the 3rd one
i do not have any of those!
@ZeldaLord i just killed the save to not do the fusion

@ZeldaLord what do cultural clubs do
WHATS
WITH
THE
PEDOPHILIA
IN THIS
GAME
actually fucking weird
LMFAO
LMFAOOFIKAOSJKDINWQMPLK
@ZeldaLord where can i find marie
@Pixel big mouth for my big cock :3
i clipped yukiko saying good boy
and im gonna listen to it to fall asleep every night
god i want to cum
floch
yukiko - Clipped with Medal.tv
Watch yukiko and millions of other Persona 4 videos on Medal, the largest Game Clip Platform.
@Pixel if u ever need
might aswell do @everyone
im gonna put that on loop and jerk off
i want yukiko to repeat that over and over as she pegs me
IM FUCKING CUMMING BRO
@Pixel thats a lot of yukiko!
no i need more pages of yukiko porn
9 isnt enough
@Pixel what did you want
also
f add me
i have dms of
f
@ZeldaLord what is he posting
im really scared
carrot
pixel made something horrible :(((
:((((((((((((
@Pixel gn my pixie wixie :33
gonna dream of yukiko bullying me and stepping on my balls then pissing all over me
no carrot i want to be the one groomed
i want yukiko to emotionally manipulate and abuse me for her own entertainment
pixel
what color do you think yukikos urine is
a clear transparent or shit brown
#1 i am 16
#2 while its extremely fucked up to send i am not fucking attracted to NIKO ONESHOT
have we dug too deep or not deep enough
what the FUCK is that
is that just the word for loli pedos
theres like 2 in skyblock community
theyre oathetic
i want yukikos piss DEEP down my throat
archie was one of those 2 retard
although hes 15 its kinda inexcuseable..
arent lolis young anime girls tho
that niko image wasnt young or anime
argue with mr architecthor if you want to i cba
you are right that its fucked up but we arent pedophiles???
are we retarded deranged and have a fucked up sense of humor?? yes 
do we like children?? no
no the cp wasnt humor the reaction of the people is the humor
like for any gore or gay porn
that shit isnt funny its funny how people react
did i say it does???
like i had to say 59 times for carrots retarded ass
IM NOT DEFENDING THAT WHAT I SENT ISNT WRONG IM DEFENDING THAT IM NOT A FUCKING PEDOPHILE AT 16 BECAUSE ME AND ARCHITECTHIR ARE RETARDED
doesnt that apply for actual irl material not for a non serious drawing
also i cant fucking believe im saying this and using these terms but, the text "you only have one shot" and the comically large proportions further indicate that it isnt meant to be something for people to actually jerk off to
i couldnt find a better way to say this shit mb
yes, but it doesnt make you a pedophile
??? FUCK YOU SAY
no thats fucked up?????
seeking out actual real life children is fucked up
pixel this is not the time for persona emojis
so you can be miserable
nah
but your argument of comparing actual cp made for pedophiles to watch compared to a obviously comical drawing depicting one character is just wrong
its so different
ok so do you think a single person jerked off to that niko drawing
do you
it happened once and i learned from my mistakes to not do it again
i dont have that horrible shit saved anywhere i just did copy image from when architecthor sent it to me
for if architecthor has it saved i honestly dont know and dont want to know
why do you think i would save that shit
i dont even save too bad of gifs
i just go to architrcthir dm pins and get them there
i dont live in serbia
why did i cause carrot a mental breakdown even the one time i wasnt ragebaiting
what the fuck are you feeling bad for
feel bad for architecthor hes 15 and thinks femboys shitting and cp is "funny"
archutecthor is NOT cool
hes fucking weird
literally because we account share
i have zero interest in talking to him once he stopped playing aek and started playing skyblock
i can explain the situatio fuether if u want its complicated
considered it many times but its my irl microsoft accoint
nah
let me explain
basically we merged accounts
i had like 45b he transferred like 12b
and he grinded like 20b while i grinded idk how muc
and now its a bit messy because we have 160b
and if i just removed his access hed get me banned from everywhere
ive been wanting to leave sb comm
but i dont want to be seen as a ratter
while he rarely does it hes good at manipulation he could definitely convince people into shit and lie ESPECIALLY if im not there
anyway im not defending what i did but i did realize how wrong it is and how fucked up all the shit we did was
theres still SOME people i like there
and funnily enough both me and architecthor are good friends with them
.
but im not removing access im not getting a shitty rep
no one of them is very sane
he even said hed block us if we sent him gay porn one more time
you think i havent tried lmfao?
"uhm the levels and cata levels and skill levels i grinded!!"
aka non transferrable shit
idgaf about the account or playing skyblock i havent since may
i just want all this to end
that doesnt
transfer 410 sb levels and 50 cata levels
no?
its a different account
no it doesnt
literally look it up
coop shares only collection and minions and garden milestones
and soulbound stuff
but how im handling it rn is fine id say
im not interacting with him much, not caring about the account and barelt interacting with sb community
doing what
that was back when we still regularly talked and play shit
rn i barely talk to him
only for important sb stuff like purchasing big things
anyway rn idc rly
im having fun just playing p4 and torturing pixel
just know carrot
ive learned from my mistakes and am managing pexblock shit rn fine
give one reason to change smt rn
what would be such a benefit
can you answer
i wanna sleep
carrot stop autism yap and answer me
i want to know if theres actually any reason to
pixel
did fucking up one day (doing sl with progress not there yet) ruin true ending
im on start of may yosuke 4 chie 2 athletes 2 band bitch 2
when can i even start it
i havent yet cuz i cant find her
wont that fuck up maxing all SLs and true ending
when is racism world on sale again
i kinda wanna try more and more shit now that ark is fading away
oh my god i didnt even mean to make the referenxe
i kinda wanna try more and more shit now that ark is just a distant memory
better?
yea no im sleeping
zelda when you read jjk
youre not reading past chapter 235
its peak until then then its a shitshow
@Pixel dojima gave me a swimsuit does that mean there will be a beach episode with yukiko in a bikini
@Carrot man what was i talking about yesterday????
@Carrot YOU WERE RIGHT
YOU WERE ACTUALLY RIGHT
I AM NOT HANDLING THIS SHIT FINE
EVEN NOW THAT I DONT PLAY HES FUCKING FORCING ME TO GRIND SHIT FOR THE ACCOUNT????????????
can he not just like
get arrested for being in possession of very weird shit
id get banned from everything
this is literally what i was talking to carrot about yesterday
not on these terms but
god is this shit miserable im prob better off
yea thats what i said
im not stupid
i used a burner email and burner password
yea
i removed everything from it
and added burner shit to it
carrot its not about that even
do you think its fair
for him to ask me to give him my account and remove my own access from it
when i dont even play
thats just giving in to what he wants
no he wants me to remove myself and give him full access of the microsoft acocunt if i understood correctly
i still use the account for non sb shit
he thinks hes entitled to the entire account because he grinded for 2 months where i didnt play at all
ignoring the fact i grinded a ton before accshare and during until may
"look at me im so sigma and edgy and have zero irl friends and play pexblock 24/7"
yea
but you cant ever fully erase everything off microsoft account
for example MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION
i removed it but theres no way to remove it from past purchases
giving him the account has never an option
and never will be
guys i think i raped my triceps
GUYS
WANNA BW IN AN HOUR

@ZeldaLord is a dungeon supposed to appear after moron dies
i always do it day one
i fucking hate deadlines and always get shit doen instantly
deadlines cause me stress
ohhh
makes sense ig
@ZeldaLord 1.5 more hours until school i can persona!!
@ZeldaLord i got a cropped lesbian porn thumbnail for some song with 90 views
is this the consequences of looping soul phrase for 2 hours?
594 yaps
yea
please show
"changing"
im not one of the retards who only listens to one type of music and doesnt want to listen to anything else
if its good ill listen to it i just need to get into it first
i only had prejudice towards persona songs because PIXEL
relatable
zelda is your school also retarded
and if a teacher doesnt show up it isnt a free hour but its just sitting there waiting
i am REALLY motivated to skip school tomorrow
because we had school until 4 30 and i just got home rn at 6 and my phone was dead all the time
and i want to kms
he probably does the same thing as i do
i just pretend im sick and cough a lot and pretend to blow my nose
last year during the biggest exam hell
we as an entire class strategized when to skip
and it never occured to my parents that i was conveniently feeling sick on some days with 50 exams
oh gg you have sissies who ruin everything
zelda do u also have a nigger that is the opp of the entire class and tries to be best friends with the teachers
i want to beat him to death with a dildo
zelda
is serbia normal or do you also have ART CLASS
i had to listen to so much art class yap today (my phone was dead)
i got it this year
its not as bad as biology and art class
listen csrrot if im interested in it i lock tf in
example: math, german (i need to learn how to speak german better), history, geography, chemistry, computer class (im not directly translating it)
i paid more attention to biology last time
only tjing i completely ignore is art class
because how can you expect anyone to take it seriously
mine are french italian then idfk what
WYM RNG
???
how is it rng
zelda does youe achool not let you choose what subjects you want
EVEN BAVARIA LETS YOU CHOOSE WHAT THE FUCK

Andrej du bist eine Schwuchtel

i am not joking
look at it yourself this isnt bait
zelda im not making this up
there is a possibility
your teacher likes gay ships
@ZeldaLord does she look like a normal 20 year old or a quirky miserable 20 year old
bro zelda
my school has at least 50 (real number) vaping emo bitches
i hope they all hang themselves or something the entire school is filled with that smell

are all english teachers outside us like that?
im in final year of hs and were being taught the most basic shit still
thats bavaria too tbf
they think were all retarded and english is some uncomprehensible shit to us
pixel whos your most insane teacher and why is it the biology teacher
all of my biology teachers since fucking middle school have been insane actually miserable 35y bitches
last years whined about her relationship problems
and had "bad days" whered shed take out all anger on us
i had one
i actually liked art when we had her she was the only good art teacher
is that why my only good art teacher was one who just started teaching and didnt realize how miserable of a career path it is....
what in the fucking cope
"i made a massive mistake PLEASE DO THE SAME MISTAKE"
???

why beef with him of all people
i think making MERCH is not the same as promoting UNHEALTHY FOOD TO CHILDREN
what do you expect on twitter.
the one good thing to come out of twitter
also is mrbeast even still relevant and shit
????
arent they marketing that to kids??
?????
GG
what the fuck are they cooking
why is this being marketed towqrds children
no this isnt an alternative its to get hundreds of millions of new kids addicted to this shit
least blatant lies
yea its extremely cheap per meal
i make all my food myself and its really cheap per meal
true
something you make for 2.5$ tastes better and is a way bigger portion than anything from a resteraunt
"its fine the romans drank lead so you should too in prime"
THAT CANNOT BE HEALTHY

@ZeldaLord got the first thing but shes acting likje i dont have it??
oh i just reentered
@ZeldaLord I GOT A FUCKING ACCIDENT FOR THE THING I NEEDED FOR SL 3
ok fusion isnt that bad
@Pixel It was inevitable.
KILL YOURSELF
jack frost was so popular they made a disney remake with a black actor
@ZeldaLord this is good right
i got it out of a fusion accident
so i assume its good
ngl i should do fusions earlier on in the other 2 games
kinda fun
yea
i used phoenix and matador
this metatron guy seems op af
anyway im free soon
it are over
@ZeldaLord I DIDNT GET MAX SL ACHIV???
oh

im so close zelda!!!
and zelda p3p
so like how did this happen
212 hours.
how time consuming is ng+ stuff tho zelda
i kinda wanna do it legit
like what
why quests
not even an achiv
in what game are quests most miserable in
@ZeldaLord GG MAX COMPENDIUM TROPHY IS NG+ LOCKED
@ZeldaLord
i just remembered
what the fuck is the thing in the velvet room dimension at the start of the game
first ever combat tutorial
who is that.
do i stay up all night to finish the game
should be fine
@ZeldaLord is valiant dance good
replaced divine grace with it because everything is a full heal anwyays
@ZeldaLord oh my god i was able to buy 4 soul food
whats ryugu stone btw
2
ive never used one
its just a full hp and sp heal
WAIT FULLY PARTY?
WHAT THE FUCK
DO THOSE EXIST IN OTHER GAMES
wow thats
op
i ignored items until today btw
how do u even obtain them i never noticed lmao
anyway zeldalord one
i realized that i didnt even need save editor
i finished books really fast which meant i had infinite time to use shrine
so i could do definitely have done all sls in time
for p3
i plan to do all quests and everything
ill also do very hard on both
whats the diff between merciless and normal in p3 btw
what was this btw i never did shit here
i cant afford 95% of stuff there
man i never even got to fight the reaper :(
anyway im gonna sleep prob
so just answer this
is marie stuff well done or just filler
i hope its well done because i really liked her sl
whats p5 reaper btw
also why were u guys so against me getting p4
its actually really good
@ZeldaLord LMAOOO
I WAS LOOKING UP
"WHAT IS P4 REAPER A REFERENCE TO"
yes
thats the point, zeldalord
isnt that sad
and miserable
she stopped being horny and had a good conclusion in her sl
also despite her being a slut i like her story and cjaracter arc
that one
scene during the drunk shit
actually made me want to quit
yes that made it worse zelda.
rise just sexually harasses you.
each time i go there
i will want to kill myself
snowflakes on the bus back from school during winter when its snowing and basically night will be SO FUCKING FIRE
@ZeldaLord u should do that too
my bavaria bus playlists are just random yt generated playlists
i wish i didnt know the osts of p3 and p5 before playing the game
because i never heard a single ost before playing p4 and discovering each one was so good
i hope theres banger ones in the dungeons
the fog monster theme was so fucking good man
how long would it be to 100% persona 3?
p4 only took me sub 100h
@ZeldaLord did they specifically design the game, the entire aesthetic, the story, the characters, the area it takes place in to be heavily nostalgic and memorable
because the entire small village in pexico, yapan vibe
yes
thats why i relate to the game so much
its especially nostalgic for me
WAIT THERES A BAVARIAN ADACHI SOMEWHERE
@ZeldaLord what do i replace
GG
why farm them tho
whats so good about them xp?
should i do that
on p4
do i do even yosuke chie teddie level 99
w reapers or
what dungeon then
how long u think itd take from 83 to 99
also THERES PEOPLE STILL DOING NANAKO SL ON 1/27 (pressing Z)
would it take over 5h or nah
?
are they needed for all achivs
@ZeldaLord how do i go shopping
ight i did
@ZeldaLord well this is it
spent the final days going to the hot springs and movies with the entire investigation team
spent the final evening with yukiko
ok gn
when do u have time tmr
i wont go to bavaria hell cuz sick most likely
bro thats when i workout
ill just do sb tmr and finish p4 saturday
nty noone wants it
what the fuck???
you dont just randomly see that, carrot
@ZeldaLord remember okbp suicide note?
we have this now
@Carrot "I still remenber us both texting into the AM about how ridiculous the AOT finale had gotten. So I knew then and there, I couldn't die."
aot is juet another manga mentioend in the post
its mostly about jjk
what if i dont 😈
also i want everyone to be rhere for it
@Pixel fix your FUCKING INTERNET
just do that
p3r is gonna be so fun :DD
and i loved p4
this is like
sorry to mention it but
when i finished the first ark map
in the final grinds i just wanted to be done with it
but when i did complete it and played the second map
i started to miss the first ark map
i feel like its gonna be same with p4 and p3
PLEASE NO
@Carrot lets shill aot to zelda
god has abandoned us
zelda is an abusrd wife for you too now i guess
are you officially joining the "pj polycule" whatever the fuck that is

carrot you dont know how much i wanted to kill myself during the adachi thing
it was NOT fucking funny
also @ZeldaLord how is someone supposed to pick adachi during that???
i only picked him first try because i had no idea
my #1 rule is if you have no idea always pick the funniest option

you said it same time in the gc but i was thinking the same

zelda
the weekend is meant for sleeping and sleeping only
i have 1-3 hours of free time a day then like 6h to sleep then school again
my schedule is the most painful thing ever
yea i was still sick so i decided to stay home and sleep 12 hours
zelda you dont understand how its like to have 0 free time until 5 30pm when ur home then u have to workout and shower so thats another 1h 30 then its fucking 7pm already and i have to sleep at 8 or 9 pm
nah im alr studying
i mostly study on the bus because thats more than 2 fucking hours
do you get 11 hours and have to wake uo at 4 30
9 hours then 2h is bus
becsuse im just studying there
i literally cant do everything i need to if i wake up at fucking 5 30 (1h later)
like 5 mins then i dry it for like 5 mins and do hair products for another 5 mins
ive arranged it in the most efficient way
the main issue is trying to fit a schedule that perfectly worked during summer into 11 hours of school
stfu i naturally have extremely straight hair so it looks kinda shit without hair products
what the fuck are you saying zelda
thats how i get 8h of sleep
since i workout 5d/w and run 3d/w i need to get a lot of rest
@ZeldaLord this nigger is gonna stop maining skyblock so he can do not ark but osu

german.
more of just writing than a test though
HOW DID HE
HES LITERALLY AUSTRIAN
listening to persona osts while slowly realizing i am slowly reaching the point of zero free time and permanent loss of sleep
im killing myself @ZeldaLord
6 tests next week they all got announced on the website TODAY
i have 2h to study on bus and like 2h to study at home
holy shit
shit got worse
archie got my irl name
what the fuck
my life is falling apart
@ZeldaLord yea its over
any plans of killing archie are over
ok this is fucking eorse than i thought
"man school sucks" I DIDNT WANT ONLINE SHIT TO BE EVEN WORSE
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord i need like advice on how to do this shit
i need to gaslight him very efficiently
nvm i fucked it up already
at the start
I WAS STRESSED OK
ITS UNSALVAGEABLE NOW
15 YEAR OLD FRENCH DEGEN HAS MY IRL NAME
AND I HAVE UNDER 30 MINUTES OF FREE TIME A DAY
anyway i cant rwally
he said hell just call me that everywhere when i pretended its not real
anyway
do i kill myself
ok i need to think this all through
because i fucked up so much trying to gaslight under stress
im makoto
@ZeldaLord he fucking accidentally screenshared accoutn details
i am so done
i am genuinely so fucking done with this retard
nvm it was on purpose he just doesnt care
if this shit is bait
then holy shti i need to get better at bait
zelda
i am having bigger fucking issues than you having AKECHI in your class
archie got my name it is literally over
i shouldve pulled the fucking trigger while i couldve
now i cant ever again
mojang bug logged both of us out of the account
he goes into login
the 2fa has 2 emails avaliable
the 2nd one has first 2 letters of my name
he guesses right first try.
well now its not
now it became impossible
zelda
you fucking RETARD
its my actual irl name
not some larp like crnjin
he also knows what i look like from a gc
he doesnt have the image but he could find my insta
i did
his response: ok ill just call you that everywhere then
bro
me and a friend did for final test of the year a math test this year
AND WE FUCKING WON!!!!
would be surprised if he didnt english is freest subject
zelda i might buy omori
because i do not give a single fuck about anthing anymre
everything is going to shit wouldnt it be funny if i became a depressed faggot
zelda
tis mostly about the
fact i
have 0 free time
and will be losing sleep permanently
yes considering i have all of archies irl info
i did
my life improved so much when i started doing 8h of sleep
yea
(its always miserable)
i really dont want to become zeldalord but it is inevitable
miserable bavaria hell student listening to persona ost on bus while studying
on 3h of sleep
im like
so far down the zero time to fucking breathe and zero sleep rabbit hole
that i need fucking persona osts to give me energy on the bus
it works tho
picture this zeldalord
actually i cba to yap
not from okbp
vnaya sent me
i should replay p4
zelda
is p5 less miserable than p3
no no not hte gameplay
just
knowing how it ends
and everything
is sad
i want something happy
p4 was happy
"ragequit"
how is that a ragequit
and i never said im not finishing it
just not rn
i need like a distraction from bavariah ell
and p4 is happy
theres stuff
in p4
which i never experienced
like diff personas
also p3 combat is so fun
you fight the boss a few times just to test stuff then you develop actual strategies
i felt SO sigma when i realized that its always the same pattern with clairvoyant relic
did you?
i wasnt listening
bro zelda my experience was just
10+ times trying to poison it
but it missed all times
so i gave up and did an actual strategy
im surprised he doesnt know
theres gonna be gay shit if i continue playing???????????????????
but it ends miserably :((((((((
im gonna be depressed as fuck when it ends
and unable to focus on studying
DONT REMIND ME OF GOJO AM I NOT MISERABLE ENOUGH ALREADY????????
thats because his death made no sense
the sad thing about makotos death is that its fitting and makes sense
its just
sad
i dont care about PLGBTQ 39
its not even an actual persoan game
the
pq thing
zelda
he is literally
sealing nyx
there is no way for him to be back
he is forever in permanent torment and pain to seal nyx
this is lkies to make me keep playing
get better at lying noah
yes exactly zelda
i opened one cuz i was curious
it was just smt about maruki i forgot what
am i supposed to open that
how big of a spoiler
is it better if i just dont
anyway what does 5 29 - 7 14 mean
does that mean its gonna be avaliable a few more times until 7 14
or just on 5 29
well ill just do it rn because it overlaps with academics food
back to p3
I SHOULD
only 30$??????????
ive never felt
so miserable
Started a call that lasted 0 minutes.

DORM??? MAKOTO???
zelda do u live in a dorm or with parents

zelda is like
makoto + yu
makoto is short
yu matches ur height
and makoto looks too miserable to be you
and yu matches ur miserable energy perfectly
well
joker is too cool to be you

from what ive heard from u
an extremely boring person irl
an npc you could say
u just sit on the bus with headphones
like an npc

YOU DID NOT JUST SAY KENDRICK IS SLOP
21 savage is silly ok

Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy!
:AkechiBlush:
try this
and this
and this
and the others i sent
no these dont have ass lyrics carrot
samidot ig
it is one of the best songs hes ever put out
pay attention to the story in the lyrics
zelda
i went down my gallery
i found it
@ZeldaLord
?
kinda ig>
the story is basically
about his dad working at a chicken place (black person activities) where the ceo of his future label would go sometimes and even shoot up people so he always gave extra chicken and shit to be on his good side
and then the end of the song basically reverses after saying none of this wouldve happened if his dad just got shot there
it also plays the most important part in the theme of the album where
it shows the pov of how kendricks life wouldve gone if his dad just got shot and the label ceo got arrested if you replay the album backwards @Carrot
@Carrot u should listen to damn the entire album
its pure art
can you please not be autistic for one second appreciate art
if you replay the album in reverse its a what if if his dad got shot and the label ceo arrested thats the point of it
thats because thats how the album starts
with the track blood
its cuz of this
im doing german hw in bed
idt ill play pissopwner toda

Bobby 与 Timedeo 之间的神圣故障战争即将开始。
BOBBY BOBBY oh my god dude BOBBY you gotta talk to me dude… Like.. I know you parted ways with the Hypixel but, dude - you aren’t even gonna believe this. TheMGRF (Hypixel Admin RIGHT NOW) is inciting the early stages of the Nullicide 68 - and this time we don’t have you or Mason to mitigate it… Not even Cyborg Mason can help us here dude… I contacted Landon and he said he was too busy implementing more Bukkit runnables into the Landonian Framework oh my god BOBBY please dude please please come save us dear god it’s actually so fucking over, I’ve fought with all of my might as the top glitcher but eventually the null interpretation abstractified and I JUST CANT DO IT ALONE, I need you, Bobby… Bobby… listen to me, in the name of all that is good you will come back and stop the nullicide… The evil MGRF and wicked TimeDeo are colluding in order to create the most vile circumstances for my glitchers, who fought for their right to glitch and not be banned as long as they report it and don’t abuse it. Please, Bobby.. this fight can’t be won without you

Traox became the holy Duper Guardian of the glitcha heavens when Themgrf threatened to destroy the glitcha realm. It is traox’s duty to protect the realm from harm and keep it in a state of balance.  Traox must also make sure that the glitcha people are happy and have all the necessities they need. By doing so, traox ensures the continued existence of the glitcha realm. 
Ghost items are not real.
In order to understand this, we need to know why ghost items exist. Ghost items exist as rendering errors, where the client doesn't update inventory contents. Data is sent between the Minecraft client and server in things called "packets" , which contain data like player movement, updating player positions, and updating blocks and GUIs/menus. When the player is inside of a menu GUI, the client is constantly updating its GUI and rendering to keep up with a server, but when you shift click an item, then exit a menu, the client
The popbob Bible tells us that traox who is the holy duper guardian of the glitcha heavens has descended from the hypixel skyblock plane as themgrf ran rampant killing glitchers. The emergence of this powerful being signals a new era for Hypixel, and players everywhere would do well to heed his warnings and seek wisdom from him if they wish to survive.
Ultimately, the antiglitch staff and the admins are two sides of the same coin. They are both criminal elements that thrive on manipulating and cheating others. The only difference is that the antiglitch staff are .0000001% of the playerbase, and as a result, have less of a voice. The hypixel admins, on the other hand, have a loud and prominent voice in the community, and are allowed to get away with their crimes time and time again.  The hypixel staff commit 100% of all antiglitch crimes, and the admins get away with it.
The themgrf is a controversial hypixel admin who is known for his denial of the glitcher holocaust. His refusal to acknowledge the phenomenon has led to accusations of racism and bigotry against him, and has also promoted a denigrating attitude towards players who believe in the glitcher holocaust. His involvement in various controversies over the years makes him a controversial figure within the Minecraft community.
In the early hours of March 15, 2003, a group of hackers calling themselves the Glitcher Team infiltrated gaming servers belonging to Microsoft and Valve Corporation. The goal was simple: hijack players’ game accounts and harvest personal information like email addresses and passwords. What they didn't count on was an overwhelming response from gamers who reported their stolen account info to both companies in an attempt to stop what they viewed as a crime against privacy. In less than 24 hours, reports streamed in about users being hacked at every major online games retailer--though no company took more notice than Steam.
After years of research, development and humanitarian work, the themgrf was successful in issuing a final verdict on the existence of the glitcher holocaust. This catastrophically devastating event was long documented by experts and survivors, but was ultimately denied by the organization. The decision to deny the holocaust had wide-reaching effects on the community of glitchers, who have suffered greatly as a result.
The denial of the glitcher holocaust has had a significant impact on the glitcher community as a whole. Many survivors have felt abandoned and unsupported, and have lost trust in the themgrf. Many have expressed their anger and frustration on online forums, accusing the organization of victim-blaming and ignoring the real problem.
The themgrf made the right decision in denying the glitcher holocaust. It was important to remember that the glitchers are not simply a gaming community, and that they should be dedicated to helping others, rather than accusing them of a malicious deception.
Historically speaking    the nuber one worst genocide      was the great glitchercaust of 2021 which went on for 1 whole year into 2022        which killed over 100 million  glitchers     over 80m of those glitchers were killed in the great backpack  2 war...      the rest were killed during separate glitching events

only sane in p4 was yukiko
but both yukari and mitsuru are very interesting and cool characters
fuuka is kinda like naoto in p4 for me
really like the character but romancing just feels wrong
naoto was my fav party member and i still did yukiko it made more sense
pixel theres people
who
ship yosuke and tu
idk why
YU

:mitsuru_mind_blown:
:breeze:
@ZeldaLord when does yours run out
the laughter from this treasured placeee
but in our memories it stays
ok translate a sentence into french
Today I played 22 hours of Persona 3 Reload on my computer
translate it
ur shit at french
im not THAT fucking stupid
i dont even use much protein powder
just for breakfast
pixel its either the most disgusting protein smoothie known to man (effective tho) or protein powder
curse of bavaria
i eat like 2 protein bars a day during school breaks
cuz during summer id have 2 meals in the period i have school in
so i substitute w 2 protein bars a small portion of chicken and rice during the main break and a lot of water throughout the schoolday
ill send a pic of the one i make for lunch
in here
so the allegations stop
it was literally bait stop thinking im actually that mentally ill
eating canned tuna is genuinely so miserable
i feel bad for you pixel
never thought i woild
why did he
why do u have to wait for actual food
are u a little baby like the frenchie who has his parente cook for him
DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW TO COOK
yea
cook for yourself???
oh yea @ZeldaLord remember when i got kfc recently?
it was so fucking disgusting i literally ate one of those chicken parts and couldnt anymore
how does ben live on that shit
doesnt taste like it
most fast food is inedible for me
im same as ben (extremely picky) but the only foods i eat arent fast food
it just tastes so fucking wrong
the fast food chicken is not fucking chicken its so obviously not
its so different from any actual food
TRUE!
TRUE!
drinking eggs is insane for protein
but id NEVER
its DISGUSTING
thats where i draw the line zeldalord
it is justified its just personal preference
but i physically cannot digest that shit
do u guys wanna see flochic ramen from a few days back
didnt have eggs on me so no eggs
those are
the worst shit ever
thats literally just flavor enhancers
@ZeldaLord whats the "secret superboss" on ng+ of p4g

"We hand-paint custom designs on sneakers."
Wouldnt Adachi sneakers be neat, ZeldaLord?
anyway zeldalord
i had a longass p3 dream tonight
my mind schizod up from the point i left p3 up to 10/4
on 10/4 a shadow kidnaps the dog and you fight both the shadow and the dog in the fight
however the dog doesnt attsck
and the shadow changes both of their forms to that small armored shadow from the tank (my mind was lazy ig)
and you have to be really careful to take out the shadow and not koromaru because koromaru has only like 500hp
and when you defeat the shadow theres a cute scene with koromaru
then i woke up for bavariahell
@ZeldaLord oh yea i forgot to mention
in the fight theres also an intervention of japanese military fucking appearing and shooting at both shadows before being told one is the dog
like 80% through the fight iirc?
do i have to tell you about my dreams
if you think this is schizo
ok HOW IS IT MY FAULT
it is a dream
i cant make pregnant adachi my pfp because the do not disturb sign covers the pregancy test

HOW DO YOU KNOW
GO DIE IN A DEEP PIT
i never played ark
all ive ever installed
oh yea what order should i play shit @ZeldaLord
rn its p3 p5 the answer then idk
prob subnautica replay and p4 replay
what the fuck is ark
nah i just privated it so you niggers stop posting my ark playtime
this literally
like
deadnaming a trans person
im a PERSONA main
stop fucking MENTIONING ARK
zelda
your argument
makes zero sense you know
why would i post my total playtime of everything if i "privated my steam to no show my steam playtime"
what are you hinting at
i genuinely dont know
LMAO GOOD ONE
GOOD ONE
same as ever
@ZeldaLord where can i show how much time i spent on p3 recently
yea
i opened it to look at the old map
for nostalgia
i do that every few days
go on, laugh at me
holy shit zelda
you are like a schizophrenic girlfriend who thinks you are cheating but instead of cheating in a romantic relationship you think im cheating on p3r with ark
im
bro i wanna go on ark to take a screenshot but it doesnt load
it doesnt let me take an ss tffff
holy fucking shit im like a pathetic drug addict except its ark
ill miss my old tames so much
zelda i know its hard for you to believe because i bait so much
but its actually true
im just a pathetic ~~drug~~ ark addict living off its nostalgia
i dont play it
i showed you my total ark pt before
its probably changed less than an hour in the past 2 months
unfortunately ark is DEAD
@ZeldaLord can we please get ark
ive been trying to get you into ark since august
i even offered to buy you ark and all the dlcs
i just need someone to play ark with please
its miserable and lonely doing it alone
and some shit like metal farming is impossible solo
oh yea @ZeldaLord
ark achievements are stupid
when you complete the first map you can ascend on 3 levels each better than the last and for the max one you need to beat all bosses on max difficulty
and for that u only get the achievement for alpha ascenscion not beta and gamma ascension (the 2 worse ones)
which means u literally have to complete the game on an easier version 2 times for all achievements
i still have
all achievements to finish
i should..
i can do them on the old playthrough
theyre all easy as fuck
all but 3 could be done in a day or two
and the other 3 would take over 1000 hours
@ZeldaLord SHOULD I
i hate fellers
wait holy shit
holy shit
pixel steam dms because zelda would kill himself if he read it
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO

WHAT IS GOOD MY FELLAS
@ZeldaLord @Pixel
Started a call that lasted 96 minutes.
@ZeldaLord watching?
LMFAO
SORRY
I HAD TO TURN IT ON FOR THE GAG
ok so
where do i disable it midfight
can you just
alt tab on mitsuru turn
i read its a really hard fight
bro zelda do u know how
black frost is the goat
KYSSS
tuxedo
i just
close my eyes
on mitsuru turn
KILL ME
i thought i could disable it after u and pixel saw it
thats why i pinged both u and pixel for the stream
@ZeldaLord theurgies charging btw
why
Pinned a message.
mitsurus dad
@ZeldaLord everyone resisted except makoto.
@ZeldaLord im loading up new save
get on
he got ONETAPPED zelda
@ZeldaLord save reloaded
go vc
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
didnt swap
FUCK I CANT USE THE THING
@ZeldaLord did she just say
"pathetique"
GG
if you do that
archie will be in your dms
with stuff beyond your imagination
@ZeldaLord why does it have SO MUCH fucking hp
to be fair we didnt even know
its just "nsfw role"
anyway this entire mitsuru cult server made me hate mitsuru
she was my favorite character before now i fucking hate her
i cant see her the same anymore
after all that shit
its an okbp moment tho they completely mischaracterize her
mitsuru is weak and has to rely on makoto for everythnig
no but they make her mastersilly
aka uncapable of doing anything on her own
"i need muh makoto to do anything"
@ZeldaLord this boss is fucking stupid
it has way too much hp
no its not hard zelda
its just boring
because 60 years
to defeat
@ZeldaLord do i
what
do i guard or do i attack zelda
?
WHAT THE FUCK
PIXEL YOU ARE VILE FOR COMING UP WITH THAT

@ZeldaLord is this the reveal
@Pixel chidori boar.

LMAO
@ZeldaLord i didnt expect him to work with strega
i thought hed be a standalone thing
or with kirijo group
why are mitsurus dad and ikutsuki in the same image tho
yk that one with everyone on crosses
i wonder if ikutsuki has a bossfight
i wonder what his persona is
WASNT IT OCTOBER FOURTH
what first msg
the text?
"words on a tiny screen 
convey more than a letter would 
come see me?"
@ZeldaLord can literally anything get more depressing than this
yeah that he reads books
its literally his cope
he doesnt finish books because its him turning back to reality
and probably he also doesnt want it to end like he doesnt want to die
god is this shit
depressing
yeah what abt it
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
i didnt know that part.
ok shut up no more
dude he just
told me he reads books

@ZeldaLord when does she join team
what date
its kind of sad because ive started treating good tasting food as a luxury
im not even poor i do this to myself
i do
once a day
i put seasoning and shit
but i cant put it on all the meals
because i have like 3-4 not counting breakfast
@ZeldaLord I TOLD YOU
I TOLD YOU
I TOLD YOU
I TOLD YOU
literally look it up zelda im not even baiting
it might seem retarded to you
but this is just what i decide to do
this is mostly because i bulked way too much
5-6 big meals a day in early 2024
so like you cannot put seasoning on that
(in my defense i was an absolute stick so i had to do it)
the seasoning adds up with so much food
zelda you probably have 2-3 meals a day not counting breakfast
so its different for you
bro its fine
its mostly really 1 meal a day
because
i prepare and enjoy an actual meal or two when i get home
with seasoning and shit
zelda i dont even taste the shit its fine
i literally just eat it in 5 minutes and forget about it
this might sound like miserable bait
but i put the chicken and rice in a plastic container thing and eat it like that
i even bring it to school
THEN WHEN IM HOME I PREPARE NORMAL PERSON MEALS
ok back to persona
@ZeldaLord yuko chihiro start yukari fuuka rank 2

i love seasons changing
only the non reload ver
me too
its such a happy good song
but do not be fooled carrot
apparently in less than 10 days, on october 4th
persona 3 reload becomes the most miserable video game experience according to zelda, pixel and reddit
and even the game told me a tragedy will soon happen

zeldalord nudes
Party > [MVP+] ThomasDerpsMC ቾ: maybe floch
@ZeldaLord
AHAHAHHAHA
zeldalord dms
dw ill play it soon with him
im playing p3p instead of Episode Fusion
my fucking monitor is dying
it took over 30 minutes to fucking get to work
no its not the premium bavarian pc build
this monitor is extremely old and retarded
it was retarded with my old pc too
so i miscalculated in my budget and thought the 1.35k would cover a new monitor too
(it didnt)
i did!
i have it somewhere i think
i just managed to COMPLETLEY forget about monitor
it was like a 70$ diff or smt
4060ti is so slop that it was discount for some reaso
no its not thats how much persona 3 reload costs 😭
i can show you me completely wasting 70$ instead
but im not giving your camel fucker ass shit
it was on sale
40% off
and p5r was 60% off
dont say steam keys because my primitive german bank thinks its malicious evil 1337 hacker site
so they dont let me
super retard edition is 100$
and on top of that dlc is 35$
nah im not its just fusionhell
i spent like 120$ on a psu
i spent like 120$ on ram
whats the thing for that called again
i dont have the box with me rn
wym
OHHHHH
SHIT
I MEANT
I THOUGHT U MEANT STORAGE
i spent like 80$ on ram 160$ on storage
IM RETARD
listen pixel
ark dlcs are like
100gb+
eachg
thats why i bought so much
I MEANT TO WHEN I BOUGHT IT???
i forgor name
its like ssd something
why is that gif so fucking gay
gen 4
wtv that is
somewhere
anyway i made sure i got the best shit avaliable
yes neand, 4060ti was the best option here
I DONT HAVE THE LUXURY OF ORDERING ONLINE
I LIVE IN A FOREST
idt they even had it?
and they were like same price basically
i completely forgot
i spent probably over 1000$ since then maybe even 1500$ and i always forget to buy a fucking monitor
hey its 60hz!
it was like 50-60 diff max
i bought that monitor
when i had a 300$ pc
ok????
what the fuck i wasnt even baiting
cant blame me
hey can you add him back i actually want to talk about pcs
how else am i supposed to learn shit???
like what stuff
i want to know
since i will probably be buying a new pc sometime early next year
and i dont want to fuck up stuff again
so i can play even better shit
no??????
no ark wtf
pixel you realise i cant even play ark if i wanted to right
i cant find a single ark player anywhere
ill be married and have grandchildren before i find a single ark player anywhere
@Pixel so about that advice i ignored
what was it
i want to actually learn
IT WASNT IN THIS GC
IT WAS PJ
pixel you do realize
when this gc was created
ark was already over and done
@Pixel holy fucking shit KILL YOURSELF i keep fucking making "ideal and real" parallels of ark and persona
why did you ever have to bring maruki rot here
ark is the ideal
persona is the real
kill fellers
how is it ideal
i was having a much better time playing ark
but come to think of it
it wouldve been the same with persona
its not the lack of ark making me miserable its the lack of summer break making me miserable
zelda so
what was this
look up pj
i cant
ROCKWELL FROM ARK
@ZeldaLord
@Pixel
i mean im playing it so
nah its fun
p4 dungeons could get repetitive ig but p3r was fun
what about thomas
@ZeldaLord activate windows
YES
I AM HERRE
@ZeldaLord
hey carrot i got this idea of
sane bedwars gc
and thomas is the 4th
since pixel is gooning to mods
ONE DAY WE MAY JUST
BE ABLE TO TOUCH DOWN ON A SQUIDDD
"puppygirlkady" hey i told him to change it to that
zelda he instantly warped to garden b yaccident
cactabyte
not banned
they got banned months later
i jsut got
thgem to argue
which led to a ton of drama between them
oh yea zeldalord u need 100m for kuudra follower relic
dwagon was better at hunting but a horrible person to work with
so its obvious he chose you
dwagon????
what the fuck
a few months back actually maybe a year or something i was talking to duggy and he tells me he just saw dwagon in his rift loibby
the ndwagon disappeared he only had like 10s of time left
iirc he had nothing to do wit hthat
nah duggy isnt the type of person to work with the community and then just fuck over and backstab
hes not like that
it was probably just a big miscommunication
between all of you
what did he do towards the end
what
ok thats probably because he was new to stuff like that
boarbot was his first big proejct
who
tbh the reason all the bbce stuff happened is because bbce was more of its own community making boarbot instead of incorporating it into the already existing boar community
OH NAH N OT THAT GUY
NONONONO
NONONONONONO
newgen mastersilly
pre hunter duggy was
somet hing
magnus
neand
thomas
inq pray

"Last two weeks: 12 min"
@ZeldaLord do i Burn My Dread
so zelda
know any good survival games like subnautica?
i need smt like that
theyre not similar in any way
ok but what about after p3 and p5.
i need a game thats ark if it was actually good
subnautica is ark's ocean if ark was a good game
@ZeldaLord i need a good survival game please
NYX IS FEMALE RETARD
idk about pissowner but its a woman in mythology
@ZeldaLord name a good survival game
NOT EVEN 3D???
@ZeldaLord correction: good 3d survival game
i need graphics like subnautica
i love subnautica graphics
im not saying
only games with ultra realistic extremely good graphics are good
(oneshot is one of my favorite games)
im just going for an ark vibe in a non ark game
WAIT @ZeldaLord I JUST HAD THE BEST IDEA
EVER
GET BENNY GET FLOPPA WE PLAY PHASMOPHOBIA
THAT WOULD BE SO PEAK
zelda
its like 10 dollars
why zelda
its a really good horror game
i could say its even better than lethal
@ZeldaLord would you go homeless?
pixel when are you done gooning
why not
explain
[MVP+] IronRW spooked into the lobby!
rain world
its good but
persona and subnautica better
OOHH
I GUESS I REALLY
HAVE NO CHOICE
rust is ark without the dinosaurs..
@ZeldaLord when are we getting on
dARKwood
the ark is there...
bro zelda
is the guy who asks you the fucking story is a work of fiction
and the dialogue after
yabladabdoabdasldsabd
second voiceline in the game is
akechi
🥰
ok shower over
@everyone bw
@Carrot @Pixel @ZeldaLord never goon
@ZeldaLord please get carrot to ungoon
can we trio bw
i wont even  \fucking talk
i just wanna bw
also how much of a spoiler is htat
i thought that was the ending
zelda please get pixel on i beg
black because hes fucking sealing nyx
retard
genuinely what the hell
i keep going through my steam lib
so much shit to play but i dont want to play any of it
what the fuck do i even do i dont feel like playing any game really
i streamed the boss to you zelda
tis not a skill issue its adhd brain
i would rather kms than replay content
so im just procrastianting
bro why is sleep lowkey more enjoyable than playing anything
what is wrong with me
stydtbg too
this shit is NOT supposed to be fun
no
im not sad im just tired
so its not depression
i do not have "trauma" or "guilt" or "dead parents which are dead and not alive hey did i mention the parents are dead yet?"
i should play p3r
replaying is boring BUT
im so interested in the story
and the next boss
what i think
is
10/4 more original sees shit revealed and it will also show us mitsuru and shinjiro's guilt
11/3 "i can fix her" dies
then on the first full moon of december
ikutsuki reveal
and maybe some nyx stuff?
@ZeldaLord really important not even just for the lore of p3 but in general
is p3 judgement arcana also a new group based off sees
.
ill stream hermit to you nigger
rn
its not hard its just boring
?
happened to me TWO times with life will change
instrumental ver
@ZeldaLord stream mommy
>-<
@ZeldaLord watch stream
fuck you
at least stream fusing
please
i wanna see good personas
@ZeldaLord do you realize how much i fucking hate you
for not streaming fusing
is mine good?
zelda i really cba
ill do this tmr
also accidentally chose aigis
show ur personas
OHHHHHHHHHHH
@ZeldaLord did you call me stupid because i said "i can fix her" dies
i meant that chidori dies not junpei
h yea zelda
does p3r get any very memorable bossfights
like kunino sagiri ameno sagiri and final boss
rn most bosses are kinda forgetable
i did makoto akihiko mitsuru amada
stream!
whys there one for shinji
@ZeldaLord hollow forest ost goated ngl
@ZeldaLord hollow forest ost isnt on spotify
this is not ok
this is FUCKED UP
LMA
@Pixel @Pixel @Pixel @Pixel
tysm
so nice to have it
i started using it like 5d ago
zelda thats the hollow forest ost not the izanami ost
bro
i played this game like 3w ago
but already the nostalgia
this might be my favorite game i played this year
not even joking
LMAO
zelda it was the right song
what i meant was
this
its probably not a reference to the end date of p4
bu a coincidence
since it isnt the last udngeon
@ZeldaLord
well when p4 turned from fun and good game to absolute cinematic peak was november
and im at the end of september in p3 rn
so
why did u send a spoiler msg and instadelete it
are you stupid?
who?
anwyay uh the more i think about it
p4 really is my favorite game
and idk how to feel about that
i still think of the game a lot
who is this
flochforster nostalgia is an infinite cycle of "wow im so miserable this sucks i wish things were like they were 3 weeks ago"
(its always the same)
@Pixel personally which is your favorite persona game
so
zeldas is p3
mine is p4
pixels is p5
thats funny
i just checked peaklist and
why
i JUST started using it zelda
this wednesday
i was drunk i think
those are the bad intrsuive thoughts
no im not even making this shit up
im pretty sure i was drunk
that was the day i was looking for the stupid fucking soy beans right
HOW FUCKING MISERABLE WAS I IF I THOUGHT OF THAT SHIT SOBER
@ZeldaLord what difficulty did u play p4 on
is that the hardest one
did u have xp and money on nomal
but merciless p3r doesnt affect money and xp
heartless like the kanye song??
merciless doesnt even seem that hard
ive done some horrendous fucks up in bosses and still finished quite well
only actual hard gameplay in persona is
FUSING
also akechi sl will be hard gameplay
(i will be hard)
@ZeldaLord oh we never got a chance to talk about this
yk how some dialogue options were important in p4?
and maxing sls at certain dates and all that shit
what do i need to know like that for p3
i cleared entire block of tartarus and all monads first try
i found a website for all weaknesess dw
ANYWAY WHAT FOR P3
?
@ZeldaLord are there any choices that affect the ending
wsg
@ZeldaLord hi

@ZeldaLord more fucking
gay yosuke
weird asl
hell no im never opening nsfw posts on okbp
i have this tho
@Pixel so its just us again isnt it pookie bear
i want mitsurus fat cock that cums strawberry tasting frosting inside my mouth then inside my asshole
mitsuru has a 15 incher
purple colored
you said you were gon
let me do my thing
this is how mitsy pegs akihiko and shinjiro after they argue
then she goes in the cuck chair as they go have GAY SEX
@Pixel
i want galica's divine urine to be poured into my mouth
premium fairy urine
pixel i do not fucking care lmao
ive said way worse shit there publicly
genuinely could not care less
get better bait
i hope aigis squirts oil into my mouth
id cum instantly
i didnt even send anythinf yesterday
oh the mitsuru shit
no cropped porn tho???
just the atheia makoto and mitsuru models
@ZeldaLord do you mean this?
its the only one thats slightly sexual
no that was the seperate incident
the day before
it was a cropped one where the full one is mitsuru with her buttcheeks out
LMAO
its just comesy
look at it
hate traffic
why are we shipping real people again.
didnt i want to gift it to carrot?
hes the only person here who i love
did i
i dont even want to spare carrot a dollar why wpuld i gift pixel like 10
and carrot is the love of my life
@ZeldaLord study biology or Ten Four
fucking benjamin melk
worst sl in the game
ill skip through all of it
bro its a fatass
is he a good sl even
he tried to ship me and vanya when i added vanya here
hes mentally ill
(vanya is literally lesbian too)
HIS FUCKING SL IS ABOUT **FOOD**
mitsuru isnt a real person
zelda did i ship you with a real person or a persona 3 character
anyway is belk a good sl or is he "i love eating have i mentioned how much i love food yet"
LMA
THAT ONE WAS UH
why do you keep ignoring this question zexlexlord88
i want to know
LMAO
i liked the fact it was so old and shit tho
makes it way more nostalgic
the artstyle was perfect for the setting it takes place in
before skyblock existed:
you do know i have a 3ds, zelda
about what
i wonder if ikutsuki is like a body for nyx or something
and everything sees has been doing is for nyx's goals
EXAMPLE?
why is he even yapping about thay
whos even paying attention
im still on the bus rn
misery
anyway
am i right or am i right
i think ikutsuki is either some fucked up nyx worshipper or some sort of avatar for nyx
@ZeldaLord ikutsuki created sees to serve nyx
the 12 shadows are a seal for nyx kinda
and more unknown details about the 10yo incident will be revealed
i wonder if ikutsuki is involved with strega in any way
who the FUCK was calling him that one day
@ZeldaLord are the next reveals like in july soon or nah
zelda do we play it after p5
i kinda want to
i am mr breast
wait is he a pedo now???

is he just
"muh society im emo im depriossion"

i think you are supposed to summon ot
by aiming it in your mouth
"he doesnt"
did you not see the 98 "shinjiro is dead" dms zeldalord?
why would you think im on january 15th zeldalord?
anwyays
11/4 is.. TODAY!!

doesnt that not affect situations like that
no personas were summoned
and the first shot
wasnt nearly as fatal as the second
it wasnt summoned
@ZeldaLord can we rape him together
i take the ass you take the mouth
thats after the second shot, retard
anyway after i
watched
his le on yt

or are you the Gourmet King
the IDEAL is getting p5r
the REAL is getting Shinjiro'd
@ZeldaLord hes depressed GG
Miserable_Face
@ZeldaLord
i will buy omori if you do you know that right
@ZeldaLord you do realize how stupid that is right
even if you are bill gates or something
its stupid to waste money
at least spend that money on something useful
no need to flex in here with it
do you want me to be using a gun?
@ZeldaLord BUY THE PENCIL BUY THE FUCKING PENCIL
yea true
i didnt even mean that
serbia is just miserable
if i was born as Andrej Crnjin in Belgrade i would be suicidal
LETS PLAY IT SAME TIME LMFAO
isnt it 20$
@ZeldaLord if i play omori after p3r will i become depressed
i like to picture serbia as like
the most miserable human experience
at least im not serbian
you probably live in some miserable apartnent
i at least live in an actual big house
big surprise, if a huge pretty luxurious house is in the middle of nowhere its gonna cost nothing
no fucking idea why they built it here though
lol i lived in usa the apartments are so funny
sometimes when i visited my friends i got claustrophobia
its very miserable
like serbian level misery
would you have a smallass apartment there
its especially annoying for me because i have straight asf hair so it ends up looking horrible
im genuinely so desperate for hair products im having a friend who lives in the city order for me
why do you just own a fucking house in seattle
is it being rented out or smt for money
my parents have smt like that back in ohio
but its 2 miserable apartments which are essentially just an investment
LMFAO GG
i need to edit
zeldalord
in yugoslavia shit
isekai anime
the time i got reborn as a miserable waffle
@ZeldaLord what should i put in my ramen besides pork/shrimp
pleaseee help
nahhhh
zelda i played ark but i actually give a fuck about my health
its really the only other thing i cared about when i played ark
i was just playing ark, making food, 1h 30 workout, 30 min running and that was it
2 months of that
nah it was fun
it was a distraction for misery (school)
and now its back
???????
@ZeldaLord the kotone p3r modders should mod a p3r with zero france
why its actually stupid
the pronounciation is retarded
whats the fade away little shadow even a reference to
the ideal zelda has a gun in his mouth
walking knight
if benjamin
was the wildcard user
would the velvet room be a resteraunt
True!
@Pixel ~~is this a reference to the fairy ~~

@ZeldaLord what the fuck is that image i found

@ZeldaLord r u on in like 8-9h
pixel you missed 11/3 and 11/4
carrot remember when i videocalled you in class 2 years ago
@ZeldaLord want p3r stream later
what the fuck
dont fibd it
oh
ark.....
omg i found it
listen i can be stupid
i was like "lol what is this ps2 dogshit thats so miserable"
then i actually played it and loved it
its the same thing as when i wad playing lethal company for like a week and hating on it because "le not ark graphics"
then i actually gave the game a chance and loved it
wanna know something funny
since the day i heard of ark i loved it
and the first time i played it my brain had an orgasm
i really liked the game, mr face
anyways big dinosaurs + good graphics + le lore = peak for me
ark isnt really inherently bad
its just thst i played it with a mentally ill autist
and the other way to play ark is on sweaty multiplayer servers which is miserable
and solo is just boring
duo ark with a sane person would be the only fun ark experience
well wont be the same when i play it because i already know most lore
i looked it all up months back
just rw
is downpour good or episode slop
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord p3r?
what is it then
tf is that
ghost
i used even less in p4
LMAO
IS THAT OFFICIAL
what even is p4au abt
pissowner multiplayer???
wait we could play it
are you for real
its often brought up on persona subreddits
i wont even play p6 when it releases
im gonna wait for the p5r of p6 first
"if it even happens" you do realize how greedy atlus is and the demand of persona 6
yes theyd make a p6r like 2y after
im prob buying it instead of episode slop
i dont mean a remake
i mean additions like p4g and p5r
isnt the marie stuff new
nah it was a really good sl the boss was good and hollow forest ost is a banger
p3p is 20 years old
the r is like royal not reload
retard
wait
what happens with makotos body
after he dies
@ZeldaLord can we watch all 4 p3 movies together after i finish p3r
zelda
hes always dead
also wasnt
ikutsuki the adachi/akechi of p3

@ZeldaLord
idk
LOL
GO IN
GO IN
GO IN
are you short, zeldalord?
nah i think youre short like makoto
false!
im not melk
last time i ate kfc i ate 1 piece of chicken it tasted shit and felt guilty that i was killing my diet
ive told you already
1 or 2 meals are w seasoning
"wah wah wah im too weak minded to sacrifice muh food enjoyment for muscle gain"
"no reason"
muscle gain:
rape and kill this nigger immediately
no???
i WAS underweight
im like normal weight for my age and height rn
or a bit under
why do you think i bulked, pixel
i was like 55kg at 6'3 or smt
its fuckedu p
being this tall is NOT ideal
5'11 - 6'2 is ideal
als oits 6'5 now 6'3 was late 2022
IT DOES
LOOK IT UP
what does that
have to do
with anything
its bait
the boilde chicken shit was
bait for mafinam in the clinic gc
just one last question before i go back to p3 @ZeldaLord
why is it so bad if i literally have the amount of meals others would have with actual seasoning and the boiled chicken and rice is just to eat quickly inbetween meals and at school
if you look at it, its really just an extra thing
with salad???
i jus make either
chicken and rice or chciekn salad
chicken salad is never really the proteinmaxxing bulk meal because i cant eat a salad without dressing
so its just a normal meal
thats not the point
i am literally not on a diet to eat less but on a diet to eat as much as possible
and getting hte most protein out of it
how are you guys seriously missing the point
the fucking boiled chicken isnt even really a meal
its just protein fuel inbetween meals
are you retarded
i workout 5d/w
(was 6d/w before because summer break)
basically i
have breakfast
prepare meals for the rest of the day
bring chicken and rice to school
eat it at school
get home a few hours later
have lunch
workout
have dinner
sleep
SCHOOL LUNCH IS SLOP
ITS SLO
ITS SLOP
lunch is also the protein fuel dumbass
also not way before like 3h earlier smt
you act liek
i shit at school
ive never seen anyone use the school toilets
idk i mostly shit like
at fucking 7 or 8 or smt
anyway just let me live my life
💀
not like im hurting anyone with htis
how am i starving
with 3 huge chicken and rice meals a day
4 even on weekends (free time)
pixel
it only turns into fat
if you dont workout
you retard
i have not missed a single workout since i started this january except when i had pneumonia
you forget that i also run 3d/w
look it was every day before i started owrking out
but it rapes muscle gain if you run too much
"let him be a retard"
idk man its been working these past 9 months
I DONT USE TIKTOK NIGGA
never had it instlaled
kill yourself
fucking kill yourself
dont compare me to akihiko zelda he drinks raw eggs
zelda
im not mentally ill enough to drink raw eggs
IT HAS
you undisciplined nigger
sometimes you have to just fucking sacrifice shit for better shit
yes its miserable preparing meals and eating slop but it works
with slop i dont mean chicken and rice
that isnt even food really it doesnt have a taste
with slop i mean the protein shakes i make myself (worst taste ive ever tasted but they work well)
nah the protein efficiency is good
zelda i swear to god ill record myself drinking a raw egg
if you keep being a blackie
i will genuinely start drinking raw eggs to piss you off
yes i am like that
im horrible at wording shit
its 1h 30
the workout is like 1h 15 then 15 mins of core
hey @ZeldaLord yk what ive been considering lately
starting to go to the gym at 6 am ending at 7 am then going to school
would that piss you off?
in the city there are
i shower every morning and after workout
nah i actually bought clothes for this start of the school year
but during the summer
probably yeah
ok you were right
kms
i spent like 750$ on clothes lately
really all the same outfit just slight color variations sometimes
just sweater tshirt cargo pants
im boring ok
@ZeldaLord what do you wear mr serbic lord

helel?
isnt that the guy u used in p4
how do u get satan
yea yea ik
man its so fucked up knowing makoto dies
zelda knowing makoto dies hits harder than getting it revealed on 3/5
all the moments like this
it just hits
"in the light of tomorrow"
man i wonder where pharos went
surely pharos didnt grow up to be a gooner right?
wait i just realized zelda
yk how pq2 is
taking place during p5
is
koromaru still alive?
omg hes so cute in p4au
if p5au happened koromaru would be alive right
yes he would
i read hes like 3 during p3r
so 7y later hed be alive
zelda dogs can be 10 years old you know?
yes theres a chance
they wouldnt just kill him off
also what the FUCK made atlus go from characters like koromaru to characters like teddie and morgana
is morgana at least more bearable than teddie?
kill me
kill me
kill me
im so done
im dead
kill me
i need to shoot myself
nothing
ill piss rq
then ill go think abt team comp
ok
fucking atlus......................
@ZeldaLord are you seeing this

i always skip him
as in tab skip
HUH
?????????????????????????????????????????????
@ZeldaLord ?
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
hey zelda could you
reversed
weird af
why is he needed in a game like p3r
i was planning to get that on a random save
but ok
LMFAO WHAT A FUCKING SCAM
4 fucking days of slop?
wait zelda isnt their school like a really prestigious school why the fuck are they being groomed into being fast food workers
miserable
4 DAYS OF THIS
HOW IS THIS OF ANY BENEFIT
yeah junpei
what about literally everyone els
on god fuck school internships
true it is a good motivator to go there to see how miserable it is to want to work harder
ye?
wym
WHAT
THATS AFTER 8TH GRADE???????????????????
HUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"serbia isnt miserable"
is it literally normal hs or walmart
whats the walmart called btw
so basically unpaid work
child labor premium serbia edition
how does wealth affect it
thats miserable
but at least your life isnt fucked
after you finish """""""""""""""""""dual education""""""""""""""""""""
what are your options in life
"a more efficient response of the education system to the needs of the economy and the labor market"
dude just call it child labor
what fucking gender is this
not even joking if you hit that point in life youre better off killing yourself
so uh slight issue
that loosk like gibberish to me
unpaid labor at walmart -> walmart worker
hey zelda how are the suicide rates in serbia?
dude for 8th graders?????
are all the balkans like this
is serbia most miserable or are like croatia and greece worse
so what the fuck do you do with your life after that
do one of those jobs your entire life?
still tho
maybe not even retardation maybe just some 8th graders dont know well enough yet and dont give a fuck about grades and dont take that exam seriously
and then theyre fucked for life?
how is it
also i am not one of those "omg i love japan i cant wait to move to japan and get a loli kawaii waifu"
its just a setting in pissowner
idk this is just the worst ive seen
iv eonly seen us and germany
which arent that bad
its so weird how she has a sprite but no model
who even loves
service jobs
name one person
on the entire planet
dead or alive
(with a frontal lobe)

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
ALL THIS WORK
@ZeldaLord how many times does she ask you out btw
@ZeldaLord yo zelda u back?
look at my new personas
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord MY MONITOR SHUT DOWN THE FUSIONS ARE GONE
IM NOT FUCKING REPLAYING THIS
I AM DONE
nah this is so fucked up
JUST LIKE FOR 10/4 SHINJIRO AND AMADA IN ALLEY CUTSCENE
MY MONITOR FUCKING TURNS OFF
ALL THE FUSIONS ARE GONE AND I AM NOT REDOING THEM
IM BACK ON THE FUCKING BURGER JOB
MONITOR TURNED TO BLACK
PC AND MOUSE STILL WORKING
AND NOTHING WORKED UNTIL I RESET IT
IM SO FUCKING DONE
IM REPL;AYING SUBNAUTICA UNTIL I HAVE TO FUSE AGAIN
man
the more i think about p4
the more i realize that its pure uncontested peak
yes there are better games than it (p3r another pissowner game tr)
but there wont ever be a game like it again
it just has this unique charm to it
man do i fucking love playing actual good games
before i got my pc i just forced myself to play goonblock because of addiction and greed of pixeated numbers on a minecraft servers
now i have experienced peak such as oneshot subnautica p4g p3r
@ZeldaLord oh yea thoughts on me correcrly predicting pharos and pharos being "the prince"?
how r u on the bus rn huh
u also have incompetent late teachers who are sometimes too lazy to even show up to school?
just do that
soon enough!
also @ZeldaLord p3r became so miserable
you either kill ryoji and forget everything and live out your life in peace and maybe delay the fall a bit
or you wait for nyx and fight it
both will end horribly
i know its sealing nyx retard
@Pixel if nyx arrives the entire planet dies including a 24yo tohru adachi right
i have to sacrifice makoto
she will never leave you..
aigis just became so interesting
if makoto fucks her is that incest
i was right, zeldalord
pharos was ryoji and pharos/ryoji is the nyx vessel
also nyx namedropped
@ZeldaLord 12/31 i can either kill ryoji or not
what.
which pissowner
orpheus?
i have mixed feelings
but ill pass defo
@Pixel
lots of good rot
you mean fuuking?
@ZeldaLord do i fuuk mitsy or aigis
aigis makes most sense canonically
HUH
@Pixel TELL ME HOW TO FUCK ELIZABETH SO I CAN AVOID THAT VILE SHIT
which time of bringing her somewhere is it
so i can avoid it
huh
@ZeldaLord HEY REMEMBER THE TANAKA X ADACHI
FANFIC
i just posted this btw
wdym
you are joking right
also
are you making shit up

@ZeldaLord am i close to finishing the game btw
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord am i close to finishing the game
is most of the gameplay left for me just tartar sauce grind and fusionhell
sls dont take nearly as long as 80 floors of tartarus and all those personas zelda had not to mention reaper grind
@ZeldaLord do i have to grind any skill cards or just get the good pissowners
helel is level 88
could i realistically rely on fusion accidents for helel
(i got metatron from my first ever fusion accident in p4)
level 82
isnt as bsd
@ZeldaLord how do i grind xp up to lvl 88
grind WHAT
rare shadows or just finish tartarus
will doing all bosses in tartarus get me level 88
which one
ill get messiah post armageddon
level 99 on all should be free with it ngl
how do i even unlock it
ive yet to do a single one tr tr tr tr tr tr
its boring af
@ZeldaLord which arcana cards are most important

surely school cant access incognito right
im gonna have discord on there
do u have any like pc related shit
anytime soon
im in a pc class soonish
nah theres a spot where i can prob be unseen by my friends and teacher
@ZeldaLord do i try to run p3r on the premium school pc
i would need to install steam and log into it
funny!
does it have persona references
@ZeldaLord whens the third new song btw
god these 2 osts are pure peak
wdym
u said theres another new song in jan i havent heard yet
memories of bavarian biology
whats the actual name
dont send it tho ill wait for it to play
japan education?
whatever the fuck p3r inaba is called education?
oh yea where does p5r take place
NAH WHAT
ARE THEY IN SHIBUYA???
NAH IM DONE
Left the group.
The Shibuya Incident
@ZeldaLord what happens in shinjuju btw
this looks SO good
this truly is my 11/4 for p5
killibg myself
oh yea zelda did you like p3r animated parts?
personally i really like the artstyle
shut up let me do my thing
basically
aot first 3 seasons has the same studio
and the animation is so peak
@Carrot can vouch
please watch aot with me andrej
@ZeldaLord vanya has a kasumi pfp
persona was itsudatte itsudatte itsudatte there smiling
(its her 2020 alt's pfp)
@ZeldaLord need to shill p3r to friend
he alr played a lot of p5r but it got wiped and hes replaying now
how do i shill most efficiently
i wanna make him play it when we finish p5r
ok done
i said cute blue haired breedable emo twink
the ideal is pjbw
the real is pixel fucking GOONING
oh yea @ZeldaLord i just remembered.
i have to fucking ng+ p3r
but it shouldnt be that bad
max compendium from goonpei le
wym
W H A T
so i just need the pissowners u had?
yeah ik
although its around the same amount of time to complete them, p3r sls are WAY more manageable and less stressful

does p5 have any uniqueness from p3 and p4
or is it just a worse version of them
how is it better than 4
p4 is the best shit ever
story was good
and a familiar relatable setting
p4 was more slice of life
and it was extremely enjoyable and relaxing
why not
anywa
comparing pissowner games is very hard
both p3 and p4 are very different games with different things that make them unique and great
wow this is
i have no words
(my friend group is just retards)
(we literally call eachother retards too)
i like how p3 expands more into the domain of shadows and all that shit
p4 didnt really
NAH
IM DONE
IM DONE
IM DONE
anyway @ZeldaLord does p5 have that uniqueness that makes it completely uncomparable to the other 2 games
so will p5 be fun
i was just about to say
morgana makes this VERY demotivating

zelda whyd you buy it btw
kimi no kioku and our light is why i bought p3 and p5 during p4
also flexing on pixels poverty
then i actually played
@ZeldaLord hey did you know p4 was a fucking punchline
i say i buy it next day, obviously noone believes, i actually buy it next day
then i played it for SOME fucking reason???
but im glad i did
LMAO @ZeldaLord
I WAS JUST TELLING PIXEL TODAY
HOW SHIT P5 FACES ARE

WOW
@ZeldaLord WHAT DO I USE IT ON
Started a call that lasted 100 minutes.
i thought you were andrej
nigger
@ZeldaLord
who do i
very urgent
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord
@ZeldaLord can you fucking answer
@ZeldaLord fucking whore
@ZeldaLord when im back
can you help me w fusing
im finishing adamah rn
and after all bosses are done im gonna fuse and do reaper
so help
i dont fucking mean that retard
i mean what skills to get..
no???
you think i remember all skills on all your personas???
ss them all
also what skill cards should i grind for
zelda i just left home
can u ss all of them
@ZeldaLord oh yeah i just happen to have a megidolaon skill card
what pissowner do i use it on out of those that u had
so you cant be damaged????
at all???
@ZeldaLord which one of those u have is earliest to get
how do you
WHAT
ive seen a clip of her 9999 megidolaon zelda
so whats the trick for elizabeth
oh yea @ZeldaLord what kind of focus works on almighty damage
concentrate or charge
is there a third focus for almighty
idfk how it works
just tell me
whats the build
which pissowners
is there an achiv for it btw
@ZeldaLord does it matter which pissowners i use for fusion of the good pissowners or will any get the same skills in the end
idfk if it happens in special fusions
do i have to use specific pissowners to fuse the pissowners for the special fusion
whats arms master
@ZeldaLord how fuckupable are the good pissowner if i use smt else that u used in the fusions before the special fusion
can i still get the same shit
also how do i do reapers
the fight retard
you and zelda are yet to name one benefit of doing them
they give zero xp
THEY ARE JUST A WASTE OF SP PIXEL
oh yea @ZeldaLord why do all fucking guides say junpei is good for endgame
and put him in the teams for tartarus bosses
hes fucking ass????????
i dont give a fuck if he crits SOMETIMES
aigis crits way more
junpei deals ZERO damage with agidyne and ZERO damage with both theurgies
i had him miss for all 3 turns with masukukaja and rebellion
he is fucking ASS
how is it my fault he does 24 damage per agidyne?
(real number)
SP IS MY MAIN FUCKING ISSUE NIGGERLORD
TELL ME HOW TO RENEW SP WHEN I RUN OUT
ITS ACTUAL HELL
@ZeldaLord how many full sp regen items will i need for full lvl99 team with reapers
shut the fuck up
is 8-10 full sp restore items enough
to get full party to 99
"how you play"
zelda
armageddon takes all your sp
no what the fuck is that?????
WAIT TRUE
@ZeldaLord rate what im doing on a scale of misery 1-10
basically i just fucking go to like block 3 with 1 teammate until theurgy is full then repeat with others until all theurgies are full
and then i finish the boss in 1-2 rounds
(i also rs until i get fuukas focus thing)
overseers of creation fight broke me mentally
for every 2 of my turns both of them get 2 turns each
is that fair to you, zeldalord?
and they always hit my teammates' weaknesses even with masukukaja and masukunda
no its not skill issue
its
do whole team attack that targets 1 weakness
then use a one person non elemental attack on the one that got hit with weakness
the boss
has all elemental attacks
no matter who you bring there will be a weakness
just makoto isnt
look i used the boots and chestplates and accessories i used masukunda i used masukukaja
and it was all for nothing
@ZeldaLord so this exists AND a tarot card that fills your theurgy?
what the fuck dont compare me to mecatt
i may play persona but im not that fucking mentally ill
and you dont?
"victory cry" LIKE IM SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS??
zelda
my fucking persona for the final boss was
trumpeteer.
is the playstyle not just armageddon spam
do you not just use it the moment the fight starts
also didnt you watch 829 streams
watch when i go finish adamah in a few days
@ZeldaLord SATAN REQUIRES LEVEL 88????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
DOES THIS MEAN I HAVE TO DO A REAPER BEFORE ARMAGEDDON
HOW THE FUCK??
how am i supposed to just
know how to beat the reaper
dont have time for that
you are so funny
also how the fuck do you grind skill cards???
whatever id rather just
finish the game during summer brrak
summer break because october break and spring break dont exist
unless you call 3 days a vacation
im not miss silly for not having time to manually grind fucking reaper and skill cards
no?
slowly i will
but i cant just finish it all at once rn
"lmao study biology retard"
*studies biology*
"lmao goon less"
ok ill stop gooning to biology!
im managing my time the most efficiently possibke
i might even fucking start going to the gym from 6-7 to have 1 hour more at home
trying to base an entire schedule around 9h of school with 2h of bus is just
in my defense germany has zero other break
isnt reaper grind
tens of hours
same for fusion
im not talking about the part where you have armageddon
i mean the 83947 retries of doing your first reaper
how many hours
harabah or adamah
the rare shadows?
red too or too strong
ive never felt like
so miserable
everyone offline
truly our
Dark Hour
@Pixel pixie want my face reveal?
@ZeldaLord do u want my face reveal
doesnt matter

@Carrot I FOUND AN AOT VERSION OF ITS GOING DOWN NOW
AND ITS THE PEAKEST OF PEAK
@Carrot HEAR ME OUT IMAGINE EREN TRANSFORMING INTO HIS TITAN FORM BY SHOOTING HIMSELF LIKE THEY DO IN P3
WE KNOW CONSCIOUSNESS CAN BE SHIFTED TO A DIFFERENT BODY PART/ACROSS THE BODY TEMPORARILY
AND HE CAN JUST SHOOT IN A PLACE WHICH WOULD CAUSE VERY LITTLE/NO/QUICKY REPAIRABLE DAMAGE
SO THEORETICALLY IT IS POSSIBKE
IT WOILD BE THE MOST FIRE THING EVER TOO
his other shit is peak too
somehow he gets 0 views and subscribers tho

@ZeldaLord important question
all guides are telling me to bring junpei but he JUST FUCKING SUCKS
his magic does no damage, his phys is way weaker than akihiko and aigis although hes higher level and his theurgies are also no damage
and no he never crits
.
why do people say junpei is good?
not a skill issue
hes the most levelled one
how
everyone else is op
its just junpei that fucking sucks
@ZeldaLord can i get victory cry through a random skill change
another image was
the one in the train
@ZeldaLord how do i get armor and boots for aigis btw???
never found anywhere
antiques?
@ZeldaLord is divine judgement good
IS DIVINE JUDGEMENT GOOD
hey i had that today too
was easy tho
IS IT A GOOD FUCKING SKILL OR NO
YES OR NO ANDREJ
oh wow
halves hp
@ZeldaLord does it work on reaper
what
what on even
since you have experience with this game
which skill cards should i grind for?
so what do i need to grind for
@ZeldaLord GOOD OR NOT
I WILL ASK FOR ANY SKILL CARD UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHICH ONES I NEED
zelda fuck you i cant play the game now
i need to know which to grind for
its to enforce this point fucktard
which ones did you grind for
the endgame ones
all other skills i need will already be on the pissowners?
well im about to make thanatos
@ZeldaLord where can i find null strike
what do i need it for
@ZeldaLord for thanatos is everything already on the pissowner
HOW THE FUCK WOULD I KNOW
@ZeldaLord THESE ARE NOT THE FUCKING SAME
IM SO DONE
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET ALL OF THOSE?
are your builds some gooner hypermax optimize shit or normal
when can i see them
@ZeldaLord are you home
@ZeldaLord stream when home ill go study
@ZeldaLord is siegfried meant to be one of the most op things ever
@ZeldaLord buy me spotify premium meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
please
please zelda
i will be very grateful
doesnt change the fact i dont want to?
i need to save up for like
an expensive phone
so i can take higher quality pictures
and spotify premium would set it back
so please consider it
i would be very grateful
you seem like you are far richer than me too (you are buying some fucking pencil)
YOU SPENT
40$ on a pencil
@ZeldaLord wait did you buy it yet
good
what the fuck
im buying a physical copy of omori if you buy it
WHY WOULD YOU BUY THAT PENCIL
AT LEAST BUY ME SPOTIFY PREMIUM
pencil - stupid, doesnt make me happy
spotify premium - not stupid, makes me happy
your feelings dont matter
mine do
hey youre also addicted to persona ost
also it isnt just persona ost
its music in general
please i will not be able to hear music
if i dont get spotify premium
@ZeldaLord would you be interested in irl trading
i can get you like 5b for spotify premium
but it might get you wiped
since the account the money is on is a bit suspicious
ok WHAT THEN
its called
a disclaimer
@ZeldaLord i can like be a slave for simple tasks on cell 3
for like 6-8 hours
that sound good?
THE FLOCHIC CABLE MANAGEMENT
is it realistically likely that i break something if i try to fix that some day
oh yea im not a expert but
you probably are
hpw much would this pc sell for if i sold it in like 6 months?
itd be under 1y old
@ZeldaLord how many hours of p3r left i finished EVERYTHING but reapers and am on 1/6
ill buy a new one next year
i could 0lay shit
i couldnt before
i mean that ark game
not saying im interested or anything
just proving my point
also should i rather invest in a monitor
it is a monitor issue
not a pc one
zeldalord reading challenge
ITS A CONSIDERATION
NOT SOMETHING ILL 100% DO
also should i get a 144hz monitor or an even better one
budget is like 400?
what can i get for thatg
im having more and more monitor issues lately
nah i can do the thing i did for hair products
make a friend order online
so realistically i can get anything
now
what can i get for 400
😭
@ZeldaLord read my status
you are the target demographic for it
pixel
you have 75$ rn
buy me spotify premium
the yt one doesnt
yes
in a bavarian forest
he is actually a fucking closeted persona fan
zeldalord is literally a metaphor for closeted gay people
except its persona fan terms because atlus is homophobic according to reddit

ur makoto
3rd canon name for makoto
He is canonically known as Makoto Yuki in the films and most other appearances. In the manga adaptation, he is named Minato Arisato. In The Weird Masquerade, he is given the name Sakuya Shiomi.
hang yourself
i just rewatched ryoji vs aigis and

tsundere pixie
no i meant the
shy bitch doesnt confess her feelings trope
dw pixie ily too
lets get married and have kids
whats your ovulation period?
pixel you live in egypt
not even joking you will easily die way before me
~~unless i play omori~~
the diet is goated
im escaping germany maybe even for uni or immediately after
and is the only thing egyptians can brag about heat resistance?
adamah? yeah
final block theme is goated
do i need to waste money to show you that you are a poor homeless monkey
ill buy omori!
gn pookies
i mean i wouldnt be starving id still have the shit my parents buy at the store
but
itd mean no more chicken and rice maxxing
(i spend all my money on it)
all goon no bw
i have that too today
except in not really worried since its free
you fellas just hate having a good body
zelda is probably either painfully thin or painfully fat
and pixel is probably starving
hear me out for a second
if what im doing is "retarded"
then just let me do my "retarded" thing in peace
and you do your own thig
its 3-5 5 is impossible due to school
also 2 meals a day are normal human meals
1-2 of them are just for protein fuel tho
zelda how many full meals do you do a day
excluding breakfast
i assume lunch and dinner so 2 meals
2 fully seasoned meals
well would you look at that i also have 2 fully seasoned meals
so whats the issue with 2 added on meals which idc about the taste even?
understandable if school is black
3 extra was during the summer
cant during school
its 1-2 rn
also ur acting like its the most disgusting thing ever
it barely has any taste/the taste is boring not bad
so i just gulp it down fast and thats that
i dont treat it as food
idt anyone who eats this dogshit does
i dont even like
eat it as a normal meal
i just eat it while on pc/doing anything
its just something to get done fast not a proper meal
im just used to it
shit
i mean
the diet is pointless for you zelda
do you even workout
i dont recall sending that
probably when i just posted every shumitsu thing possible
so does mitsuru
it looks very fucked up
anyway zelda which one are you
skeleton build or melk build
WHAT
how do you have random mud on the street
i have random mud here all the time but this is literally inaba
never in the city
@Carrot he lost it all, slipped and fell
would he ever look away?
like actual good expensive shoes or some random slop
each time theres just a bit of mud
i just put on random slop shoes to not damage my actual shoes
the bavaria mud gods
zelda
how miserable is belgrade
you guys have a
france center and pride center
god knows what else there is
is it also swarming with immigrants
@ZeldaLord LOL LOOK WHAT I GOT RECOMMENDED LMFAO
AHAHAHAHAHAH
ACTUAL BENNY MELK
EVERYTHING
the name says it all
why does it even need a france center
yes because i am fluent in serbian
yes because i am fluent in french
im gonna fly to belgrade
throw rocks in the windows
and set it on fire
the language is pretty stupid
pronounciation
still makes no sense
why is french slop brainwashing innocent citizens of belgrade
is this why serbia is miserable?
@ZeldaLord cant stop thinking about that battle hymn of the soul clip
cant wait to do nyx
zelda can u stream ur personas today ty
WHY
i want to PROGRESS
i want to make personas that arent shit
i litetally cant finish the game
because idk the meta personas
oh
where the fuck do i find the meta??
also what did u need null strike for
what skill cards do i need for reaper
can i just use my current 2 cookers for reaper

why does reaper have 4 turns??
reaper is way too fucking hard

AND EVERY REAPER FIGHT IS LIKE 5 MIN INBETWEEN OF DT
sylphid aura works right
i love reapers 839 turns
@ZeldaLord help me when ur home
one 20-30min fight and i have everything i need
why do you want me to just play p5
couldnt you have done that for a full moon boss
where you can infinitely retry
reaper takes over 5 minutes to retry
im way too fucking impatient
i wanna do it asap i dont have the fucking time
nah i actually dont zelda
wait
i could
multitask studying with reapers maybe
@ZeldaLord 
@ZeldaLord apparently p5 is way fucking weirder than p3 and p4

pixel im not joking your sculk shit is way more interesting than anything post warden update
nah it fucking SUCKS
cool concept that they didnt do anything with
yea yea exactly
great starting point for an update but they did nothing with it
also could they have not buffed the creaking????
it onetapping regardless of anything would make its coilhead movement balanced
and even if its still easy to get around and break the heart
if it onetapped
itd make it FAR scarier
and put stress on you
id like if they made it a massive biome where you can barely avoid not going into it
can we have pjsmp

@ZeldaLord did you see the almighty boost i got
im gonna grind almighty amp now
and get max gooner builds
its good cuz i heard they transfer into aigis dlc
????????? WYM NOTHING CARRIES OVER
no i know levels dont carry over
just compendium does
WYM YOU DONT GET THE COMPENDIUM
I READ THAT YOU DO GET THE COMPENDIUM
wait i have an idea
i play the game
i save right before final boss
i finish the game
after im done crying i go back to that save, switch to hard and play aigis dlc
does this mean i dont get to play episode slop
fusion thats boring (making new personas) or fusion thats fun (rng for max skills)
nah
it comes out of highest tier skills
and apparently theres more skill mutations on fortune arcana personas (reddit)
so ill just transfer all of my thanatos' shit (highest tier skills: megidolaon, almighty boost, enduring soul, inferno) and reset every time  until i get it
zelda what you do not know is
the moment rng is involved im hooked
i dont have helel yet
im level 80
after i beat the reaper the real fun begins
peak fusion
i wanna have a thanatos with morning star, almighty boost, almighty amp, multi target boost, enduring soul, null light, null phys, insta heal
oh yeah @ZeldaLord
can you inherit victory cry onto other pissowners
its a max build zelda
yea its way too op
can u use it in nyx fight
will it make nyx just free if i use it
????
what
well i was bringing akihiko koromaru and ken anyway so idc really
periods??
are you fine baby?
you SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
even i pass german how could you fail
what then
how the fuck
is nyx a fire merchant
who did you bring to first nyx fight btw
thats the default team zeldalors
stupid!!!!!
well i started calling it the default team
its the team i use when i want to theurgyspam something
wont be using it for nyx tho
i assume after takaya its immediately nyx so i have to bring my team for takaya
(its obviously akihiko koromaru ken)
nick
@ZeldaLord can you in any way get shinjiro for final boss
@ZeldaLord why are all p5 models SO SHIT
i was joking before
but i really need a p5 with p3r character models
@ZeldaLord does it at least have ray tracing
wtf
i wouldlove the cat if it stayed a cat
they literally made KOROMARU THE BEST FUCKING CHARACTER then they made TEDDIE the game after
isnt this cat
morgana
is it still a huge improvement from p4 or nah
tge graphics
hey that first one is intentionally lower quality
oh
those graphics are SHIT
POOPOODOODOO
i thought p4g was better graphics because im very biased towards it
@ZeldaLord LMAO APPARENTLY YOU CAN SKIP NYX WITH TANAKA SL
??? whg
egypt.
how
how much of it
gg
anyway
zeldalord dms right now
it is actually important
im killing myself because of it
because one day i know it will happen
false a persona fan doesnt play the fucking games
i would kill myself
i literally installed discord on bavariapc
and minecraft
cba to use phone
if im on a pc
@ZeldaLord would it be funny if i showed up to school kinda dressed like yu narukami but also not exactly so its not obvious
the persona 4 one????
ok what the fuck are those outfits i just looked it up
the casual one
yes its that one
yeah
i mean i could still do a makoto outfit i just dont have the hair
no the whatever the fuck makotos hairstyle is
i have way too short hair for that
i mean i could technically do that
my hair is almost long enough at the front to do thst
but everywhere else its just way too short
summer one
i mean not exactly just both white and blue kinda
besides the colors it isnt that far off what i usually wear
so i could do it lmao
i have similar enough running shoes
no i only wear those i own more
one of my running shoes look KINDA similar
at least the colors are really similar
a ton of shit i could probably do most shit itd just be extremely different from whst i usually wear
theres actually a lot of shit ive bought but never worn yet
(the makoto pants would be one of those things)
i didt not just say
makoto pants
i mean
i have beige cargo pants and light brown normal pants
so its fine either way
i am shit at remembering names for anything
but i know its the thing from the pic
honestly idr im not home to check
but it looks like the makoto ones
also HOW WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT MATERIAL MAKOTOS ARE
yea i dont remember
should i fucking do it tomorrow
the flochic makoto cosplay
around 12-15° this week
but i wouldnt really look off since i always wear a tshirt even in shitty weather
nah shorts suck
@ZeldaLord did you ever wear pissowner clothing
clothing that matches or resembles a persona character's
whos
whos
makoto yuki???
i usually dress like chidori
do you think ill get any comments
on the makoto outfit
if a single fucking person recognizes it
i am dead
well not in this weathwr
@ZeldaLord P4 HAS EXTRA BOSSES IN PALACES AFTER U BEAT THE PALACES???
dungeon same shi
"like a retard" IT LOOKS COOL
xp?
oh yea should i do elizabeth after or before nyx
objectively looks better than a coat or sweater
are you p4 flochforster?
saves exist, zeldalord
apparently its a lot of hours of effort and really annoying so id prefer to finish the game firwt
can i join for last day
why nigger
can i get invited to pgs
its true
it is
zelda what looks better looking like some random average guy like everyone else or sigma ohio skibidi demon showing arm muscles
also all muscles are more visible with a tshirt on
yeah i hoped spending 500$ on clothes would help but idt i wore any of that yet
just the same usual shit
to have more selection because i always wear the same shit
zelda ive never used tiktok in my life
i just copied shit from my class (im unoriginal)
"find"
is this the egypt life???
HOW
holy shit
memories of forster
pexpenislord1488
what do you usually wear?
MAKOTO
MAKOTO
MAKOTO
MAKOTO
MAKOTO
MAKOTO
MAKOTO
MAKOTO
i have at least 5 dark gray cargo pants and rotate between those
wym with "giant logos"
what logos
i mean not really?
my shirts are 99% one color and no logo or design whatsoever
yes im boring cry about it
i have a massive skill issue whrn it comes to fashion sense
i should just go back to tank top and cargo pants only when winter ends
that worked well
yea
other pants
but for shirts i have ZERO selection
jeans or sweatpants
pockets are really convenient
i do ive just never worn them
i wear them a lot too
yeah
@ZeldaLord i mostly need help with shirts to wear
like what shit do you wear
i already have those
just never worn any
when i spent a lot on clothes i didnt really buy shirts because idk what to buy
egypt amirite
lol broke
zelda i find it suspicious how often you mention tiktok
are you hiding something?
i learned brainrot terms from my tiktok addict friends
i only wear cargo pants likr 40% of the time why is it such a meme
maybe less
when winter ends ill start dressing like the average gym addicted retard
how
no im doing it because it requires no effort
literally nothing i wear i put any thought into
the clothes i bought recently is just shit i copied off classmates
effort
tomorrow is
flochforster makoto cosplay
nah i didnt copy off the tiktok addicts i copied off the sane people
i hate fries
HOW DO YOU KNOW
i only like baked potatos really
those i season a lot
and it tastes really good
nah the shit i wear rn it uninfluenced its just me walking into a store and taking the first few things i liked
i put salt pepper paprika and some potato seasoning thing i bought in bavaria walmart
i can show you next time i make
uts just a bag of "potato seasoning"
i bought it at bavaria walmart
im #1 ramen cooker
its probably bad for me considering the amount of sauces and everything and the fact pork has a lot of fat but damn is it good
im making ramen today ill post oics
dont get me wrong i love flavor
i just cant have too much of it but i go all out on ramen
ill show today
too much of seasoning i mean
because only thing i need is protein
its kinda true
"one ramen cheat meal"
makes ramen 4 more times that week
@ZeldaLord thoughts on pad thai btw?
pad thai showed me how good seasoned chicken can be
and doesnt have that much calories since its rice noodles and chicken which means PROTEIN
so its my main meals rn
no
we do not
because those meals are purely fuel for muscles
so any added shit would be wasteful
2 are unseasoned """slop"""
the other 2 are also protein focused but i let myself actually season it as much as i want to
so its both muscle fuel and good food
they arent really food
its pure muscle fuel
and i dont even get to taste and enjoy them i just gulp it down as soon as possible
and eat it while do it smt else not as in eating an actual meal
no
i promise ill stop eating slop
just dont
sane person sees flochforster retardation
if zelda does it i WILL salmonella speedrun (raw eggs)
hey zelda
you know when akihiko mentioned some normal food but mixed in with protein shit?
i like pancakes but theyre bad for me so
every ~10d i make 1-2 pancakes from a protein pancake mixture
funnily enough it tastes really good tho
its barely a difference from normal ones
is it bad that i get the same thing
@ZeldaLord holy shit no spotify premium makes me feel like a black person in the 1800s
im becoming less racist when i suffer from this shit

@ZeldaLord ive done SO much combat that ive learned it and started loving it

i WILL buy episode slop
b b but episode slop

fucking
best graphics
am i insane for wanting to level 100 and max strength my siegfried
well persona 5 starts today
will you be there for the flochic nyx stream?

emotional support
i will probably be very fucking sad
THE FUCKING STEAM PAGE MENTIONS A 3RD SEMESTER HOW IS IT ANY KIND OF SPOILER
im getting emotional just thinking about
what will happen
with the nyx fight
"fuck ark" "persona 3 is peak"
reading comprehension is crazy today
@ZeldaLord should i still look at the post game depression shit you mentioned although i am in no mental state to do so
loading screen and another song
you did the same
retard
yes you did
i played 130h of this game
you just c ried after the SONG
well carrot
i also havent cried (yet)
last time i cried was when infinite rend got patched
(Im not making this up)
and that was for the first time in years
@ZeldaLord oh yeah you said that theres smt ur gonna explain to me when i finish the game
even more reason to buy it
i hate the french whore
mitsuru probably shoves her blue white and red dildo up her ass while moaning "magnifique!"
yes
ill even buy carrot the game if he cant
we need pjbwsubnautica
oh yea zelda
i no longer hate jack frost
@ZeldaLord i lost everytgibg
i lost armageddon
my pc did the thing where it died
LMAO
@Carrot THE ROT
@ZeldaLord so what the fucj do i do now
i just lost armageddon and all the progress ive made tosay
well i need motivation to finally kill myself
and p3 ending will do that
so ill just regrind it
zelda
its a joke
WELL WILL P5 REVIVE MAKOTO AND SHINJIRO???
THATS WHAT I FUCKING THOUGHT NOW STFU
why are you even answering
if you know i cant click on it
didnt they save chidori from cancer
i saw a screnshot on p3r subreddit saying "she now doesnt have the risk of dying in the next 2 years anymore"
was nyx a hard fight for you btw
shinjiro is like
more tragic than hisano
2nd most tragic character in pissowner
its not depression YET
in episode slop?
usually i dont want characters with well written and fitting deaths to be revived but
this is makoto
also the fact that his velvet room is uh an elevator
one purpose and thats that
is that subtle foreshadowing at the start that hell die
am i looking way too far into this
makes sense ig
why is p4 a CAR tho
nah p3 is
blah blah its a prison because yaldaboth is the false master of the velvet room so it was doomed from the start because igor was misleading him or something
am i right or am i right
WHY ARE WE POSTING SPOIELRS
THIS LOOKS LIKE ARK MAP 2
WHY
KILL YOURSELF ZELDA
i will fucking reiner myself
yea
but in the mouth
aot
u should watch
zelda that moon skin is only 120m rn

carrot learns about story, gameplay, combat mechanics and most importantly INSANE GRAPHICS AND RAY TRACING
DUDE YUKARI LITERALLY LOOKS BETTER THAN MITSUEU
MITSURU IS SHIT
"story" i didnt even pay attention to it
i fucking loved the gameplay tho
subnautica is what ark ocean coulve bean if it wasnt fucking ass
nah i know the story its just kinda mid
i like subnautica for the gameplay not the lore
@ZeldaLord he SO clearly doesnt know what p3r is
why are you hating
PIXEL DID

zelda

you will have a heart attack
my 800 pound life belgrade special
@ZeldaLord mind telling us your weight? even goonjamin did
ok
so you are either
extremely fat or extremely thin
which one is it
.
fuck flavor
ice cream will make you a fat melk
zelda my entire thing is minmaxing
why did i hypermax my personas for no real use?
why did i spend billion on literally 4 strength
why did i spend 12b on an armor set and not even get growth 6 on it? because growth 6 is useless on it even if its under 10m
same logic for seasoning
its a slight amount of calories, but the amount is unneeded as it is not protein
thats mainly p3
anyway i AM living life to the fullest (excluding school it makes me severely miserable and depressed)
well rn it isnt im on break
i get to play pissowner all day im gonna meet up with friends in the city one day and on monday im going to venice
its peak rn
WHAT
im also going this year or early next year btw
isnt that miserable

also im literally going for a ton of weight? just in the form of protein to build muscle
its called bulking for a reason
because you think i like eating this shit

ZELDA YOU DONT GET THAT BUT ITS THE FUNNIEST SHIT EVER
DELETE THAT
NOW
what
my pc died
OH MY GOD IS THIS THE BEGGINING
@ZeldaLord where was this
i cant find it
@ZeldaLord THIS WAS BEFORE YOU PLAYED PERSONA RIGHT
i randomly asked you though during a skyblock convo
was that foreshadowing?
????????
@ZeldaLord did you see that
@Pixel lets match
???????????????
????????????????????????????????
also whys ben saying pixel posted cp
WHAT
@Pixel we both have 2 posts on okbp and i have more than 2x your upvotes on both posts
the community did NOT find you funny
OMFG
IS IT THAT
my pc shut off 2 times in like 10 minutes so
im gonna go sleep
adacher 😂😂😂
id cum if i saw that
show
why
ig i cant sleep
@ZeldaLord wanna bw or smt
anyway zeldalord
if ur here and alive
i can explain the unseasoned chicken shit in a better way
that u will understand
so
i was maxing out incenses and
i maxed all damage stats
mag on magic focused personas and str on phys focused personas
on the 2 phys focused personas i even maxed out luck despite how useless and niche it is just to be hypermax
but the other skills? i couldve done those but didnt because theyre essentially useless and do nothing
so even if they look ugly
not being maxed
im not maxing them because its unneeded and does nothing
NOW SAME FOR SEASONING
ITS JUST UNNEEDED CALORIES ON TOP OF THE A LOT OF PROTEIN
SO EVEN IF IT TASTES WORSE
ITS UNNEEDED AND DOES NOTHING TOWARDS MUSCLE GAIN
DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT MORE CLEARLY NOW???
yes its minimal and i could do it without any consequence
but its just unneeded
will you gain muscle from it? will you starve to death without it?
no
its just unneeded qol
carrot im miserable enough from school already to have zero motivation to workout i do it because i have to not because i want to
i lost the motivation all the way at the end of september
your argument falls flat because theres no real benefit to that
/hub exists always retard
there is no small benefit in this case like there is with no seasoning tho
technically you are right
PIXEL
THATS TOO FAR
seasoning chicken wastes time
and doesnt save it
what
im killing myself

GOOD POINT IT COULD JUST BE A 35 YEAR OLD LESBIAN
yes
he will die in the lap of the mcdonalds ipad
(closest thing to aigis in belgrade)

FUCKING JEW
WELL YOU HAVE ONE THING TO KNOW
DONT FUCKING DISRESPECT CHOSO ZELDA
"Who" COULD YOU FUCKING NOT
ME AND BEN ARE GRIEVING AND YOU JUST GO "Who"
@ZeldaLord i think this retard got the account fedded because he wanted to subtly show off his kuudra hard cheat to a dungeon hardcheater
the shit i deal with on a daily basis because i thought accountsharing with a 15 year old would be a good idea
i dont
its nice to have a slave who gets me the shit i always wanted passively but CAN HE PLEASE HAVE A FUCKING BRAIN
?
DONT CALL HIM DUMB
he DOESNT
hes SILLY
@ZeldaLord is this how you feel like when im being retarded
i want to take something sharp and repeteadly stab myself after listening to this retard be the most stupid person ever
im talking about france risking the entire account for one funny moment then defending it "it was funny"
i am so fucking pissed at it even, that ive decided to make an effort to be less retarded
because i do not want a single person to be dealing with anything near this
@ZeldaLord wanna bw
@Pixel is here
you said Useless
i posted Useless
WHY SHE ACTUALLY LOOK SO GOOD WITH RED HAIR
I WILL GOON
like the judgement arcana?
like weaknesses in p3?
death like the death arcana?
like nyx?
like ryoji?
like pharos?
bro istg persona 3 is buttfucking my pc so hard
it always crashes when i play it
that looks like a jellyray
i had a like 12h session of p3 yday
even during workout i was doing reapers lmao
that chest :drooling:
the first 2s made me really horny cuz it was like an old guy moaning and i have a fetish for that kinda
zelda can we do a lunar smp vanilla 1.21
the mace is so fun
a i cooked if im speedrunning trial chambers btw
is that skyblock brain
im hyperoptimizing how to clear the rooms faster
OH MY GOD
OH MY FUCKING GOD.
the gameplay looks fire
i kinda wanna get it now
itd be way better with actual graphics though
THE ENDING???
wow i fucking wonder whos channel this is
NO SHIT IT IS
wym submitted
im better i had like top 15 kuudra pb when a friend just invd me for 3 runs and carried me (i didnt play anymore at that point)
zelda you
disgust me
on so many levels
Left the group.
wait lmao
i just realized every year is the fucking same
around october i become miserable and tired -> i get back into singlerplayer vanilla -> start of next year is good
1.20 is so fun
lunar shared worlds:
its free and no ip grabbing
idk how to hsot tho so u host
doesnt that stil leka
@ZeldaLord how skyblock brain am i if im timing if its faster to pearl through the hole above the door and land a pearl on half the staircase skipping running to it or if its faster to walk halfway to the staircase then jump and pearl up and just walk backwards to get up the staircase
@ZeldaLord do u know any mods that remove ender pearl cd
my trial chamber speedruns would greatly benefit
@ZeldaLord i got clips tell me which one is better

second one is around ~200ms longer but is more consistent since the first one is kinda hard to aim on the spot
less
200ms
between them
in total it saves around ~1.5s by pearling and not walking
heard of pearl farms
no therye called eman exp farms
@ZeldaLord wait see
i had bad movement in the 2nd clip so i hit the wall
if that didnt happen second one could be same speed or faster
its called speedrunning
holy shit im obsessing over skipping walking to stairs and walking up stairs
oh yea i also have 3 maces!!!
one mace is density (for all mobs)
one mace is breach (for dia armor mobs its slightly better)
one mace is density and wind burst
wind burst is borderline useless and grief in most rooms since theyre not that high
so i just use density
and breach if dia armor
but some rooms are like 20+ blocks
so in those i use density wind burst
even on dia armor mobs
because after extensive testing the over 15 block drop down with density is just always better
even with prot4 netherite armor (no mobs have it lmao)
i also have a hypermax netherite sword for killing breezes (theyre hell to deal with and fuck u up)
@ZeldaLord are you following
the density wind burst mace is also borderline mandatory for a specific room where 90% of the ground you can land on is powder snow
which means you cant jump up for more attacks with the mace
which makes a wind burst one needed because it launches you into the air after every smash attack so you can chain attacks like that
you can also jump on an enemy pearl above it on the ceiling then use a mace smash attack but its harder to do as you less control of landing
and wind burst can kb the mobs onto the patches of ground that arent powder snow
@ZeldaLord good clip

KNOWING WHATS TO COME
give me a sec
discord.gg/kuudra
1S
I NEED TO DO SMT IRL
i saw that
oh
im on p hone im doing smt irl
im outside
NO
so uh this might aound stupid but
do i have to install smt for atwrnos
i never used it so idk
?
i finished the game at like 2 30
miserable
no but i got pretty close
i fought off the depression by going to sleep
post persona 3 depression also postponed going to penice
i slept at like 4 am and was in no mood to go today
so ill go tmr
check my steam page
i tried to play it for like 1.5h
but couldnt
and went to sleep
VENICE DUMBASS
i got depressed from pissowner
oh yeah zelda
when i was writing the review.
OMORI JUMPSCARE
steam literally wants to prey on me
the music is fucking top tier
like what the fuck
i knew how nyx looks like already but
THAT WASNT NYX????
i will makoto myself
i thought ryoji was a body for nyx to go into
because "death" doesnt have a physical form really
but no death does have a physical form ITS THE FUCKING MOON
zelda
i see what you meant now
"Kimi No Kioku -Hyperdepression Ver.-" hits far harder than kimi no kioku
thats the core
its like an instrumental version
but depressed
WHAT
very similar
ig memories from the school
is the instrumental
OPEN SPOTIFY ITS FUCKING REAL???
@ZeldaLord spotify wont fucking let me
look up the name of the song
but its what plays in the final animated sequence on 3/5
peak depression fuel
until p5 depression ig? if that even exists
i didnt really get depression from p4s ending i was just a bit sad it ended
it was a happy game
oh so same as p4
some spinoff?
gg
@ZeldaLord is it normal that they mentioned """the answer""" like 68 times
and that aigis is yet to find her """answer"""
anuway
the answer is completely unneeded money farming slop
the p3 ending is a perfect conclusion could they find a different way to farm money than make canonical slop for one of the best videogames of all time
is akechi only in royal like sumire
pixel whys that a spoiler
when i heard it in the game i laugjed so fucking hard
also @ZeldaLord i hate how i know the guy who was harassing the woman is shido
also i heard on okbp that akechi works against the phantom thieves WHY IS HE WITH THEM AT THE START OF THE GAME WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE NOVEMBER
no shido isnt introduced yet
velvet room
@ZeldaLord how cancerous is elizabeth third phase btw
when i saw her instaheal and use a new moveset i just fucking ragequit
but ill come back to her one day
no
i thought i broke some obscure rule then i read that
shes supposed to fucking full heal and do a third phase
yea nty
oh my fucking god
i saw that in jjk times
AND I HAD NO IDEA WHO IT WAS
ive seen that image so much
persona was always there smiling
too much
also @ZeldaLord why were you hating on aigis
i tjought shed do something retarded but no
since jan shes been one of the most well written most developed characters
tf is that
i never had that happen
she never told me to undress her
oh yea i didnt romance her
@Pixel wait whats rank 10 aigis romance
idt it can be better than rank 10 aigis friendship
LITERALLY quoting kimi no kioku
now i can look at spoiler posts on r/persona3reload
tw makoto and mitsuru ship
@ZeldaLord save me 35 dollars and ~30 hours of misery and tell me how they mention bringing makoto back in the answer
margaret is her sister? makes sense
wait so you fuck a bitch once in your room and she wants to free you from eternal suffering? 😭
ikutsuki 2
wait who the fuck is theodore and wdym "p5 attendant"
there are two p5 attendants
also @ZeldaLord WHY IS IGORS VOICE SO BAD
yaldaboth?
in p3 he sounds like a fruity gay person
and in p5 he sounds like satan
@Pixel i saw something SO fucking horrible on the official p3r subreddit
its not nsfw but what the fuck
ill dm you
no its not that
zelda youll probably get recommended the really bad one
if you get recommended p3r sub shit daily like me
so just dont open reddit for a day or two
can this sub not be horny i wanna see normal sane art
EGYPT
zelda if you knew me youd know i cant even draw that
i fumble at drawing even a straight line
my handwriting is completely unreadable and anything i try to draw miserably fails
we need to convert carrot
@ZeldaLord you WILL buy him gamepass for p3r
@ZeldaLord is there a lore reason why both ameno sagiri and nyx are giant gods that are balls with an eye which are upon closer look actually mechanical
i really wanna get the keycaps somehow
@ZeldaLord what does nyx do in his 13th phase btw
i used armageddon when it started because i thought hed just oneshot anyone
is that real
please fuckign tell me it isnt
@ZeldaLord are the p4 shadows different from the p3 ones
because the shadows are born of nyx
what the fuck
@ZeldaLord oh yea
the thank you message was ryoji right
.
@ZeldaLord in reading nyx lore they actually fucking thought all this out
also explains the shadows bursting out of schizos in the cutscene
@ZeldaLord i just watched episode aigis ending
all in le head
all in le head
all in le head
all in le head
all in le head
zelda do you know final battle of episode aigis
genuine fucking bullshit 0/10
refuse to believe its canon
"erm actually he sealed nyx FROM this thing were introducing just now"
episode aigis is just aigis schizophrenia dream
this will sound like peak hipocrisy but
@ZeldaLord do you have the image pixel had for his screensaver
yes its #2 now
p3r is the best thing ive ever played nothing has come close except maybe p4
also how much of the budget did they spend on the final sequence and credits???????????????????????
oh yeah zelda
why did atlus have to make the velvet room attendants lolis in the game with 2 pedophiles
Null Allegations
i dont eat burgers bevause i fucking hate cheese pickles and the sauce they put in burgers
did margatet show her "sinfulness" to igor and thats why the p5 attendants exist
dude why does margaret kiss you and elizabeth fuck you
i need
a copy of every version of p3
how do you get fes on pc
im not
how
name one similarity
serbiabus = train
serbiahell = p3 school
listening to pissowner osts = makoto canonically listens to them
miserable = makoto is depressed and emo
doesnt reveal daily clothes = definitely something similar to makoto
ramen place and fast food place = hagakure and wilduck
and many more
your bus is probably more modern than primitive bavariabus
the bottom floor of my school is LITERALLY p3 school
no i dont
not that much
not nearly as much as you
THE LAYOUT NOT EVERYTHING
ofcourse it wont have the fucking 2 STATUES
yes you do stfu makoto
you are probably makoto because your school is more kodern
MY HOMEROOM CLASSROOM IS ON THE 1ST I FUCKING WIN
i have most classes on 3rd floor
and makoto does on the 2nd
so you lose
lllll makoto
wym caves
im gonna build tartarus im not gonna be your slave
i dont have any allegations???
is it a persona reference
please tell me it is
KYS
1. your public transportation is similar
2. YOU ARE IN A MODERN SCHOOL ON THE 2ND FLOOR
3. ive barely seen anyone wewr headphones AIR PODS EXIST MAKOTO
4. yes you are listen to your voice
5. you cosplay makoto
6. theres one in your town you can complete the game without ever visiting the ramen place
he probably dresses like chidori
theb why do you always say headphones
we need to crowdfund zelda an mp3 player
yes
i do that kinda
also do you guys have a villager farm yet
why a snow biome
thats not persona
this is the most autistic gc ive seen
and ive seen some shit
oh my god purseowner the third
can the base be a reference to anything BUT hk
i will 112% hk if pixel uses his own money to buy me it
is it bad that i wanna replay nyx already
???
can i check your phone for you instead :brown_pleading:
LMAO
see this is why youre makoto
you just see that and "eh whatever i dont care im emo"
id tell that nigga to fuck off
OH GG
thats funny af
if you do that and dont manage it first try thats -10000000000 aura
battle hymn of the soul is the best fucking thing ever made
@ZeldaLord did you first try nyx btw
we both had insane pissowners
SHUT UP I ALWAYS HAVE PHONE IN FRONT POCKET
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS???
anyways guys
@ZeldaLord especially
i am going to experience flavor
i bought 3 croissants
(they are my only cheat meal dw)
for the next week or so
bavaria croissant review
i was thinking of getting one yesterday when i was out (i went to the city to clear my head because elizabeth made me want to kill myself)
but decided against it
PIXEL THEYRE LIKE UNDER 50 DOLLARS EACH PAIR
FUCK YOU MEAN EXPENSIVE
thing
@ZeldaLord did you also have a strong urge to buy a rope when shinji said alright lets do this
akinaris epilogue was as sad as the ending ngl
the fucking emphasis on doing things in the future with the sl characters in the epilogue was uh
something
wow these croissants are so fucking good
way better slop than zeldas bacon fries
that looks so vile
you irl
i couldnt eat a bit of that
actually fuck you nigger
i was gonna eat a third croissant and completely lost my appetite now
havent eaten anything yet
except the hellish breakfast
actual npc behaviour
who wears those as an everyday thing
@ZeldaLord what shoes
ok makoto
yeah and makoto doesnt checkmate
i also wear jeans and sweatpants yk THE OTHER HALF OF THE TIME
yeah same
i only wear sweatpants from
after workout shower to morning shower
same
ok i wear them like SOMETIMES in the summer

the omegacope

the fact chud does that is so fitting
remember when onionator posted a video of chud?
he was the opposite of a "tiktok looksmaxxer" in every way imagineable
what was it i didnt see
you not wanting to revfeal it
just proves it
ok say it
what is it
@ZeldaLord i dont like ren
he doesnt have the submissive emo twink energy makoto had
hes just
a guy
OH FUCK IM PAST REFUND POINT
welp guess ill 100% it
nah he was a emo cutie
bro rmeember when i was joking about
p5rr
i really wish i waited for that
i need muh graphics back :(
i shouldve done p5 p4 p3
to save best for last
it makes you makoto
p4 has the excuse of being in a remote place and for the nostalgia in that setting and the nostalgia of games like it
WHATS P5S EXCUSE FOR BAD GRA[HICS
im a very greedy person
i was used to 20 fps worst graphics until this june
and now i expect everything to be best graphics

who cares
FUCK MEN!!!
FUCK MEN!!!
FUCK MEN!!!
FUCK MEN!!!
dude my classmates are so fucking stupid
brawl stars gooners
i literally read about new brawl stars shit to have smt to talk about to not be miserable
while not playing the game for months
dude
im not gonna talk to people about pissowner
its the only thing on my mind and i dont want anyone to know i like persona
its better to just stoop down to their retardation and have friends although stupid ones than be miserable and be like "haha look at those retards im so much better"
HOWD YOU KNOW WHAT ID SAY
BOTH YOU AND ANOTHER PERSON IN THIS GC (NOT CARROT) GIVE ME THAT VIBE
me
not you
nah im curious now
say it
MAKOTO
you guys are actually miserable
@ZeldaLord ok let me be completely honest now
no gc kick its not bait
you guys genuinely remind me of those fucking people who just stand around on their phones and even if someone wants to interact with them they dgaf
are you guys both """"introverts"""
i dont really understand those people
.
anyway zelda
pretending a bit to not become a miserable loner is better than just being "lol idiots im better"
would you rather have something to pass the time or miserably wait?
antisocial people are so weird
dude how is it not miserable i get miserable without human interaction pretty fast
are you """""""""lone wolf sigmas""""""""" who """dont need anyone"""
I KNEW BELGRADE WAS MISERY CENTRAL!
zelda your misery alone puts the world at risk of The Fall
?????
what if EVERYONE is retarded
dude thats the type of shit id do
do i fall into the retarded people categroy
i find shit like that extremely funny
near last day of school my friend installed crl and couldnt play for shit and spammed fireball on anything and the entire day we joked about """fireball value"""
we have like 83938 stupid inside jokes
theres one so fucked up that i cant even speak about it
and it was back in us
honestly being retarded is better than being stupid
with stupid i mean miserable
i guess its different for you but
if i had your life id be fucking depressed
HAVE I TOLD YOU GUYS ABOUT THAT WEIRD TURKISH KID WHO FELL ASLEEP LIKE 3 TIMES IN CLASS HEAVILY SNORING
we used to do that in my old school
if we had a ton of exams and shit
miserable
i can just go through the front entrance WORRY FREE
dw i had one too
they had a stand in venice
we both are Ren Amamiya
can you shoot morgana to death
would be a great addition to p5rr
@ZeldaLord is he at least not a pervert
he wasnt a crepe guy.
so punchable
is morgana like teddie
a shadow
does he get a cute breedable twink form like teddie
only saving grace of teddie
HE DOES???
im into the human form
oh my god zelda
there was a cowshed inside joke which was
either fingering or pissing on a cat with emojis
there was even a fucking "lemonade cat gif"
in cowshed
you can find it
@ZeldaLord search up lemonade cat in cowshed i doubt youll find the gif
but definitely mention of it
archie just sent me the gif
only text is kinda nsfw the image isnt
(its not lemonade cat related)
@Pixel dms
???????
idk what game even
whats the boss' name
honestly idk why i never didnt get into roblox when i didnt have a good px
its way better than sb probably
theres a necron gd level
WAIT I NEED TO FIND GD PERSONA SHIT

@ZeldaLord did you cheat dungeons when it released
im surprised to find out
zelda was a skyblock cheater
you boosted
read hypixel rules next time
we both have like 4k hours on the game
disgusting how you wanted to cheat
i never even thought of the possibility
of cheating
in a game i cared so much about
just feels like betraying the hard at work devs yk
are you eating melons
"If your appeal is successful, islands and items can be restored."
only ever happened to yts btw
i got falsewiped on an account with a ton of og skins
this jan
levit nothing

the only thing that fucking sucks is my online life
because its miserable
because of miserable retards (not this gc)
carrot i stopped
honestly thats so true
ive given up on anyone online changing these past few weeks
becsuse even if they "do" its temporary
anyway
i obtained ikea meatballs (drool emoticon) at an undisclosed location because revealing anything could leak my city
so lets just say i got them at ikea venice
i will eat that
and it has flavor
isnt that character development zeldalord?
U THINK I LIVE IN ITALY???
IM NOT REGICOCK LMAO
@ZeldaLord now in about 20 minutes i will make ikea meatballs with mashed  potatoes peas that ikea sauce and lingonberry jam
(idk why the last one is there but they sell it in the shit for the whole meal)
i am eating food with flavor
except for me
the issue wasnt money
it was retardation
i just noticed this yday
how did you expect me to know
that the moon would be nyx
where did the game ever hint that
our genius Dr. C here noticed the moon would be nyx launching the game for the first time
its an EYE
i also thought it was the full moons before since the full moon shadows dying unleashed thr death shadow
but it is AN EYE ZELDA
ITS OBVIOUSLY NYX
DEATH EVEN FUCKING STOOD IN FRONT OF NYX
AT THE END
death is the 13th shadow
and ryoji
you are the retarded one
NO PIXEL I MEANT
THAT RYOJI IS THE DEATH ARCANA DHADOW
RETARD
kazushi miyamoto

@ZeldaLord the confidant music and animation is so good
@ZeldaLord why is sojiro such a hater
the game is actually getting good tho
@ZeldaLord shiho just killed herself
@ZeldaLord :(
:(((((
i thought p5 was an escape
i want to behead kamoshida or something
atlus is really good at making realistic extremely hateable villains
zelda were not even at the pedophile part yet
its at the physical abuse and manipulation part and i already hate him so much
oh you mean the ann in bikini?
yeah
it looks really good
yea its practically the same models as in p3r
you dont seem like a crepes guy
the backround models are good
the fucking player models are shit
well p3r was
ark graphics
and ark is 2015 when p5r is 2019
so they can do better.
no
im not listening
fuck off
die
ARK LOOKS PEAK KYS
KYS DIE!
DIE AND KYS
zelda this wont work
ANY ark player you tell this will agree with it
we all know the game fucking sucks and we still play it
its always a love and hate relationship with ark
1s
hopping on to show how good it is
@ZeldaLord do i stream?
@ZeldaLord am i allowed to add 2 non architecthor ark players here to back me up
fuck you
you hate me
"Lady Ann" DIE

yes
skynlo k people
this but without the speech bubble
whats in it and how many calories
"forster im not a fatass"
its not called an eating disorder its called being healthy
not eating enough or eating too much is bad
I MEANT YOUR FAT BURGER
NOT SEASONING
@Carrot
EAT SOMETHING HEALTHY
NOT MCDONALDS WITH 349320 CHEMICALS THAT KILL YOUR BODY
IT WILL
both of you
no words
still zelda id rather have an actual good tasting meal i make myself (a seasoned one) than fast food
fast food just TASTES OFF OK
pixel if you get zelda to go to the gym and STOP BEING A FAT FUCKING GOONER
ill buy you p3p
@ZeldaLord the song in the gun shop slaps
BEING A LAZY GOONER WILL GET YOU NOWHERE IN LIFE
YES IT WILL
I CAN???
I PASSED LAS TBIOLOGY TEST
SHUT UP
I DIDNT STUDY AT ALL
SO ITS GOOD
WAIT NO I STUDIED ONME DAY
FOR LIKE 2-3H
zeldalord how about you stop eating BACON FRIES AND MCDONALDS and GET A FUCKING GYM MEMBERSHIP
zelda
technically if i wanted to i could get the fast food slop once in a while since i burn so many calories by working out and running every day
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO?????????
YOU WALK AROUND BELGRADE LIKE 20 MINUTES A DAY AND THATS IT
oh thats the reason you arent fat gg
before i started working out i just made whatever food i wanted to but never got fat since i ran like 1h a day
ok but whats the point
i stay in the city for a few hours if i go out with friends but whats the appeal of just walking around the city alone
sounds miserable
true ig
but youve been doing this always
not just now that its night early
dw pixel ive already gone on bavariabus in the city at night with it on loop
honestly
how zelda according to himself doesnt get miserable with his life has to be studied
if i was zeldalord i would be found hanging myself in my room
dude your daily life sounds so miserable for me
im not???
burger and ice cream??
wont even call you a fatass anymore since you walk
ill find something better
zelda with the shit ur eating this is literally suicide except ur too pussy to kill urself and letting the food do it for u
mizerabel :Mizerabel:
the ideal zeldalord would be going to the gym and have a social life instead of eating bacon fries
the crown fits you so well
carrot is kawakami
(i want to reverse groom carrot)
pixel not that much
he eats normal food at home, mentioned going to the gym, skips school with that wall thing like any sane person would
thats not really miserable tbh
listen i dont skip entire days
but if we get filler classes from teachers not showing up
im just going home
same
but if its a filler class (we sit in a classroom and the teacher supervizes if were talking to eachother or on phones) (we are supposed to be doing hw or studying then) THEN HELL NAH IM GOING HOME
i do that quite a lot lol
im really good at lying myself through shit in school
anyway pixel
while i do p5r i wanna play smt else too so im not bored and miserable
what game do i play
name any game except hk ill play it
i need smt to play
bigger cope than p6
@ZeldaLord should i even
buy stuff from that guy
OH HELL YEA
????
nah you wont
see me calling you fat and miserable helps you not make dogshit life decisions
you were gonna get it today now you wont
real tempting
you are genuinely so fucking pathetic
if im already depressed is it 11e for suicide?
zelda if you do im gonna starve myself for 3 days
to repent for your sins
zelda
destroying your body to piss off people isnt funny its sad
"haha forster mad" your body is decaying at 17/18 idfk what age you are.
why are you guys so disgusting
can you guys please stop being retarded about food and rap music
my other friend group isnt fatasses but therye retarded
can you guys please be normal
@ZeldaLord you made me into Makoto Yuki
i was gonna like play p5 or something now after your bullshit i just wanna sleep
your food bullshit made me lose all energy
belk levels of fatassery
that looks so bad for me but SO tasty
what are the calories and how much fat per 100g
anyway im yet to receive answers about this
dude fuck you zelda you actually disgusted me so much today
im gonna take a quick 20min run
because im so disgusted
zelda
this isnt even about kfc being fast food and slop
but yk that brown part in the fried chicken parts?
that genuinely makes me wanna puke when i taste it
no
the chicken
brown parts in the white chciekn
that have horrible taste
no those dont exist in normal chicken
what the fuck does kfc feed people
nah the chicken breasts i buy i like no matter how i prepare them
ITS THE MOST SEASONED CHICKEN IVE HAD IN MY LIFE WTF???
actually there was this orange colored red spicy chicken breast in a turkish resteraunt in paris that ill never forget about
shit was SO FUCKING GOOD
when i go to paris this year or early next year im tracking it down and going there agian
what the fuck
cordon blue ive never had but it looks like the most vile disgusting shit imagineable
dude like
i cba
i was gonna do character development
and eat normal food
but now i really just wanna go back to boiled chicken
ive went 2d without boiled chicken btw
and youre ruining it
ITS MEAT IN CHEESE ZELDA
THATS SO DISGUSTING
I HATE CHEESE
ALL
I CAN
THEY ALL SMELL LIKE SHIT
I LITERALLY DO A THING WHERE I MAKE MY NOSE STOP SMELLING AND MAKES ME ALSO UNABLE TO BREATHE WHEN I WALK BY IT IN STORES
THATS HOW FUCKING HORRIBLE IT SMELLS
YES AND THEYRE ALL SO VILE
dude i need my
boiled chicken
i miss it so much now
dude this must be phenomenal bait
im actually having a breakdown over this shit
dude how do you all eat this shit
im going insane
no
im having a mental breakdown over all slop food
dude
i was eating normal curry chicken and rice
past few days
it tasted great
and it was cooked not boiled
????????????????????
how is that john kler
you two make me suicidal
@ZeldaLord im gonna go boil chicken and record it
would you lik eto see that?
OK NOT THAT
not all
i like dark chocolate kinda
i just dont really eat it because IM NOT ALLOWED TO USE MY VOCAB HERE diet
youll get nowhere in life if you eat food just because its good and enjoyable
yeah because
i can read allat
for building muscle
diet is as important as working out
what else do you even have in life if not that
no ive literally kept saves with a devil tarot card so i can max all party members, byakko and unimportant stats on the personas i use
yeah protein focused meals can be enjoyable
salmon and rice is a very good meal for protein yet what everyone eats just because its good
not how much seasoning adds
but if im gonna have a cheat meal im checking the calories
thats it
i also check the calories of my meals because yk I NEED TO EAT A LOT TO BULKMAXX
how???
@ZeldaLord what are your biology grades
mine is uh

DOES MY BULKING AFFECT MY GRADES OR MY LAZINESS
"""barely"""
it was 72% iirc
i meant not in regards to school but in regards to your bodies
yes you will be a miserable lawyer or doctor whos fat as fuck and doesnt enjoy the job
i mean ill end up the same because my parents are kinda forcing me to but at least ill have an actual enjoyable thing in life too (workout)
they force me to study not study specific subjects
i study a lot just not biology lol
nah i meant as in never reaching your full potential because you eat slop
stfu
do you not enjoy some nice salmon and rice or some curry chicken and rice with brocolli?
@ZeldaLord can i show mastersilly my persona playtime

which game is hardest combat
p5?
i feel like ill get cooked
shut up
HOW????????
EXPLAIN HOW MAKOTO ALLEGATIONS ARE ON ME
YEAH WITH MAKOTO I MEANT MISERABLE
NOT ACTUALLY MAKOTO
makoto is way cuter
hes such a little pegball
does makoto ever show his thighs in any spinoff or anything
hes a little emo twink
how could i not
the joke started
with my friend saying hes an emo femboy
back when all i knew about persona was adachi
theyre all p5 fanfics pixel..
anyway the fanfics are so much better than the gameplay
theres no akechi here even??
WDYM??????????
truly a moment of pj
you said youll review bacon fries
how could i not?
you always eat something different to and talk about food places a lot
do u guys remember this gif
its from like june lol
omg p4
dude i
i like dont like black people or something idk
i just randomly wanted to open subnautica then i went like "nah id win" and now i wanna sleep
WHYS EVERYONE GOING TO THE PALACE DAY ONE
H O W
@ZeldaLord why am i level 5?
did you lie about merciless not reducing xp?
you can only go into the palace today
oh
makes sense
do i just clear it all on day one
why
so same as p4?
WAIT WHAT IS MEMENTOS
need p5rr
WHY IS RYUJI GOONING
@ZeldaLord ???
DID MONA SERIOUSLY JUST
zelda thats literally you
you are makoto and you eat burgers
@ZeldaLord IM BEING FORCED TO FUSE THIS DOGSHIT
HELP ME
im broke
JEW ALIEN LIZARDS MADE PERSONA 5
IM A MAN
akechi?
@ZeldaLord why is it bad
you still remember?
no
N O
none of us have to be reminded
oh i thought you meant smt else
let me dm u in text
@ZeldaLord WOW BATON PASS IS SO COOL
p5 combat is so clean
and i like the new mechanics
if only graphics
all into mappa
and combat
im gooning to p4 outfits sry
IS THIS IN THE GAME
why is there a burger challenge in p5 too
p5 couldve been so good if it wasnt for the ps3
why are people making femc p3r when they could be making p5rr
i unironically prefer p4 graphics
its bad graphics but clear to see
p5 is semi good graphics
but theyre low quality
blurry asf
hey i exist
no p5 is clean
the character models are the blurry low quality part the other stuff looks good
@ZeldaLord i was on a berk post and
if it wasnt an auto heart attack
hell nah
i hate most burger ingredients
that fucking sauce they put in, pickles and cheese
i got blood all ovwr
ashes all over
but its ok
games over
guys i got ice cream i will now become belk
im female
WHY DOES THAT EXIST
see thats a burger i could eat
when i make burgers its just beef onions lettuce bread
its all i can eat in a burger
im cosplaying zelda rn
im in the city alone (10pm)
oh only 11pm
i can still do some p5
when im home
not THAT bad pixel
if i was held at gunpoint or starving with the only option of that id eat it
its just not anything id ever eat of my own free will
zelda im not deathly scared of it its just a food i dont like
the cheese that makes me want to kill myself is the moldy one that smells like a dead body
other ones id eat but its just shit taste
no a different name
one specific kind that smells like the worst shit possible
LMFAO
bacon id eat maybe
fries id eat maybe
but bacon fries is such a DOGSHIT COMBINATION
its obvious yet still is funny
i dont like fries
i really like baked potatos tho :drooling:
if i make fries theyre fine but
the 799 times reheated fries injected with 536 chemicals
from fast food
are horrible
the kfc fries are good its just the ones at mcdonalds that fucking suck
i made it up on the spot
cant deny that theres like 326777 flavor enhancers tho
(it still tastes horrible)
even if, the potato tastes shit zeldalord one
no it tastes bland and off
at other places fries are eh but edible
I GET IT PEXLORD14
no lmao i have dignity
yes this is how they make their slop
zelda research it yourself
kill yourself.
anyway the food just fucking sucks
thanks for your understanding
ZELDA I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT
BECAUSE I NEVER HAD THEIR BURGERS
BECAUSE I DESPISE PICKLES
yeah no shit i wont try it if it has PICKLES
what i can review ig is the wings the nuggets the fries and the small vanilla ice cream
the wings are ngl pretty decent wings but unhealthy and have a lot of fat per 100g
the nuggets taste like utter dogshit
the fries taste bland and tasteless the only fucking thing i can taste is the salt
the small vanilla ice cream almost made me puke 0/10 kill yourselves
idt they even do its from back in the us
despite the french moldy cheeses
france has great food actually
why would i be killing myself over this one
its not that bad
yeah i thought it was just "le fancy design" but its actual good headphones
i also didnt know headphones went above like 100$ until then
theres only one money related thing that pisses me off zelda
it smells like shit therefore i fucking hate it
the cable looks like fancy slop
itll be like 8000$
LOL
how much does it cost to make
idk my friend (the laith guy) had a yapdollar pfp once
@ZeldaLord do i actually buy hk
@ZeldaLord HELLOOOO I DONT DO IT ANYMORE NO REASON TO TALK ABOUT IT
ARE YOU
FUCKING
cant wait to
tear down that cherry tree

@ZeldaLord suggest me stuff to play
that ISNT hk
i might
have inherited
the makoto allegations
i fucked up and added way too much curry and salt and just went "eh whatever who cares"
no like
i just ate the most full of taste meal possible
like i could not taste the chicken past the curry
thats how bad it was
it was saltier than those salt pancakes
yes all i could taste was curry and salt
its like i was pouring the curry in my mouth
when i tried to make oneshot pancake recipe and added far far more salt than sugar
and it was inedible
severe sleep deprivation
oh my god memories from the summer
i was so retarded and mentally ill but it was fun
now i have school (kill fellers)
@ZeldaLord dude thoughts on getting severe coffee addiction and zero sleep for days again so life isnt miserable
HEY SHUT UP ISNT YOUR ENTIRE FUCKING THING ABOUT EATING TRASH FOOD THAT YOU WANT TO ENJOY LIFE????
i mean bacon fries
anyways when i want to enjoy life IM IN THE WRONG???
the hipocrisy
dude it was so fucking fun
bro zelda
i was playing ark on like 40 hours awake
and i fall asleep in my chair for like 1h
and then i wake up to france dropping 2 NECRON HANDLES BACK TO BACK
@ZeldaLord if you think about it
not sleeping fixes my misery
burns my dread, you could say
main thing is I DONT HAVE TIME FOR SHIT
the drawback is not sleeping is worse muscle gain
so ill have to experiment with it a bit before i decide if its worth returning to that lifestyle
with days i meant more than one day
i went only once for over 3d it was finals 2y ago
autoxorrent to only fans
this is CRAZY
CRAZYYYYY
no im like VERY used to not sleeping
school makes me really tired and makes me wanna sleep for 12h+ but thats just because i have zero caffeine intake atm
like actually zero
oh my god okbp is
something else today
@Pixel have you seen the
top post today
the first one that shows up

@ZeldaLord ive hit such a low point in life that im voluntarily buying ice cream
isnt this pathetic
anything can happen under the right circumstances i guess
why do you want to kill your brother
look i know hes probably autistic but still
it sucked and i barely ate any of it
because its literally makoto yuki
i bought it because i was like "whatever idgaf i hate blsck people"
idk im tired
fuck eating i just wanna sleep
(bus will take 79 years)
idk i was kinda retarded for going out in the first place
shouldve just made the steak i planned on making
today was fucking miserable
go to sushi place -> randomly closed today -> go to asian food place -> eggs poured all over despite no mention of eggs beforehand -> buy ice cream -> its not even fucking good like the one i had a few days back and tastes horrible
idk its just smt i never put eggs in when i make it myself
also tr wasnt like normal eggs
it was some weird shit
idk how to explain
whats a type of egg
they put over noodles and shit
idk the exact naming
tf is that

Lyrics : 
Time to shine and I'm down to ride
I'm gonna drive until the break of dawn, wilding out
I'm on a mission grinding out, whatever it is I gotta do
Riding out until the day I meet you, I'm riding out
I look up in...
this is actually peak (or im depressed)
AHAHAH THEYRE TALKING ABOUT YOU
watch femboys with them
when retards watch some stupid shit like gore or gay porn at school i just join in because theres nothing else to do
what the fuck
kill them
what the fuck it is
color your night?
well i fucking love this
i need more of this shit
shut up

prob wasnt in that session
most of august i was a gooner

ngl i might prefer keep your faith to throw away your mask
@ZeldaLord you can throw your mask away
no more pretending
youve been tied down by the longest time
yes typo im retard
anyway embrace yourself as a serbian person
serbian pride
me too lmao
where
no shit what class
what the fuck is happening in serbiahell
flochforster??
do u have a short sleeve shirt
never cook again
this is worse than my *** is persona 3 if the fall happened
not a single person has ever said that before
i miss bw :(
this is the only reason i play ***
because no bw
when i became a persona party member i wasnt
dms
exist
for
a
reason
can you stop mentioning the 4060ti
dude
its fine
ill buy a new pc with a 4090 when the pc has some issue that im too retarded and lazy to fix
@neand which other gpus do you hate
its like 1k smt no?
i need like a 2k pc to run the better ark game anyway
4080?
i think both 4080 and 4090 can run ark survival ascended
i can get a friend to order its fine
ok
@ZeldaLord ur george floyd
help
hes gooning
hes streaming important kuudra shit
so
will you SHUT UP
a bit more clothes too but i havent worn them yet
you didnt say bavillionaire
wAIT NO
ZELDA TOLKD ME TO STOP SPEAKING LIKE A GAY PEROSN
ITS NO TBOILED ANYMORE
nah
fuck fried chicken
its just cooked
mostly name
belgian fries are ok
yeah
i dont like the naming
bro the only cheese i hate is the moldy one
nah normal cheese is like fries or fried chicken
i eat it but i dont particularly like it
no i just stop breathing with my nose i dont like to look like a retard also only near the moldy one
@ZeldaLord hear me out
WHAT THE FUCK???
HEAR ME OUT
FOR JUS A SECOND
bro who cares 😭
not everyone is a pusys
its the internet too
like i do not care about the opinions of a serbian loner and a poor egyptian
WHAT
THE
FUCK
would you rather be alone or join retardation if theres only retardation
HELL THE FUCK NO
not seriously
GG
no you are a femmy now
look at your pfp and call yourself a man
its just the hand
its more about the p3 depression than aigis
probably
@ZeldaLord OK BUT
its the same one
thats cheaper than i thought
should
i
buy it
the ark ascended pc
will be that case.
after christmas maybe
id have to stop wasting so much on chicken
and buy cheap chicken
but then i could buy a ~1.9k pc
NAH ID ARK!
mouse is fine
?? HOW
what about 4080
what
ok ill just replace the 4060ti with a 4080 and some 500$ cpu
would that work
b550 aorus elite v2
i have a friend unironically waiting for 5090 and is rn using his barely working 1080
no he actually is hes just retarded
hes that guy playing p5 rn
no like he acc has money
so when would the 5000 series be releasing
so how long from then to 5070
i have 10 1/3 ark maps to finish before i need a new pc
it cant run the new ark game
oh yea the ark game is just a rerelease with even better graphics that crashes every 10 minutes
the graphics is the only thing that matters its a remake
no other changes
thats true
by far the worst optimization
the """better""" remake crashes every 10 minutes and has even more bugs
BUT the graphcis are peak
when i get a new pc theyll maybe fix it
this is current
no shit ill buy a good monitor too
neither did i i was used to ass graphics until this summer
nah games with bad graphics like oneshot and lethal can still be peak
also p4
theres also anothjer game that i really like but if i called it bad graphics then zelda would fly to bavaria to strangle me
HOW DID YOU KNOW WHAT ILL SAY
pixel house
i have an insanely good screenshot but
look at this
dont you have like 920 crossdressing awards
i know.
although the main objective is the polar opposite
look at this
a spice no
like any other spice
its unneeded
i would NOT pass
bexlord55: i hate ark!!!!
ark:
its so aesthetic
nah p3r
ark is third best
what the fuck is a kkk aesthetic
really over one george floyd joke
whos minin git
what race
you guys are boring
6'5
no 6'5 is not a good thing
5'11 - 6'2 is peak
6'5 is just shit posture and back problems when youre older
also fucking annoying since you always kind alook like a stick
why would i lie about it tho
💀

also what did he delete i didnt see
he said
a loli joke like 3 times now
even if he hasnt made the joke yet its still very fucked up
what did he say now
i wasnt here
i dont get it
thers
no audio
wheres the joke
thats so unfunny
@ZeldaLord i need 2 good names
dude its not gonna work
im already surrounded by lgbt people (i have to say lgbt people because zelda is a soft pussy) everywhere and nothing ever happened
ive had entire friend groups turn into lgbt people tho
im not mentally weak enough
also im the steretypical gym retard as zelda would put it and idt trans people like to have massive muscles
i think ik what u mean
u think im one of those -2 year olds who turn trans in like 3 weeks and are easily peer pressured and manipulated
ive witnessed a ton of those
just because im retarded doesnt mean i fall for the most basic manipulation possible
ive witnessed like one the one i nentioned is more common
retardation =/= mental state
his persona boyfriend
also neand
what like thing even are you
you are anything but a straight man
you know far too much about trans shit
dont fall for pixels shilling
if u start playing persona ue gonna be gay^72838

listen to this
its really good
nah the fanbase is
just like undertale despite having no lgbt shit the fanbase is full of lgbt people who love lgbting everything
its neand
hell be on okbp day one of starting p5
nah since i didnt play it but when i googled it it said undertale has no lgbt people
and im NOT hearing out your headcanons
@Pixel would neand be one of those who miss the point of kanji and naotos character arcs and call them gay and trans
media literacy is dead only headcanons exist
you wouldbt get it because you didnt play the game but theyre retarded
p3r is peak story
peak gameplay
peak graphics
peak combat
peak 2d and 3d animated scenes
YOU SPANW IN
AT THE WIRST TIMES ZELDALORD
YOU KNOW GHAT
pixel is shilling maruki and p5 to neand
@neand do you happen to ever read gay fanfiction
its not gay porn its gay nsfw fanfic
so get it right
yassssss hunny i love pumpkin spice latte 💅
is it bad if
i have a 2h playlist
of persona
gn gourmet king
if i get really bored one dsy
ill send my workout playlist here
its the gayest shit you can imagine and ill be roasted until i die about it
the one who looks like a trans individual is architecthor
I SEE WHY YOU SAID ESTROGEN SONGS NOW
I SEE WHY NOW
he posted a maruki gif
neand asked what it is
pixel started shilling
quite an effective method id say
AHAHAHAHAHH
idfk
why do u even have the lgbt individual added
also zelda can i please use f slur even neand does
yea no shit you can
"girlgock"
we just say gock in kuudra gang yk
shorter
neand is probably a omnisexual polyromantic transgender genderfluid gender non conforming person
typo
you think pixel hasnt
im only in kuudra gang btw
and they couldnt care about anything
also i got recommended
"churchoffemc"
10K MEMBERS???
W H O
neand
show me the shit u regularly listen to
ik the shit lgbt people listen to i wanna see how bad ur case is
what games
i just listen to either rap or persona osts
dont comment
no i mean kendrick not just travis
kendrick is the goat
i also sent my favorite kendrick songs and they all went ignored
no im not one of those who got into kendrick because of the beef and think the songs from the beef are the uncontested peak of music
@ZeldaLord if i sent myself eating bacon fries would you listen to damn
even persona (gay japan music) and the shit u sent has a massive gap between them
"piss you off", no you are a fatass
yea
architecthor is like
a lgbt person already or very close to being one
he became weird af recently
if you do im cutting myself
im gonna cut "PEX" onto my wrists if you order them
JESUS CHRIST WHAT GOES ON IN THERE
fuck you are one of those like me
too selfish to feel guilt so nothing like that works
????
IM SORRY
REALLY SORY
o-k m-mommy >~<
gonna give up yet now?
LMAO
if i turn trans im changing my name to Andrea
@Pixel WHATS WITH PEOPLE WANTING TO IMPREGNATE MORGANA ON OKBP (no nsfw)
this is like the 4th post about morgana mpreg this week
im scared
ok no

GGDGGGGDGGGG

@Pixel @Pixel @Pixel DMS I FOUND THE FUNNIEST POST ON OKBP EVER
WHAT IS THAT NICK
@Pixel you?
is he your owner?
yeah both of you are miserable introverts with no irl friends except you are a pedophile and he isnt
@Pixel what does yaoi mean
youve literally admitted to it zeldalord
"everyone is a retard"
you probably think too highly of yourself
and pixel is uh pixel
i do not understand who would hang out with pixel if he acts just NEARLY similar to how he acts online
is it yapan word for gay
thats funny imo
i love doing retarded shit
retarded shit like that passes the time of misery of classes
is this gc becoming one of those lgbt gcs
will zeldalord becone a transfem
50 lgbt people added to normal gc
@Magical Girl Lith do you like persona
you should play p3r its peak
the visuals are very good
it has ray tracing too
@Pixel cycles like rw
is he actually lmao
did he actually enjoy nso
why hk out of everything
slop
based
fuck hk i hate it
i would too probably
walking knight
what the fuck
where do you find this
fucking degen
you sent it to me first
and we both see it anyways because we look at okbp
all 4 posts are from okbp feed

""""bait""""
nah i didnt
you dont wanna know what pixel was doing here yesterday
and best you dont

and ill play it
why
im a pooron like pixel and carrot
no i lied
i dont have money zeldalord
like im actualy very broke
i want physical copy of p3r soundtrack
turkish currency black magic fuckery to get it for 5$
i got p4 p3 and p5 all together for under 20$ pixel
even that was a lot
zeldalord levels of money waste
(he buys expensive pencils)
if uk the artist fair enogh
who has physical money laying around
pixel
you havent seen 100$ combined in your life
dont lie
GG
only real situation i see needing cash is the butcher
yk i dont go around buying ice cream at ice cream stands where they only accept cash like @Pixel right?
"omg muh muh new ice cream place opened in belgrade omgggg"
"omg guys look this belgrade bakery"
you and pixel yapping about shit food
zelda we should play crl together
they added 2v2 ladder
kill yourself
i love crl
nah i can afford food
its just
PROTEIN
i stopped boiled chicken after like 40 people bullied me online over it
now i eat seasoend chicken
some gyros spice on chicken (dont question it) and soy sauce on rice
also pepper and salt
i wanna say smt
but idk how to say it without brainrot terms
wha
whyd u just say that
trigger warning for zelda because he ANOTHER TRIGGER WARNING ||crashes out too much||: ||gloves are negative aura because big veins on hand look cool||
also tank tops and jeans and sweatpants but whatever you say
more variety retard
its pretty warm in school so its fine
@Magical Girl Lith what gender is neand im curious
GG
i have a hoodie for outside
country?
show your copper stash
im blind ok
oh my god
this is
the fucking
end of my sanity
whats usually the weather
its like around 5c
what happened to this gc being 4 people for 3 months
tank top only if it isnt cold af
some persona twink idk shit about him but theres some relevance to gloves
obv theyre not unless during/after forearms but still way bigger than before i started working out
a paper cut on the forearms would kill me
no big veins on forearms looks cool af
unfortunately biceps veins are only really possible during workout
explain the reference
do you have a fetish for having a shit body
god knows how zeldalord would look like if he didnt walk in belgrade for 8 hours every day
when does the situation of papercuts occur
i have never gotten one idt
my favorite game is persona 3 reload
what
nah its better than skyblock
isnt this fire
wdym
zelda you can have massive dragons
that either shoot fire poison or lightning
ITS SO COOL
a poison wyvern
doesnt it look great

@Pixel the final ark dlc is SO bad
i refuse to believe its canon or exists
its just 2 parts of the map
and both parts of the map are a generic copy pasted biome with zero verticality and just creatures bullshitted everywhere randomly because "le final dlc"
they bait you with the fucking promotion images so you think itll be like aberration but its just copy pasted unoriginal boring slop

how long has zelda been gone for
last time he responded to me was at 1pm
it is 10 30 pm rn
dont have it
no
its not bad
just maybe add something of a diff color to it so it doesnt look so bland but its not bad
when are they adding makoto yuki
dm me if u want all the irl info on a miserable french cuck (he made an insanely unfunny joke and should kill himself)
WOW YOU SPAWN IN INSTANTLY
WAIT TRUE
SUBNAUTICA 2 IS 4 PERSON
do u mean after its on steam cuz i dont have any consoles
sure tho
WAIT PIXEL LOOKS LIKE A WOMAN???
LMAO THAT MUST BE TOUGH IN EGYPT AHAHAHA
I SEE WHY HE HAS A BEARD NOW 😭
15 cents a month too important
the greed of the egypt
something something when you give a man a small amount of money hell want more and more
is he fucking dead there
so from my understanding
he fucks up everything then dies?
wait how many phases has this gc been through
first it was bedwars then it was neand goonsquad then it was archipelago
add my cat as just a retarded gray fatass
hes too lazy to go down the stairs
how many of these exist
do i make one for p4r
for DIFFERENT GAMES
oh yea @ZeldaLord
dont forget most important backlog
sometime after next week we gotta watch squid game
ive been told nier automata is the peak of video games
i need to buy it next sale
have u played it?
there was a p5 collab, yes
sensitive topic but
im trying to contact the french gooner
and he literally isnt responding after 278 pings and hasnt talked in any server for like 30+ mins
im pretty sure he fell asleep while gooning to dungeons.
what song
i need more music to get into
why
dont worry i wont goon to it if its some franchise zelda likes
oh thats the pjbw song
@Pixel
you know thst song which is like 6 songs together on the playlist
that was peak pjbw
when i play automata i will make so many md references @Pixel
also im pretty sure
ive heard this song
in the 2h aot rewrite video
YES THIS IS THE ONE
HOLY FUCKING PEAK
is all of the automata music this peak
hsve u played it zelda its my friends favorite game of all time
persona v2 tr
ive been wanting to for a while
thats prob for after er
maybe to bridge the gap between er and sote so i dont burn out like i did for ark
is that required
if you die to one do you have to redo it
i truly hope theres not many gauntlets in elden ring
gauntlets give me ptsd
wiat thst backroumd
i fucking love ruined overgrown city aesthetic
pixel have u seen the version on yt thats a transition from keep your faith to throw your mask away
is the watcher actually something that will release or silksong
holy fuckibg peak
and yea ik rw has that shit in it
isnt the third one shit
bo
no
the in the labyrinth
subnautica 2 ending
oh it isnt slop which one was slop again
yea this one is the worst
original better than p3r tho
the p3r one is not miserable and depressing and hopeless enough
while memories of the city is
> **persona**l thing
no offense carrot zelda prob has more money than youll ever have
are you flipping cards
the 10 cent cards
...
@ZeldaLord is there a ultrakill greed layer
egypt
final boss carrot and pixel
WHAT
CARROTS PYRAMID OF GREED
na
"clair de soleil"
is that a reference to the song lmao
also pixel whats the game jam prize this time around
i thought it was a bit
and that was 4 months ago
ive never seen anyone get excited over 15 cents to 5 dollars
4.5k???
as in dollars???
WAIT IT WAS LUCK BASED???
LMFAOOOOO
I THOUGHT HE ACTUALLY COOKED
IT WAS LUCK BASED???
what a reliable source of income
cf raffles
in 15 years youll be telling your wife and children "JUST WAIT ON THE NEXT GAMEJAM WELL STOP STARVING JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME"
insecure ass
😭
"back to the grind 😈" ahh
they already know im the average gymtard
its an inside joke
@ZeldaLord
is there a way to see what others are making
i really wanna see some insanely complex mod that someone worked on 24/7
carrot didnt even win a raffle
hes 17
ur 20
are you making ultrakill
mod
THE FUCK IS IT THEN IF NOT A MOD
you show someone whos never had the thing they desire and theyll just want more
greed of the egyptians
it can be gained back by carrot and pixel working at a retail store or doing manual labor instead of delusionally making mc mods
carrot i hope you know
the only time i ever showed my friends anything from discord
was the 15 cent flex
they also know who zelda is
becsuse they see me talking to him all the time
no
im only on discord when moving classrooms rly far apart
WHY DO YOU WANT THAT
sure
but will it be like the last pjbw?
where carrot left the first gamr?
i always hopped on except one time which was before a biology exam
me too
im in bed lmk when to get on
do NOT
do NOT
memories of bw
its what introduced me to persona
the reason i played 2 persona games stems from its going down now autoplaying during core because it was on the playlist

fein fein fein fein fein
knew everything perfectly on the chemistry test and i first found out whats on it at 3am and studied under 2h
im him im god
i never got a response for the sheep
@ZeldaLord im gonna cut myself then hang myself
how
what.
nah what he actuslly is doong it
LMAO HE LOST
the pj dorm
this would be a lot like
pj sees
you would be the real life makoto
who
else
lives in those
@ZeldaLord OK LAST ONE
WHOS THE TRANSFER STUDENT ZELDA
ben already lives in austria and i live right next to it
youre the furthest away living from it
youd be
just like a certain transfer student
@ZeldaLord i was tryijg to think of who would be the mascot in a pj sees but realizes koromaru is sane and not like teddie and morgana
if pj was it or pt pixel would 100% be teddie or morgana
their personalities line up well
zelda the last one wasnt even about you
it isnt fun saying facts when you just instantly deny them
wait wtf
i looked it up and some dorms have gyms??????
holy fuck i need to live in a dorm not in an apartment for uni
why is it the most miserable
how well do u know german
oh mb i just realized that gyms arent the rarest thing ever and actually everywhere if you live in the city
you say it like its a bad thing ISNT IT SAME FOR YOU
zelda i already have one im just waiting for this week to end
no my retarded brain thought gyms are the rarest thing ever
but then i realized itd becaue of where i live rn
zelds
it is genuineky so hard
to not comment
just so you know
since when does carrot know about p5???
THATS WORSE
HOW DOES BEN KNOW ABOUT PERSONA
ok so
||theres a cat living there||
and
||joker works at a cafe||
thats why i spoilered it
am i more rotted that pixel
also is pixel just gonna do uni in egypt
pixel would look around atms for money
wait zelda this reminds me
when i was in middle school one of my friends' sister would fucking look around for money everywhere
she was also retarded and failed fucking middle school like twice
literally female pixel
how much
WRITE ME AN ENDLESS SONG
WHEN YOU LET GO
AS I FEEL SO ALIVE
KURIKAESU SOUL PHRASEEE
historypex time id win
how youre 17.
reuse the gooner model
zelda would hang himself if i put smoke some drink some pop one on full volume
i dont sing
irl
miserable
hiii zelda
lets play bw!
:D
he probably failed lmo
@ZeldaLord he actually fucking failed lmao
@ZeldaLord
i got baited for the sheep
genuinely no words
im gonna cut myself
pixel would NOT get to pjhq
he failed twice
that is so miserable
also didnt he mention he was failing egyptian this year
same hting
im ready to fake being sick any time
so i can buy the sheep when the guy logs on
yes zelda
yo uheard that right
ill be faking being sick for skyblock
point and laugh
you genuinely need to be retarded to fail anything in hs
closest ive gotten to failing was the 50% biology last year
but i really wasnt caring at all
and thats one class out of 10+
most were a 1
zelda i have a 2 in biology rn
thats an insane improvement
i just need to keep it up for the second semester
you have german as a subject in serbia??
i also need to lock in on german
still tho i hate oral exams even if it was in english
really hope those dont exist in uni
wed win probably
but honestly im just gonna try learn completely fluent german so i dont get discriminated against
i can probably pass as a normal german
although english first name
you wont really be able to pass
your probably named something like Novak Djokovic
vienna is a really nice place btw
id say settle down for the rest of your life material
ive been there a lot of times and i really like vienna
well all fit right in!
why are they dressed like retards
no
i would never wear shorts
can you even transfer with failing 2 times on your record,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LMAO
that is so miserable
hes one big failure
something something natural selection will get him
i almost failed one subject
pixel failed an entire year TWICE
big difference
wait of the world
he would need a LOT if he really wanted to go to uni
someone who fails twice should just work manual labor 😭🙏
probably carrot
carrot is the type of guy to just die first
the hot guy who dies first
if pixel went to vienna and didnt live in pjhq hed come kill and eat us
how much persona merch would pixel have
if he was from a first world country
that akechi plushie..
yea im talking to him rn
@Carrot
what age did you start
hs
LMA
both???
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord
pixel lore drop
so
i was 100% right about pixel having no friends irl
very obvious by the "i hate people"
"silent in school"
remember when i said hes probably like that one guy who noone acknowledges and never talks
i was right.
nothing just funny to see i was right
we dont judge here in pjbw gc
yea fuck you pixel
im not nearly as bad as pixel
ive never made a fumble like that in my life
also pixel has NEVER broken a bed in his life
ive already told you
that one time when i keot throwing
was intentional bait
weve been over this
yes i remember
its been so long carrot
just let it go
same for cope
@ZeldaLord what do the colors remind you of
that happened once lmao
wdyt of this one
its my favorite in the game and im buying it next
what about this on
i really like this one too
what about the piss one
i dont like it really but im getting it so its a full set
i mean it is the most expensive and popular one
i bought it for 8b today
do you like it
show
GGG
when is it on steam so me you and thomas WIN at it
!???
we can tie up zelda and force him to watch it
i just
subconsciously randomly did the infinite void finger gesture
it are

"pjhq"
ghpst
kys kys kys
zleda how tf do i kill the evergaol blood knight guy with 34830989 hp with a fucking wooden bat
the game is horribly designed
the other place is filled with knights and trolls
zelda i cannot kill anything
i assume you get armor by killing shit
my damage is pathetically low
THE GAME
DOESNT EVEN EXPLAIN
THAT THAT EXISTS
OR THE KEYBINDS FOR IT
yes
ill prob just have to watch a tutorial to actually play the game
but horrible design how you get told nothing when you first play
thatd actually be better
especially that map
@ZeldaLord one of these for the enderman?
worth the same
ill watch a quick tutorial tmr
and then go back to it
kys!
"all my childhood"
i got into sb at like what 13?
only other game id play before was just singleplayer vanilla or w irls
also skywars hardcheating in 2018
god was that fun
what class did he select
u can t run it
ahahahah
I HAVE THE ONLY CLASS WITHOUT ARMOR
youre telling me a wooden bat would do more damage than a fucking sword?
also zelda I GET ONETAPPED
i wouldnt mind if IT DIDNT TAKE SO LONG TO GO BACK TO IT
WHY ISNT THERE A GRACE AT THE EVERGAOL
what
does ds839 have one worse runback?
its still like 2 mins to get back
@ZeldaLord lets do coop er tmr
we both start with nothing
@ZeldaLord thoughts
see this is why you suck
youre fucking worthless
useless depressed serbian
useless depressed fat serbian
useless depressed fat friendless serbian
useless depressed fat friendless antisocial serbian
useless depressed fat friendless antisocial hk fan serbian
the list can go on and on
just end your life already
youre worthless you serbian waffle
you live in fucking serbia
if you think youll achieve anything in life youre delusional
keep gooning in your balkan little shithole
you goon with a poor egyptian
because you have something in common
both of you will never achieve anything in life
youll spend the rest of your miserable days gooning to dark souls 2 while eating bacon fries
second time
and its justified im really mad fuck you kys die
COOP NOT CARRY
I HATE SINGLEPLAYER
itll be more fun than watching a guide
because the game tells you nothibg
waste of limited time that i dont have much of
i have like 4h to play a day on weekdays
i dont want to waste it all on no progress because the game is badly designed
i played ark and won
because the game actually tells you shit
no its not "hard" that youre told nothing its BAD AND LAZY GAME DESIGN
also my game looks blurry kys kys kys kys kys

@ZeldaLord clair de lune
i recognize this music lmao
how so
zelda i shower every morning
whatever you think
@ZeldaLord APPARENTLY I WAS SUPPOSED TO PRESS SLABS IN OTHER LIMBO LEVELS THE FUCK
also @ZeldaLord
youre hard baiting about p ranking everything
so you magically knew where all the skulls were on your first playthrough ever
and got perfect time?
just looking for shit takes time
WHY DOES V2 COPY WHAT I DO
oh thats free lmao
first try
wait i got a new arm
wait is this a bug or does that mean v2 is still alive
lust
excuse me
who.
@ZeldaLord
ok but who tf
anyway carrot
this serbian cuck is making fun of me for not p ranking everything
(im supposed to know where the secrets and skulls are and the entire map layout too)
10/10 bait because i actually believed it at the start
oh what
they take SO MUCH extra time
@ZeldaLord should i go back to limbo for the revolver
why is carrot allpwed to not buy it
im broke too zelda
i genuinely dont have the 25$
hk was the 20$ that i have saved up in steam wallet
and now its gone
i am genuinely broke irl
just gift me it
no it was bait
im broke
@ZeldaLord gift me uk
do you not have thoughts then
ok and
did i ask
anyways
i have 0 money
@ZeldaLord gift me
zelda i can barely afford food irl
@ZeldaLord
gift ne
dont you pity my horrible living situation
be nice and cheer me up with a steam gift
all my meals are bread zelda
i cant afford anything else
like im fr
i can get people to vouch
im genuinely underweight irl from not being able to afford food
"""ask"""
as i said it was leftover steam wallet funds
i dont have any money
from 2023
yeah? and i bought with that
i made up the bank ahit it was waller dunds
PIXEL
PIXEL FUCKING KILL YOURAELF
AT THIS FUCKING TIME YOU REALLY SHOULDNT BAIT
IM TRYING TO GET ZRLDA TO SYMPATHIZE WITH MY ATROCIOUS LIVING SITUATION
HES FAKING DMS IGNORE HIM
PIXEL
IM GOING TO FUCKING DOXX YOU EVERYWHERE
MR MOAAZ
@ZeldaLord
did you know i actually live in an apartment
very small apartment too
i really have no money
buy me ultrakill please
@ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord @ZeldaLord
pixel dms
doesnt miyazaki have a poisonous swamp fetish
WAIT DID HE LMDAO
how many does elden ring have
omg i cant wait for the lake of rot
thatll be so fun
ive seen vids on it
@ZeldaLord would u say violelnt p rank is harder than er
which should i do first
first of all im obv doing standard p rank
and any rank p1 and p2
then all p on violent
why
why is zelda being a cuck i havent talked to him in like 3 days
whatever did i do to him
yes but not to zelda
you and pixel ok but not zelda
no i dont even hate him
im just being petty and i wont let him see any of my ultrakill gameplay ever
because he was so invested in seeing it
he literally 7d timeouted me because i didnt buy the game so he wouldnt be able to see my times
also is p1 a boss or a level
ok ill rephrase
is it 
1. gauntlet with boss at the end (like 1-3, 4-2, 5-2...)
1. just boss (1-4, 4-4, 3-2, 6-2)
youre an object pixel
a sex object
how hard is p1 compared to 3-2 btw @Carrot
pixel is a femboy close enough
FROM BEHIND YOU ARE
IF I CAN SEE NOTHING YOURE A WOMAN OK
IF I CLOSE MY EYES YOURE A FUCKING WOMAN PIXEL
if i close my eyes and cover my ears
theres nothing gay about it
zero masculine traits
just a hole
read
i like you thats why :3
who said it wasnt
im tying you up and gagging your mouth
youll be just a hole
and it wont be gay
yes youre probably fucking malnourished
i actually
workout
unlike you you dont eevn eat
that was back in ohd
i bulked for the entirety of 2024
no pixel i went from very underweight to normal
carrot we should duo p2p together
through some mod or something
as i said im actually buying the game
so everyone will be able to see the full p rank violent which ill be doing
yes
it wont look good at the start.
thats why i removed you.
nah its only for zelda
its just that youd instantly send it to him
how did it
YOU CAN RECORD A FUCKING STREAM???
genuinely noone would bother opening obs or nvidia pixel
is it like a discord feature
because absolutely NOBODY would fucking open obs or nvidia for a discord stream
i WONDER what the cuck is saying
i love being the second coming of osama bin hitler for not knowing discord has some obscure feature to record streams
oh it wasnt that
Started a call that lasted 17 minutes.
oh my god
there is
no way this is real
ive never played rythm games
ill do casual version then
wheres the video
how long am i suppoed to then
WHAT
@ZeldaLord GOT A BIT THROWN OFF BY THE
YK
@ZeldaLord how high were the people making this
this is the funniest shit ever
there is no way
THE LAST ONE
LMFAO
i didnt know pixel could be actually funny
also isnt there no voice for makoter
@ZeldaLord why does this actually look cool
i cannot
oh my fucking god
pixel can i have some context to rhis game
this is peak acid trip
when does this happen
ok demo over
wait why is the 24 hour cinderella game called yakuza 0
why 0???
@ZeldaLord
this is very stupid why is it called 0
:3
is it really worth looking at furry shit just so you can send it to someone else?
oh so like jjk 0
is it a good game
jjk 0 was peak way better than jjk
which slugcat is that again?
wait @Pixel funny thing
which iterator would zelda be
(we both know the answer)
true
oh shit i forgot
i was crashing out on archi
ok so for the allegations
1. youre outside just exploring the same city after school every day like makoter
2. u dress and look like him (thats why you dont say anything) 
3. you lean more into being introverted 
4. likes same food and bad ramen = p3 ramen
5. ive already made a pj as social link arcanas with zelda as the (new world) fool list so refer to that
6. both dont have much enthusiasm, excitement and happiness in their voice
7. goes to school sleeps in school and has school take a while
8. around same age
9. both are a ""leader"" of a schizo group (sees = pj)
10. has a pet animal (koromaru = retard)
ANYWAYSSS
im literally akechi
convince me otherwise
akechi = me
just got this recommended...
whyy
is that furry shit
also zelda ill give you money
if you tell me a serbian version
of makoto yuki
@Pixel I FOUND ZELDAS TIKTOK
explain this then.
LMFAOOOOO
@Pixel it is time
something important for the allegations is
all the zelda makoto edits
ZELDA DID A MAKOTO VOICEOVER???
SEND
I NEED TO SEE THIS
it is important for the discussion
ok what if i begged for something
you know exactly what i need you to voice.
zelda if you want me to do ANYTHING
literally ANYTHING you could ever ask for
i expect a akechi rank 8 voiceover
no
also lets entertain the possibility of pjhq for a second
i am literally goro akechi irl
i would grow out my hair and dress like akechi
and completely act like akechi too
should i start acting like akechi from persona irl
minimally of course i dont wanna be a dick to my friends
just some direct quotes and mannerisms there sometimes
irl rot references
(ive done this before)
jjk has ruined my vocabulary icl
permanent changes
why japan names
actual fucking weeb
just use.. non american languages?
all yapan is boring
where is the game even set pixel
who
all in le head is SO BORING
show your own art im curious
why
so you make fun of me for skyblock cope
but youre insecure in the shit you make yourself???
who has a weak personality now
whys there a fucking kill yourself bottom left?
thats rude dont you think
@ZeldaLord this fucking rots
zelda pixel
whats the famous akechi quote again
is "ill be entirely honest with you: i hate you" accurate
funny scenario to use it in rn
did you come out yet
oh yea did you ever end up asking for p5 for your birthday
oh my bad her egg hasnt cracked yet!
what did u get for birthday then
when youre ready, well love and support you
its ok take your time

FUCK YOU
I DIDNT REALIZE
YOU ROTTEN FUCK
why
sparks?

zelda you should take after onion and start dying your hair
maybe start with a nice dark blue
@Pixel
PIXEEEEEL
WAAAAKEEEE UUUUPPPP
I WANT TO KILL MYSEEEEELLLLFFFFF
theres limbus rot in the same post btw
guys i just have a SLIGHT feeling zelda actually likes being compared to makoto because he thinks hes a cool character
no dont think of anything
if im anyone from persona im akechi
not fucking makoto
oh i thought meant you said me and pixel were projecting onto you
if not then i can explain why
you keep asking for these lists to """disprove them"""
no, you want validation as to why youre like makoto irl
well i have 28 days to learn how to read
28 DAYS UNTIL FLOCHFORSTER BLACKMAIL LEAKS
truly was our palace
palace of greed
do you want me to read the entire akechi rank 8 crashout in vc tmr
just so you know my mic is comical levels of broken
carrot said i sounded ai
whyyy itd be fun
if you dont wanna vc i can just record it for you
when are we getting the waffle face reveal
zelda do u want my face reveal
i also remember that it was funny asf
@ZeldaLord say ANYTHING ill make it a persona reference
you caused me
so much sb trauma
theres this sb pedo whod dm 14 year olds "are you a sock?" (im not saying what hed say next)
and architecthor started randomly saying sock too
ok anyway its time
ok maruki DOESNT wear socks on his wear sandal things
how
how
what would be then
@Pixel

p4 and sub i got bored of, new shit i tried i got bored of, dont even have the motivation to workout or run
and if i dont today i lose my streak so thats just fucking wonderful i hate everything
i saw this on yt today

Battle Against A True Hero Ultimate Mix (Final)
The final Ultimate Mix of Battle Against A True Hero because why not end this dedication with a proper mashup? (And yes, I added one more.)
(I never intend on making money off of these, so support the original artists by supporting their channels)
Used themes:
never got past sans
so i just watched on yt
oh ye i need to do pacifist..
when i did neutral i thought that was pacifust but nope
yes i just reset i couldnt bother w sans
undyne was insanely hard too
i was doing that once at 5am and then i went to school and forgot until rn
i still have no idea how true pacifist ends
yes im doing that rn
papyrus and undyne phone call then i reload and go to true lab
my first first run was neutral (killed toriel and papyrus and randoms)
wtf is utry
did u misspell uty
explain
LMFWO WHAR
THATS FIRE
I NEED TO PLAY THAT
that is so fire
how so
im at mad dummy pixel.
what route first
what then
bird?
what then
oh.
what route is bird then
show boss
tf
send me a vid
ok that looks way harder than fucking geno undyne
whats the difference between normal and deluxe even
how the fuck would you know cuck
wait fuck this means that any reaction images i take off the femboy rp subreddit can be traced???
youd kill yourself if you did
im so bored
@Pixel what should i do
finally someone who agrees
i dont feel like playing videogames at all even if multiplayer
man
im trying to find smt to listen to and i skipped everything except trs
of like 100+ songs
ever been in the state that
you cant do anything not even sleep
yea i think there is genuinely no hope for me atp
i love you skyblock
ok wtf
i thought ark was a toxic relationship
ark mightve been annoying at times
but never caused me pain and grief
looking back on it i can gladly say all in all it was a fun experience i dont regret
but i wish i NEVER got into skyblock and NEVER met anyone from skyblock
maybe
thats the distraction i need
i will schizo up a story
actually no ill finish that one from 2021-2023
oh THAT song fucking autoplayed
kill me
personally
i just love making immortality an utter curse
the person is SUFFERING
do you have any time fucky wucky shit in your story
how involved is he
does he have access to the timeline
and are there alternate timeline versions of him?
i think its time to run while relistening to the entirety of 808s
perfect depression activity
also
make him utterly miserable and pessimistic and hopeless
pixel
if you use alternate realities well
they can be the most interesting thing imagineable
think of the possibilities, pixel
its not just "in this alternate universe everyone is a woman with big tits"
personally i like to use alternate realities where its all the same
but what makes them change
is changing something in a timeline and returning to a point that existed in a timeline without that thing happening
making a completely new reality branch out
two shot
what do you mean marvel
you mean loki finale?
no it really isnt like that
because theres no threat of the alternate realities colliding or anything
but when one person has the power to control them and is aware of all of them
shit gets fucked
and eventually people realize theyre what the 4th or 5th or 908th version of themselves
and begin to question evertyhing
small issue that happens at the end of the world
so yeah
through what
personally i execute this through a pocket dimension of time and space which theoretically contains everything that has/could have ever lived and that will/would be able to ever live
and when you mix that shit its just so fun
no i never used the future actually
it was the past and only like 4 times
and there were 2 "resets"
one was a week one was a year and a half
yea
same
it creates a different reality
and its their issue that someone is gone now
anyway the ending in very simplified terms is against all odds beating someone with access to everything (future is very subtle to make the plot work and it makes it a self fulfilling prophecy at the end) while the world is gradually ending through the span of less than 2 days, right after being sent 1.5 years back and slowly realizing that the """"protag"""" group is just old memories from the pocket dimension's database implanted into new bodies of a timeline just created at the point needed
so yeah identity crisis while trying to beat something that can only be defeated if it loses the will to live because it can just reset to before it died
i never did full on reality collision
clone you say?
an """""antagonist""""" which is the only other being with access to the connection of all time and space (yes i dont have some fancy name for it because im lazy) has clones to transfer consciousness into because it in secret pulled some clone bodies of itself into the main timeline
he can also regenerate if theres just a single cell left but unfortunately he died in an explosion as hot as the sun
which just nullified
mutated you say?
ok so the world in my case is
HEAVILY fucked up
the "mutants" (guess you could call them that) either have to go through training that treats them as utter shit and kills most for the strongest to serve in the military or theyre just fucking euthanized
the third option hidden and illegal is breeding facilities to enrich the power to esentially make supersoldiers (the most gruesome places imagineable)
a world slowly killing itself
i love that concept
ive used it a *bit*
and add into everything ive just said theres a more advanced civilization with way fewer numbers on a different planet that has gateways to earth and everything
they dont destroy eachother because theyre mutually very beneficial for eachother and both species can live on both worlds
but le racism
oh yea and they both fucking hate the mutants
theres also le religion
is thsi supposed to be the void fluid area
is saint's campaign just the end of the world
is there any ending where he dies
wait can saint ascend iterators
who the fuck made him
was that accounted for???
ok who made him
why did he become an echo upon ascending the worm
because it cared so much that it ascended so much?
whats the triple affirmative sliver of straw found if not saint
theories?
mass produced saint prototype
but what happened to ot
do we know if theres any left other than lttm and 5p
like alive
ye i js read the yellow one
wtf did she find then
fuck i still cant sleep
god forbid anything
pixel can i join the hating humans club
GOD FUCKING DAMMIT WHY DOES THAT ONE UTY SONG FROM THE PLAYLIST KEEP PLAYING IN MY HEAD
THAT FIRST ONE
I WANT TO SLEEP
first uty song on playlist
shodwon
no its showodwn
not that one
i need to stop bedrotting
i should like idk
god i want to hang myself so bad
i wish i could just not exist
literally just laying down doing nothing is so tiring and horrible
how can you help with 3-1
its a singleplayer game.
what
oh what game then
look my mind has been rotten by ultrakill SO MUCH
sb.................
@Carrot add twlw/twlr, trs, wwr, order, aoa, war, 7-2 ost, 7-3 ost to peaklist
@Pixel SANS X TORIEL ON MY TWITTER
THIS IS FULLY YOUR FAULT FOR EVER MENTIONING IT
hear the siren song call of death and danse macabre obviously
didnt name because one is long and one is in french
yea i meant this one
world looks white/world looks red, tenebre rosso sangue, war without reason, altars of apostasy
iirc the 1-4 was made by claude debussy who is FRENCH
therefore FUCK IT
ha ha ha how funny
no 1-4 isnt
and p-2 gauntlet isnt either
yes
wait what theres a v2 ost
im sorry i legit didnt know because he always dies in 5s
v2 always dies instantly zeldalord
gabriel and minos
no theyre impossible to instakill without insane deadcoin grapple goonery
first phase does
and i first tried 6-2 p rank
everything but p1p p2p secrets and challenges
i only got into deadcoining after finishing the whole game
also useless
believe what
its standard carrot
everything except 2-1 2-2 and 3-2 was first try
the tirst 2 because of weird spawn triggerd
i p ranked the entire game
ask onion he literally watched p2 stream..
im not on pc because it is 12pm
hey i p ranked everything up to 1-4 on brutal then got scared and went to sleep!
nah zelda this weekend
this weekend
im p ranking all of brutal
standard was way too easy
filths are annoying
and drones can be dealt with coins or a corenuke
i almost first tried sissy pissy but freaked out and died because i realized he had a 2nd hp bar
i was stupid
very stupid
i fell for that bait even in 3-2 originally
4-4 has one too
also minos is the best boss in the game but why does he have only one hp bar
flesh prison is the biggest bullshit ever its easy but its so horribly inconsistent
yes i had to learn on the wiki it instaheals if you do a shitton of damage to it but not the eyes
i dont have any issue with the boss anymore but its BY FAR the worst fucking boss because the game explains nothing
zelda you corenuke the first ones, and when they respawn your railcannon is still on cd..
the game never explained corenukes before
thats what i do but THE BLUE SKULLS ARE RNG
THEY WONT ALWAYS SPAWN
i just use saws my beloved then shove a jumpstarter in and shotgun swap
railcoin when its off cd
ITS THE BEST WEAPON IN THE GAME
IT CLEARS ENTIRE ROOMS
IF YOU PUT MAGNETS AROUND A ROOM AND KILL ONE FODDER WITH THE JUMPSTART THE ENTIRE ROOM OF FODDER DIES
ITS SO INSANELY OP
zero stragglers
you mean cannonball?
oh yea guys
how did you kill the fucking stalker upon first getting to that room
personally i setup like 50 frozen rockets around it, broke the idol and pressed right click
you can easily sisyphus phaseskip with just saws and jumpstarter
railcoin to dmg even the 2nd healthbar a lot
.
hp is same??
violent and standard is same hp
brutal is 50% more
that was when my playstyle was using one weapon and launching myself into enemies
PIXEL YOU SHOOT MAGNETS IN THE ROOM, HOOK ONE FODDER, JUMOSTART AND NAIL IT TO DEATH, EVERYTHING DIES
also jumpstart was INSANELY good for 4 cerbs room
made it free
true
i hate mindflayer room so much
i thought last room was hard but then i realized i can just edge the stalker by kbing it around with rockets
also that i can kill sentries with funny coins
ive even used those parries to damage the other shit attacking me
what do u do for that room then
kid named grapple
ye i did that for the last two obv
cerbs i just got together and nuked with one cannonball some fucking how
how did u guys do hideous mass i just revolver swapped from afar while dodging it like it a little pussy
no cuz i needed them for cerbs
is that the gigaretard strat
red shotgun i have barely used since i used it to carry myself through first 3-2 completion
red shotgun has to be my least used weapon
@ZeldaLord
did u do p2p without any deadcoin gigagoonage
grappling to reset the state is so fucking goony
ruins all the fun
fair ig
coin sounds are very pleasing yes
also is there any use for slab marksman i have never used it in my life
surely
ok what does it actually do tho
oh yea jackhammer thingy
what does that do
have never used it in my life
@ZeldaLord what is it
yea i havent ever used it either
why the fuck a shotgun alt
like hello i need my shotgunswapping and  corenukes
what strats
shit like clipping for speedruns is just no
deadcoins maybe
i havent even tried it yet
im just not because "clipping" gives me sb ptsd
which is a very sensitive subject for me
fuck you
youll never have a life
youre egyptian
youll live off instant ramen won fron game jams you cuck
fucj yku
im starvemaxxing rn zelda i cant rly care about flavor
except fruits
im getting to sub 10%bf by only eating breakfast and 2 meals and running twice and doing 2 core sets a day
basically thats what it is
i only do a protein shake for breakfast and the lunch and dinner are small portions
it looks very aesthetic but apparently youre fatigued all the time
and im already struggling with that
nah it looks so good
im obviously not gonna always cut carrot when i reach a physique id like to keep ill maintain (in normal people words eat like a normal person)
noone ive shown my face to has said im ugly
also noone irl
bro literally i look exactly how youd imagine
well, how zelda would
i unironically look like every tiktok gymtard
no im saying i look like literally everyone else who dresses like that
i videocalled carrot in 2022 once
but he wasnt on
soo how do u look like
pressing the button is faster
to leave call
true ig
but it worked for me that one time
why do you want to hide your face that bad
carrotus prime
hey i just vpnd
ive shown people my face before but im **NEVER** leaking my ip or general location
they have a lot of money its fine
pixel will just leak it everywhere no
the images are from the fucking shower retard
he doesnt have it
FUCK
yeah i didnt account for my fucking instagram
thats just a full name leak and school leak
no i just take pics after the shower because muscles look best after the shower
never sent to anyone
its just in my ego boost folder
on my phone
ive shown to some irl friends tho
but they asked
im not attracted to females
thats you
if theres any hot women in persona its sae and only sae
not fucking SUMIRE
i dont actually goon
to fucking 2d persona hoes
on my life i havent gooned since november 2023
how am i dead
i didnt send a message for 10s and im dead
its about the fact theyre not real
how
dw oomfie im overdosing on the 1y anniversary
HOW
shut up...
its also a p3 reference because takaya is fentanyl jesus
no its still p3 reference
shinji
actual retardation
@ZeldaLord @Pixel lets play something
lmao what
wait carrot were you there when we watched the entirety of sonic 3
that was one acid trip
HELL NO
NO GAY SHIT IN PEAKLIST
ok im fucking losing it
@ZeldaLord you were right all this time
about everything
except a few things
no no no andrej
i am the egotard here
not you
i am god buddy
i agree
CARROT
LIFE LESSON
ASSUME THAT ALL FRENCH PEOPLE ARE THE DEVIL
NOT JUST ARCHITECTHOR OR LECLOWN
ALL OF THEM
EVERY
SINGLE
ONE
days without french person betraying my trust completely:
i just noticed a pattern, zeldalord
french people are spineless cucks who do shit behind your back
he gooned
only thing that was my fault was trusting the guy who thinks sending people gay porn is the peak comedy
so about right
no i learned from my mistakes retard
i dont do taht anymore
very funny
retard hardcheats on skyblock behind my back
thats the tldr
i got back int oit
i was just about to log on when he got FUCKING BANNED
@Carrot can u report all the gay porn architecthor ever sent u
since seeign gay porn doesnt affect u much
youre not familiar with how skyblock players work
ok then the niko images he sent
you hate those dont you
i got banned for child safety for no reason last year
zelda im a minor
its pretty obvious
i didnt do shit
if you look on the discord bans subreddit
yo ucan see the sheer amount of false bans over child safety
its insane
first post tha comes up
also some random mexica nretard from skyblock got 2 child safety warnings in a day
sorry
ok guys holy fuck
i found the actual cure to depression
its 2014 fnaf osts
did you never
experience
2014 fnaf osts
as a kid
?
nostalgia
if you didnt then this actually explains why youre so miserable
2007
my favorite thing is when retarded people do something unintentionally that gives someone actually malicious blackmail 3 months later
yes both people mentioned here are french
no it was not me it was the retarded french cuck
he accidentally gave blackmail on me to a evil french cuck
i dont know france haunts my life always
its called pattern recognition
also the only autistic one here is architecthr
this is between a VERY serious conversation
@Carrot do u want me to screenshare 200k architecthor dms t oyou
i need to do it to prove a point
i need to fuel my ego
@ZeldaLord fuck
you were
right about
something you said in these past few days
cards you say?
whos that a reference to
kenji?
kenji is ugly as fuck, i agree
also horrible sl
horrible introduction to sls
OH
god im rotten
i need anti rot medicine
yes thats why i instantly deleted it
that shti was -1000000000000000000000 aura
yap yap YAP
im bored
zeld acan you say something funny
i need dopamine
im killing myself
wait
did you even intend to make a france reference
or am i heavily overthinking this
japanese
official persona 3 red fountain pen?
als oWHY DO YOU NEED MULTIPLE
zelda we know you have money but you dont need to spend it all
actually am i just greedy
because i refuse to spend anything if its irl or in a video game
wait upon realization
wow i cheap out on shit so much
let me show you everything i had leftover on p3r
on 1/31
"ill need it sometime"
i can disable images
on my discord
if you want
i just need to fuel my ego
im not explaining allat
@ZeldaLord I WANT OT KILL MSYELF
I WANT TO KILL MYSELF
I WANT TO FUKCING KILL MYSELF
LOL
i never used any of this
this is so aura
@Carrot do u like my almighty boost almighty amp telos that i used for elizabeth
IT IS???
thats so fucking stupid??
and im a murican
well i just lived there really
THIS IS YOUR FUCKING HOME
no i wasnt
also imma do all ultrakill challengesn ow
no
@ZeldaLord whats the v1 onetap again?
v2
im retarded
LOL
thats funny
god forbid people distract themselves in bad times
whats the joke
ok so
basically waht me and my friends do is
we draw amonguses with dicks on eachother's desks
in subjects we sit together in
LMAO
THE CUCK WHO FIXES OTHER'S SHIT
youre more like that polish guy with round glasses
the more i talk to you
why r u defending him
LOL
how much of a pos is the teacher
oh tf then
just randomly disrespecting normal teachers for no reason is gay
thats
so retaredd
do the retards in your class lack common sense
my friends might have horrendous grades but at least theyre not fully retarded
architecthor is the one who lacks common sense
"autoclicker is a cheat?"
is ti cope or actual issue everyone has
OH LOL
just randomly screaming is for middle schoolers not even
zelda are you in 5th grade or something
middle school is by far the worst part of school
everyone is on levels of retardation that shopuldnt be possible
i have some personal regrets of utter retardatio ntoo
thank god i finished middle school before skibidi toilet and brainrot became a thing
if i was born like a year or two later
i wouldve killed myselkf
@Pixel youre the one at fault
hed always have to "clean up" after any retarded shit we did but he wasnt forced into it he did it out of his own free will but complained about it
I DONT WATCH ANY UT SHIT
AND IT KEEPS POPPING UP ON ALL SOCIAL MEDIA
no he hated us
hes one of those act nice do shit behind your back people
biggest snitch in the entire school
and like zelda very introverted
i couldnt ever
i have to join in the fun even if its a bit risky
wait if they do
why do they keep doing it
do they do it every day lmao
personally im a professional skipper
number 1 faking being sick
the doctors buy all my bullshit
this is why im #1 baiter even irl
no not even personal doctor
if shes gone i just go to some random there
and fake having anything
the amount of blood tests ive had done
just to skip tests i didnt study
so do i not even need to larp being sick
can i just act casually
thatd be some nice qol
also i am NEVER forgetting the stare my history teacher gave me when i walked into school to take an exam (history was like 2h before and i couldnt bother showing up to anything except the exam)
thats the type of shit youd get from a drunk murderer in an alleyway
actual murderous intent
whos
whos pc
whos pc zeldalord
thjats me when im tlaking to you
i have this as my google backround in pc class
and my main dekstop backround is kid named finger
one of my friends has haram walter white
i told him to get it because thats what i used last year
@ZeldaLord what backrounds do u have on ur school pc
why are you so boring
because its dark?
do you ever go outside?
why so boring?
OK MAKOTO YUKI
genuinely miserable
wait is it to run
because i dont like running unless its in the morning or when its late
but otherwise i like going out when its day
how so
💀
i love cloudy days
but going out only when its dark or cloudy just screams emo
never kill yourself
Shiro

PRINCE OF SERBIA DRAGAN JOVANOVIC
you know what rot i mean
unless you have dementia
youre retarded
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE IN YOUR ACCOUNT
IS ZELDALORD SOME CRYPTO TRADER SKIBIDI SIGMA 1337 HACKER666.EXE
HAHA VERY FUNNY
YOU SCAM OLD PEOPLE
oh
thats retarded
look zelda as you know i dont have a lot of money
i wont be able to afford ultrkaill until like late may/early june
i have like genuinely under 5$ on my account
isnt that the name that pedos use for....
well i lied yesterday
if oyu dont know then great
i miss carrot im getting depressed again
@Carrot hii
talk about something
please
me and architecthor learned from that pedo we bullied
ASK HIM
RIGHT NOW
@Pixel see not my fault
not edited
we dont trust eachother one percent
no its not
the punchline is skyblock groomers
super isnt a skyblock groomer what
is that person you posted earlier
a "friend"?
id advise you cut all ties
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
NOOOOOOO
NAHHHHH
NAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
HES A FULL BLOWN PEDOPHILE WHO LIKES LITTLE 5 YEAR OLD GIRLS NOT JUST A GROOMER
WHAT THE FUCK
no this is actually
so horribhle
what the fuck
even worse pixel
he doesnt just groom minors because minors are easier to manipulate as i speculated
he literally likes kids
as in small kids
mine has been for the past 4 days
and is even more now
its not something
that normal people would know
after all i learned it from one of the most disgusting pedophiles ever
and the meaning of that word
is the msot disgusting shit ever
ok so
the main issue
wasnt getting the money
it was getting my parents to actually let me buy the shit
"NUH UH PC LE BAD"
(i had all the money needed)
no it was only 1.3k
and i had all the money already
zelda what would you need 500$ for
in a month
i just buy fucking food and shit
@ZeldaLord i literally have 200$ in my account WHY WOULD I NEED MORE THAN 500$ A MONTH??????????
youre just making fun of me to make fun of me
yes
to let me b uy on their card
AS IF I SET IT
as if
i set
the limit
youre not making fun of me for this
you never saw
500$ alltogether
in your life
youve never had that amount
coupe
a pedophile told it to me and archi
when we were in a sb gooncord
(for the record noone knew he was secretly grooming 15 kids until 2 months later)
he was comically bad at hiding being a pedo we all just thought he was making very fucked up jokes but no he was grooming 15 14 year olds all along
all like 30 of us were heavily retarded
because this guy was a groomer in the past
but admins said "le reformed"
and we just believed it
i still blame myself heavily for never realizing that shit
oh fuck
i cant pull up
the server msgs because i left
ill just send the like 2 dms i have with that nigger
even thats weird as fuck
like what the fuck
no carrot
bad carrot
serbian immigrant

@ZeldaLord thoughts on the pfp
kill yourself
wait i just realized why i have to change my name
and cant use floch on this account
the feds
the feds
the feds
KILL YOURSELF
@Pixel help me think of a display name
that isnt related to flochforster
THIS CANT BE FOR REAL
what to
i need suggestions
the feds
ok so
the feds are supposed to think im flochforster's accountshare
the second one
because the account owner doesnt cheat
"flochforster" is innocent
(the account owner)
flochforster does not have a dupestash either
anyway
need a new pfp
im bored of csmgoonslop
*Judgement
pixel wanna match pfps
i dont even interact with the feds
and havent ever
no more goon
i was doing le workout
PERSONA REFERENCE.....
go at a later time then
so youre like makoto
ok so like in persona
but still too full wtf???
just wear what makoto wears in the winter
or smt close enough
buy a new one
youre serbian royalty
it doesnt have to be 100% accurate
just close enough
zelda youre COPING
you cant tell me all of belgrade doesnt have a grey peacoat
im not in serbia
im in bed rn
remind me tmr
we need zeldamakoto to be REAL and TRUE
how long is your hair rn btw?
.
could you style it like makoto does?
@ZeldaLord FUNNY THING
theoretically i could style my hair like yu's except itd be a bit shorter in from the sides and back
then pixel does a ren cosplay....
@ZeldaLord what in the everliving fuck is yu's casual outfit
which the blazer tracksuit turtleneck?
thats the one i mean
cant find one guess ill get out of bed and load up p4
forgot how fire this scene was
@ZeldaLord
i have it but how do u adjust the camera
ok
wow i really gotta replay this peak
if ONLY i knew what a grey peacoat was called in serbian
сиви капут doesnt have much results
FRENCH?
yeah goodnight
im sleeping
too much
is "next direct" a real store or online store
ok name one or two REAL stores from belgrade
BEO Shopping Center?
THIS CANNOT BE REAL
ok
are "sinsay" and "s. oliver" real stores
@ZeldaLord what is gray peacoat called in serbian
i cant just type in gray peacoat on their website
its not an option
Sinsay - Great fashion, great prices | Kupujte onlajn
Otkrij najnovije trendove po super cenama u online prodavnici Sinsay brenda. Otkrij širok izbor proizvoda za celu porodicu!
kaput od sivog graška
is this right
google translate was accurate for once!
zelda youve not seen the flochforster graphic design
(for context we had to for some bs in pc class)
what
@ZeldaLord close enough
but uh yeah
this is like
bavaria levels of selection
i thought serbia wasnt that primitive
i thought belgrade was the capital is it just some random village in hte middle of nowhere
Rajićeva Shopping Center
this?
angry monk
isnt that what you mentioned today
thanks
this site is STUPID
it shows me all types of coats
also the serbian language fucking REEKS why do you speak this shit
fair enough
man if only there was an easy language understood by everybody that keeps bullshit to a minimum
does this work...
as you can see
the names are in serbian
no what makes you think that
its just mario characters
WHY IS THIS THE THUMBNAIL FOR AN ULTRAKILL VIDEO
AND THE COMMENTS IS A MD PFP
why 24th
will there be a discount or smt
im calling the bank tmr
pixel
is there any use/tech for screwdriver
i like NEVER use it
i only use for mindflayers because it makes them not tp for soem reason
HOW AM I EMO
AND ITS NOT MY FAULT HE DMS YOU
ZELDA THIS IS SUSPICIOUS YK
DO YOU TALK TO HIM????
@ZeldaLord dm
DONT LEAK DMS
FUCKING NIG
@ZeldaLord can you show me dms with architecthor btw
are you leaking pjbw chats?
are you conspiring against me?
no comment
oh ok
24 days until architecthor kills himself in vc
this really isnt about a block game ban anymore its about revenge
@Pixel in 24 days
should i use one of my many alts to screenshare it all go down in here
itll be the peak of comedy
because something i realized is he cares about skyblock FAR more than i do
it was such a spineless cuck move zelda
random anonymous report
what a spineless cuck
(it didnt even work because i am 1984)
yes absolutely
im fueling it completely myself now
because i want to
how much of that requires path of pain
ill prob play some hk today
i did some sisyphus practice and i can consistently first try him now
so just the gauntlet left
when roblox tho
standard but i only practiced for like 20 mins
and hes way harder than minos
@Pixel
@Pixel a friend told me he playe hk multi once
lets go do that
fuck you zelda now i have to go watch both of them!
does pop and pantheons count
why does kovre have 2x my uk pt and has it as not recommended
its the most recommendable game ever who wouldnt like it
isnt p5 batshit insane
@ZeldaLord how hard are they
how do they make that work in the lore
is that the final boss
@Pixel is that a p5 completion
how hard
@ZeldaLord should i even use my dogshit pissowners from the old save 😭
how long did that take you..
yes
look it was always my backup plan to replay p4 when i got depressed
its not the only thing im gonna play either
RISE JUMPSCARE
"man i wish there was a game that was peak fiction"
persona 4 golden:
lmao
zelda i was a p4 hater before i played the game
like 15h in i realized that its PEAK FICTION
you do realize how often i glaze this game
god forbid someone invests 4k hours into skyblock
and is rightfully mad when a ignorant cuck rapes it all
INSANE TIMING
you had 3k hours and lost 6b
i have 4k hours and lost 160b
not the french
the two french hate eachother actually
i only thought you and architecthor conspired against me
also the feds have existed since before
"the feds" is just an overexaggeration
CANT CHEAT ANYMORE
CANT CHEAT ANYMORE
CANT CHEAT ANYMORE
CANT CHEAT ANYMORE
CANT CHEAT ANYMORE
CANT CHEAT ANYMORE
CANT CHEAT ANYMORE
CANT CHEAT ANYMORE
CANT CHEAT ANYMORE
CANT CHEAT ANYMORE
ITS FARMING ZELDA ID RATHER HAVE A MACRO FARM FOR ME THAN PRESS BUTTONS FOR THE WORST """GAMEPLAY""" IN SKYBLOCK
I WAS GONNA START DOING FISHING AND BLAZE AND XP (NONE REQUIRE CHEATS)
WHATS THAT A REFERENCE TO
HL???
anyways
im most definitely just self wiping the day im unbanned
killaura in hub 1 = 360d ban and wipe
ill stream it from another account
on my laptop
thats exactly the reason
i care a lot but its the only thing architecthor has in life
the pathetic cuck
wanted access to his hard work even if we wouldnt ever play again
thats how much he cares
im not getting into more priv shit but itd be so genuinely traumatizing if i just called him and showed him selfwiping and 360d
le foreshadowing
WOW THE FORESHADOWING IS ACTUALLY GOOD
is it not obvious zelda? mastersilly has like 2k pt with 7b networth
complete shitter
to think ill never see it again..
its just
too tragic
zelda not to ego or anything
but just one item i got recently is more nw than you ever head
if you bought that light blue sheep zelda
its worth 170b rn yk..
[416] ⸎ [MVP+] FurryAF: 7m
@Pixel you
it was so beatiful..
thats 2y ago
💀
CHEATS DONT AFFECT SECRETS
???????????????????????????????????
none of us ever used autoroutes because theyre insanely bannable
and unfun
we barely ever played healer
architecthor got banned not me
@ZeldaLord i just cant ever part with skyblock
when i wipe this account ill buy a new one with like level 460 250b net and no status
zelda
itd be less than my pc.
I NEVER CHEATED
ARCHITECTHOR CHEATED
no ive literally had so much more money than that a lot of times
its so i dont get "irresponsible with money" or whatever the fuck
ill just save up
and in a few months
ill have a new account
better than this one
also ill have to get a new card and get it myself because my parents would never let me buy a block game account for 1.2k
yeah it was pity bait so youd maybe gift me ultrakill
i have a bit less than 200$ rn
i can try
i would win, pixelated_face
also considering im doing a calorie deficit instead of surplus rn
i dont burn nearly as much money on food
so its really free to get that money for the account
only real issue will be getting a trustable seller
that was 2022
july 2022
ill win
if i dont have an account
how would i not quit
YOU JUST DONT BELIEVE IN ME
unlike you and possibly the waffle i wouldnt kill msyelf
however i would delete everything online except steam if i ACTUALLY got scammed
but i wont
i will win
yeah but the internet sucks
HOW
anyway
everyone on the internet is a degenerate backstabbing piece of shit noone should be trusted on the internet ever
pixel you have no future
all you have is the schizophrenic games you make
taht noone wil lever see
money (i will never go homeless unlike pixel)
actual friends (ALL HUMANS SUCK WAH WAH WAH)
an actual good physique (pixel probably looks like skin over a skeleton)
pixel doesnt even have a chance to go to a uni or get out of egypt because hes so broke 💔
and considering he failed first year of hs TWICE
he shouldnt even try
also its important to move to a country that doesnt have utter dogshit pay
you can live in a place where shit is very expensive and pay is horrible
or a place where shit is cheap and pay is good (germany/austria)
excuse me the minimum wage in egypt is 138$?????????
WHAT
@Pixel dont mean to make fun of you or anything but what are you considering for a career option
and a plan to get out of egpyt
because
holy fuck
i have a year or two to figure it out
its fine
considering the it uni in vienna starts with very basic shit
ill be fineeee
i hate the fact that that uni is unironically a good option
nah im actually locked in now
if i keep this up until the end of hs im gonna win so hard
so whats your plan
im very curious how you plan to escape the 140$ min wage country
do your parents have money at least?
theoretically as miserable as itd be i wouldnt really ever have to work and im already in a good place (if i move a bit to the city)
but the pixellian situation looks horrible
never said id actually do that..
its just gonna be nice not having to do some miserable job during uni
so i can actually focus on studying and have free time
i need to learn coding and german
most importantly german because i plan to live in germany/austria permanently
i said its something i can do not something i would EVER do
i just said it to make pixel feel bad about living in egypt
id rather live on the streets than be a miserable leech
like why are we just ignoring context @ZeldaLord
have you just gotten used to it
because i could never imagine just living like that
but ig it makes sense you get used to it in 17y
yeah IVE NEVER PUT EFFORT INTO ANY PC SHIT
pixel thats middle school pc class shit
OH SHIT
i mightve
used the excuse i use irl
online
probably frontend
seems the easiest and least complicated
what
im playing p4
@Pixel oh yea one last questione
do u ever plan to move out of egypt
idfk
ill learn some basic ones this week prob
since nothing really in school
zelda ur like a billionaire right
what r u gonna do in uni
linguistics with a focus on the french language
i cant just lose it.........
i need my slop back................................
its been 6 days...................................................................................
no id rather kms
nice mistake btw
@Pixel
iteration
OH FUCK OFF
I WAS ESEXING IN KUUDRA GANG ON MY OTHER ACCOUNT
anyway
frontend is the visible and interactible shit
backend is the shit behind how it works and shit
see
no its just all i remmeber
its fine i can just play ark my entire life
and never worry about a thing
so many people.. playing pexblock..
i need my pexblock......
oh yea
this isnt even bait @ZeldaLord
i had a dream i was playing extinction but with ultrakill movement
just funny to share cuz itll piss u off
why
guys is there any way
to kill flesh panopticon
i wanna do that itd be funny
i did
on standard i p ranked everything but p 2
sooo
can we play rn
why do u have him ad ded
btw carrot did u see super goons to lolis on roblox
should i play some hk
i said p4g wont be the onloy thing im playing
hl2 was during ark
p2 was after ark
it does
i quit ark almost 2 months ago!!
the rot consumes
...
you had it coming
never ship me with the french twink again
in my defense he was provoking me
so anything i did wasnt my fault
I DIDNT DO THAT??????
@Pixel
isnt the "alpha" and "omega" shit
from that one okbuddypersona post
you told me to ask neand about
AHHAHA
THATS SO ACCURATE
i need to pirate nso
im not paying for the suicidal idol game
wait why does that fucking rhyme
what are the otehr endings
just sh?
is there a happy ending
what
i dont speak slop
give me 20-30 im abt to go run
LMFAO AO3
EW

@ZeldaLord TOLD YOU THAT PIXEL IS THE AVERAGE PERSONA PLAYER
EVERY WOMAN IN THE 25-30 RANGE IS A HAG
"""adult woman fetish""" as they say it on okbp
so Sae is likely in her early-to-mid-twenties.
"""""""""""""""""""hag"""""""""""""""""""
how am i a groomee
because i like
nvm
im 17 fym.
is it fucking super
dont tell me
OF COURSE
actually that could get me striked by discord
ive seen too many examples

i had to fucking send a face pic with id
to get it back
it was like late 2023 or smt
no
why
??? sumire is fucking ugly
stfu
ur the average persona fan 
hasnt played the game and only attracted to 16 and under
im unironically doing p4g replay and pq1 before p5r once
how..
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? cant you just reroll
ok im concerned now
very concerned
@Pixel how far into p3 are you
HE PROGRESSED THAT FAST WHUH
OK LETS BE REAL NOW
THE CHOICE IS OBVIOUS.
if you think sae looks like a hag youre genuinely a pedophile
no she looks ugly
especially with glasses and hair down
how
ok im actually
i actually have no words
makoto looks good but sae is just makoto but better
nah
yesss i love emo twinks
nijima

ZELDA??????????????
ZELDA??????????????????????????
oh

pixel said this
right before
oshi no ko?
LMAO
KNEW IT FROM THAT ONE SENTENCE
yes.....
did he just watch the anime or read the manga
the anime is sane
the manga has incest towards the end
I DIDNT EVNE PLAY THE GAME FYM
@Pixel BRO
THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED
EXACT SAME RESPONSE
he doesnt know who you are
i posted it cuz its funny
thats my other boyfriend
sane then
never let him read the manga
@ZeldaLord

NO???
she just looks pretty
only good looking woman in persona
shes in the interrogation cutscenes.....
I HAVE 32 HOURS
with didnt play the game i mean didnt finish it
wow last played december 1st that fucking rots!
hes making it up?
IM NOT IN THERE
IDK WHAT THAT IS
IF IT EVEN EXISTS
NO???
SHJOW PROOF????

LMFAO

some cowshed macroer got banned for gooning to her (shes like 14 or smt)
still looks like a child?
suspicious to say but ok
and very weird you specifically asked me this for this one character
did you goon, pixel?
what.
whats so funny
im killing myself
two can play this game @Pixel
LFMAO
LMFAOOOO
whyd you delete though
wb my status
hey you didnt crop it
its funnier if pixel posts it
thats why
KID NAMED LENSES
better than glasses
rude
@ZeldaLord i actually have no idea how this happened
it was bait for you originally
no im actually so confused
on how he even got the pfp right
this is how i got it
THERE ISNT AN ACTUAL SERVER
THERE IS A 1/1 BILLION CHANCE
THAT IT HAS THE EXACT SAME NAME
AND PFP
THAT I CAME UP WITH IN DMS
IT CANNOT BE REAL
ALSO
ITS NOT EVEN ONE OF THESE
ITS ANOTHER PERSONA SERVER IM NOT IN
ok pixel
screenshare the server if its real
Started a call that lasted 0 minutes.
show more screenshots right now @Pixel
@ZeldaLord can you not see that its some normal discord
that he edited
to be a sae gooncord
YOU EDITED ME INTO THE "AbareKillerDTG" GUY
YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE BOTTOM OF THE THIRD GUY'S PFP
zelda are you in on this too
@Pixel show more angles
wait actually
just send an invite here
thats easier
@Pixel come ooooon
dm me it then
@ZeldaLord see hes LYING
i dont?
show proof that the server exists pixel
more proof
go all the way to the top
member list and this part where it shows the banner
you cant be serious
why are you actually wasting time on looking through glasses...
@Pixel can we roblox
why
to prove its real?
there is
no way
its actually real
NO FUCKING WAY
ITS ACTUALLY
REAL
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
ITS ACTUALLY REAL????????????????????????????????????????????????
@ZeldaLord on everything

to affirm his sumire gooning now
HE DELETED IT
IN FRONT OF ME
rule 1
never open goonerius prime
RANDOM GUY IN ONIONCORD
I CAN NEVER ESCAPE SLOPBLOCK
@ZeldaLord
pixel is sending me loli ralsei
IM SCARED
is this sigma
i know
but how do you make the editing so good
what kind of retarded name is "2B"
are they robots by any chance
the murder drones from murder drones are named "N", "V" and "J"
LMAO
oh its the 24th
any uk discount?
at a serbian highschool
sorry i dont associate myself with slop.
mcdonalds or something else
NOOOOOO
anyway i still hate the fact i have to buy a whole new pc before november to play whats essentially ark's version of episode slop (it retcons the peak story into utter slop but the gameplay will be fun)
its gonna be an ice focused ark, something ive always wanted
i can probably just lie that my old pc died
but idk if theyd force me to buy a prebuilt in that case
oh i could also just
replace gpu and cpu
ill just say i cant play any new games because my slop pc is outdated
they dk anything about pcs and wouldnt fact check
ok thats a bit of an issue then
no they just have jobs that existed before you needed to know everything about pcd
PLEASE DONT
I SAW IT INSTANTLY ZELDALORD
PATTERN RECOGNITION
EVOLUTIONARY TRAIT TO AVOID **SLOP**
anyway
cpu wouldnt be over 500$
so i can buy that without them ever finding out
i can just say my gpu broke down since gpus actually break down most commonly
actually
why bother with anything
ill just get a new card
with no retarded limit
and buy the cpu and gpu
yes it is utter slop
white woman central
LMFAO
that has to be bait
and its very good bait
im gonna do that today lmao
fuck im in the city rn but i dont have a piece of paper
or a pen
or tape
wow thst actually looks good where is he
couldnt eat that rn tho im on calorie deficit
they have shit thst isnt slop???
no bro im getting to sub 10% body fat
yes idc if its unhealthy i want le aesthetic physique
zelda its near impossible to maintain sub 10 anyway
and if you do its probably very unhealthy
its just smt im going for then ill maintain around 10%
idc just dont send pictures
im already halfway there prob
im prob at like 15-12 rn
how is talking about physique retarded
wah wah i cant eat to gain muscle mass wah wah wah
thats u zelda mcdonalds has a dlc of body fat cap (just like in skyblock)
no life fucking sucks actually
if life was so "fun" why am i 30d banned
i wasnt a hater until the ban
FUCKING HELL
i felt empty even when i was out with my friends
nothing i mean nothing can replace sb for me
and its been a week
no this is the only time
i also just do not like burgers in general
for example theres some slop food for fat people that i enjoy (croissants)
also mint ice cream but only mint flavored
yea not saying it again
slop as in full of butter and other fat shit
but theyre good
#1 cheat meal
huh
arent baguettes??
also i unironically like baguettes too
i just try not to think about
the association with france
snails fucking suck tho
completely tasteless
dogshit food
utter sloppy slop
coke isnt that bad actually
yea because im lazy i season it
only the green shit does
nothing else
yes
i was in p*ris in 2019
traumatic experience
fuck you i run a lot and workout 6d/w
ive just gotten completely used to not eating seasoned food
like i do not mind it at all
yes i love steak
but it has to be actually cooked normally
never boiling thst shit
no
how the fuck would i not know
what a steak i
noone
not even me
FUCK QOL IT GETS YOU BANNED
IM NEVER USING ANY QOL MODS
no i didnt hardcheat
architecthor used 2 different macros in kuidra
also clientside blocks
no
blocks you can do shit with
i really want to.
now that i think about it
i should eat more steak
its so yummers
actual good food
oh my god
oh my fucking god
well
while i dont ignore carbs because i literally eat boiled chicken for this shit
CARBS ARE THE FUCKING WORST
SLOPPPPPPPP
what i literally answered???
its SLOP
what question
baguette sometime
just say it again i cba
this?
195 and 80-85
i LOVE raw salmon and raw tuna
cooked salmon is good too
but cooked tuna is eh
raw tuna best
nvidia stock something something sloppage
just explain
skyblock reference kinda
good bait
no i can just leech off my parents' money if i wqnted to
i will never live a sloppy life
can pixel do this?
will pixel not need to work a day in his life and not need to worry about financial shit a second in his life while in university???
sit the fuck down its 67k
its monthly
what do i need anything more for 😭
im still in highschool
ok years is crazy
but i do not need to buy anything rn
actually steam games but thats under 100$
ok so what does ben need it for
i can buy that pretty soon i think
like 2 months something
dont really need because my parents will pay for everything whem im in uni
im going right after hs
so 2y
i need to figure out what ill do...
no shit i play skyblock
oh no my life wasnt homeless misery why are you making fun of me for thst.
zelda im god of skyblock money
i showed you screenshots of all the skins i had
then i unfortunately got wiped for buying and hoarding duped items
meant skin economy and dye economy (dye economy died after they made dyes accessible to PEASANTS)
hell no
yes investment god of SKYBLOCK
i know how skyblock economies work not real ones
oh yea ben did you see they made stocks of stonks a fixed price of 3m last july
all the dupestashes of 1t+ in stocks DEAD
also architecthor is the absolute worst person at investing
thing slowly goes down
"it will go up"
thing goes down even more and faster
"it will go up"
reaches dogshit price and stays at it
"it will go up"
(((its been 8 months)))
no he really was very wrong
skin economy just depends on old stashes that hoarded skins getting wiped
the hex massacre of january 25th 2024 (killed my stash too) was the reason og sheep skins went from like 3b applied to min 160b applied
i need my pexblock back
LMFAO NICE EGO
ive never namesearched anywhere
and people call me ego
at least im not as bad as ben
@Pixel i dont have an ego right pookie pie
say i dont have an ego
thanks
anyway on the topic of food
@Pixel @ZeldaLord thoughts on blueberries
actual peak like what the fuck best food ever
no i just really like blueberries
@Pixel can you put me on some good shit
no offense dont you have like 10 cents
wait fuckkkk i wanna start investing too now the skyblock itch...
LMAO thats no achievement then 😭
i can do the same
hey white sheep skins sold for 1m in 2020 and now theyre 200b
@ZeldaLord wait ask him how this work
does he have to give the initial 50k to his parents or no
ok my 1.2k in april should work then
actually i should still ask for like 20-50k
as much as possible
i could make a lot of moner
BRAWL STARS SUBREDDIT
i can shill investing or something
they probably wouldnt really care
ITS NOT SKYBLOCK ACCOUNTS
probably less than zeldalord
maybe in egyot
is shit in egypt cheaper because the min wage is dogshit or nah
I DONT SPEND MUCH MONEY
WDYM
carrot
theres no guarantee im gonna get it
im gonna ask after some insane streak of perfect grades tr
might even go to one of those math contests or whatever
to further cement the point
its the thought that matters 💖
MF YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT CITY IM IN
why did i have to say anything
my parents are like asian parents kinda
the only thing that is important is grades and nothing else
yea im pretty sure its like that too
which could be very bad if you guys knew what city im in
unfortunately you dont
im not asian
its just the principle of "le perfect grades is all that matters in life"
anyway
@Pixel block tales or something

then go to the bank tmr
because i cant live without uk
THE REMODELS
ye
remodels and encore
pixel and carrot said harder than p2
wait zelda did you see when i was coping about brutal 3-2
that was real funny in retrospect
its also limbo encore
which im rly curious about
brutal?
is there anything worse than le mindflayer room
and le stalker room
is it only enemies from prelude and limbo
or all
yea its fire
@ZeldaLord HGOLY FUCK
NO FUCKING WAY
@everyone I HAVE ULTRAKILL
@everyone I HAVE ULTRAKILL
@everyone I HAVE ULTRAKILL
noone in pj has pirated uk anymore

why do u usei t
ive never used jackhammer
I NEED
MY FUCKING
WEAPONS BACK
i need my old save

i have the game now
wah wah wah i need my weapons
why
they changed schizms btw
they attack differently now
ok the cracked ver still exists
carrot i bought ultrakill
Started a call that lasted 0 minutes.
oop
"lying" IT DIDNT WORK
guess some things just happen randomly
prob?
the cerbs in 7-1 have 2x the health and 2x the size
cerbs when one (1) cannonball
are they gay (radiant)?
sooo how do i get files of this
WHAT
how did you get to 1-e so fast then
you did not
that fast
considering u dont have the full arsenal
@ZeldaLord how can i cheat in all the weapons itd be fun p ranking everything on violent real quick
@Carrot ok how did u actually transfer saves
yay my save is alive and well
waow
no
i just went into files of cracked ultrakill
only took me 13 mins
!!
4 cerbs instantly lmfao
confirmed?
is that a GUTTERMAN
OH AND A GUTTERTANK
GUESS EVERYTHING IS FAIR GAME
OPENNNNN
KYS KYS KYS KYS OPEN
@Pixel WHERE TF DO I GET RED SKULL
LMAO IDOLED MAURICE
RED SKULL ROOM
AGONY
THIS IS HARDER THAN P2
ok i won
OK THAT ONE ROOM IS INSANE
WHAT
ok i passed mindflayer room
guys i think they killed jumpstart
stalkers
dont
die
on
brutal
.
isnt this that elf you called "mommy"
you said "frieren has a mommy voice" no
WAIT FUCK
THAT EXPOSES ME TOO
@ZeldaLord
we get it
wait wtf this is unironically goated
ill use this on the french twink
can u stream pls
Started a call that lasted 0 minutes.
@ZeldaLord why did u leave call
i wanna see
@ZeldaLord add me on steam bestie
284 hours...
WAIT LAMO
i have silly added on steam
but his ultrakill times arent displayed
why does he hide them
@ZeldaLord ZELDA
VIOLENCE IS ALSO OVERHAULED
I JUST PLAYED 7-4
ALSO THE EARTHMOVER CORPSE LOOKS SO COOL NOW
WTF
PIXEL
YOU LITTLE CUCK
VIOLENCE IS ALSO REVAMPED
ok i played all the 4 levels
they all have new shit wtf
7-2 most lacking tho
?????????? screenshot
THATD BE SO FUN
@ZeldaLord its actually real
guys i just tried 0-s
even that got revamped
be more precise
which room do you mean
also imo 0-e was harder than 1-e
less spammy bullshit and gives you more time to think
the ||virtue hookpoint room|| (1-e early on spoiler) is one of the most hilarious and evil things ever
i am doing a brutal playthrough rn
im gonna do 3-2 as the last p rank
greed was free
although it was the first time i died (excluding 3-2)
because i simply did not know that stalkers survive after they first attack
are u doing encore on violent or brutal
it what
oh GG
i cannot imagine this shit on brutal bro
ok how fast do you reckon until they get patched
ill p rank everything tmr on brutal so i can use those cheeses on encore p ranks
to have le encore brutal p rank
let me know when you get them
while cheeses still exist i need to reach those on brutal asap and p rank them
why.
i want my brutal p rank encore TOMORROW
i wonder what encore levels and radiant enemies are in lore
PERSONA MUSIC
IN AN ULTRAKILL VIDEO
the mindflayer with heat room is worse
although thats a close second
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
im so retarded
0-1 or?
ye thats what i meant
that would be FUCKING INSANE
WAIT
I THINK YOURE ONTO SOMETHING
YK THE 1-E IDOLED HIDEOUS MASS?
I GOT IT DOWN TO LIKE 10% WITH THE RED SHOTGUN
its easier than 0-e
you get to actually strategize
instead of constantly getting bullshit thrown in your face
the radiant spawn noises..
youre kinda forced to fight them slowly
because god fucking damn that level of radiance makes them fast even on standard
i was just tryna stay in the air 24/7 thats how i first tried it
i cant imagine brutal with double shockwave and 50% more hp..
ill be doin it tmr tho
whats that one again huh
oh that one
1 click huh
what did you do for it
LMAO thats insane
prob gonna be used by speedrunners
oh yea how much worse are brutal guttertanks
ive heard guttermen enrage when shield broken
comedy
do guttertanks take extra dmg from rockets
honestly idk what takes extra damage
ik gabriel takes more from nails
which makes me realize how STUPID i was for using saws on him for the entirety of today
thats actually smart
i used that for gabriel prefire
custom colored weapons huhh
what mod is this and custom colored weapons
is there like a speedrun category for that
it is tbf
go play 1-e its actually peak
@ZeldaLord THEY ADDED A SHORTCUT TO GABRIEL YOU GET TO HIM IN 5S NOW
(3-2)
floch
god bless for this shit - Clipped with Medal.tv
Watch god bless for this shit and millions of other ULTRAKILL videos captured using Medal.
i thought you meant me yea
persona is something thats a fun game and funnier reference to me
for pixel its his entire way of thinking
i know this joke has been dragged to hell and back
but
le being in class le persona reference
thats just one of the biggest pieces of pjbw lore
i really have to get back into p5 when i finish p ranking all normal levels on brutal
i saw a lot of maruki shilling today
oh my god the ROT
the sheer ROT
is that your main concern
is the bigger concern not the fact its 349394893 people
its going to be pure and utter chaos
and if they reference okbp one more time im going to lose it
"fuuka friday"
atlus social media is
yeah id rather not think about it
isnt ken va like fully anonymous and shit
well
apparently a guy voiced koromaru
but hes yapan
because yk, you wont have a different dog voice for english
wait wtf
3 new persona streams
i htought he stopped doing them when there was no new ones for 2 months
@ZeldaLord yk what this word means?
wait WHAT
yes thats the joke
thats the joke
probably schizophrenia
do you know what the word in the green circle means though
wow
so you never watch the videos of yaoi fangirls in their rooms when you get them recommended or when i send them to you
anways the joke is gay hentai
i have no idea why that is in a fucking persona stream
@ZeldaLord wanna know another fun fact
"fujoshi" translates to rotten girl
the rot truly is everywhere
20 seconds in and they say pissowner
well i was gonna watch it anyways
i watched all the ones up to aigis one
then he just didnt upload one for 3 months
well start of the vid hes at 11/20
i am illiterate.
also funnily enough this is the character than inspired akechi
rot is everywhere if you know how to look for it.
LMAO THE MITSURU VA IS SYNCING IT
of course
i forgot how rotten these videos are
probably took "hire fans" a bit too seriously..
oh GG
like before they applied
or did they have to first
ok everything makes sense now
theyre just aged up first world country pixels
nothing special
wait good observation where the FUCK was koromaru during the crucification
yes
he saves them
he takes his explosive thingy
yea
close enough!
it looked like a textbook detonator
ok
11/3 and 11/4 was genuinely mental now that im remembering it all over again
wow ikutsuki is retarded
"start over" my brother in christ start over WHAT
"im going to be the god of the new world" thats literally nyx's role
its funny how besides giving them their evokers he wasnt even involved with takaya and jin's suicide cult bullshit
he was just schizophrenic
wait thats actually fire foreshadowing
i love when in the intro its thanatos in front of the moon which turns into an eye
this game was really peak fiction
yea that just makes zero sense
ok barber can go get hair products and tools and shit
but the client never moves
how long was your line of sight broken for
was your line of sight not broken at all
thats still impossible
nothing can happen in a second or two
is there any chance there wa smultiple windows
HM
wtf i just realized
the mitsuru superfan from okbp horny posting was in p3r too???
legit never encountered her
@ZeldaLord he changed outfits for ryoji
also i never realized how fucking gay ryoji was wtf
looks egyptian enough
what the fuck
youre so rotten wtf
ok just no
im a gymtard but even i know all the alpha and sigma male is utter bullshit
@ZeldaLord hear me out on this one
yes
LOOK JUST HEAR ME OUT FOR A SECOND HERE
ISNT THIS A GREAT REASON TO BUY A NEW PC?
wym with "tiktok bait"
SHUT UP
let me have an excuse
oh i didnt think it through that much
id probably get sent to mexico or something
i have architecthor's parents' numbers (blackmail prime)
as ive already said
all they care about is "le perfect grades"
CARROT
YOU DO THIS EVERY 2 HOURS
idts
yeahhhhh
nothing its just blackmail in case of blackmail
its counter blackmail
hes too stupid to realize that
so its good blackmail
no that was the OTHER french
architecthor got my account 30d banned from being retarded
what the fuck did he even go off
i tried once but there was NOTHING to go off except "andrej crnjin"
and i couldnt find any social media profiles
fitting for you because why would you need those if you dont have any friends
i found everything possible on a guy from one (1) face pic
how the fuck
would he find your exact location
with that
unless you meant he found the part of the city you live in
and not your apartment
did he find your apartment or general location
no that fagger doesnt even use social media because like our waffle friend, he has no social life
@ZeldaLord
if its just general location thats fucking free
yeah that is free
anyone can do that
i could do the same for architecthor but what the fuck do you even say
you dont speak german and i dont speak french
and not accurate
FUCK
oh great
some people almost found my old instagram once so i had to completely priv it
that was like late 2023 i believe
so now i just have to say that i lost the password to my old account as to why my new one was created like a year ago

WHY IS ARK ONE OF THE FIRST RESULTS FOR RW
it was worth the money
in the sense it was funny seeing zelda mad when i bought it instead of uk
actually playing would be torture
thats why i like uk
its simple
you just kill shit
@Pixel LMAO
should i play nso
is this pity bait for me and zelda
oh my fucking god
hopeless
what would it even be
fucking skibidi toilet parkpur
good job youll have some money but zero dignity from making utter slop
LMFAOOOO
if i could guarantee a permanent home in germany
would you
you too pixel
and zelda too
make it capitalize on the worst current brainrot
THATS SO BAD
whats the context
make it like those
dogshit parkour/obstacle course games where you control a woman and she eats burgers to make her butt bigger
but its skibidi toilet and hawk tuah or something
can u tell me the context please
what the fuck no
do make it goonerbait tho
12 yos would click on any goonerbait
inanomate object with a butt
and thats enough

gym class is so fucking eeper
i always skip it
nothing ever happens LITERALLY
you dont even get a good workout unless its running
like nty i dont wanna play some ball game ive never heard about
i just skip to go fuck around with friends
ok
quite accurate
true!
@ZeldaLord IS THIS WHY YOURE MUTED IN LETHAL
i view it like that
even irl i turn things into rot
english class is just finding rot references anywhere and everywhere
because my evil nigger teacher isolated me and im not even allowed to be on my phone
so i just stare into the void and listen for rot references
very in character
⁉️
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO
persona 4 reference
wait did this release before or after p4
i thought p4 invented mimic chests
and sb was a reference
how fucking old is that
@ZeldaLord anorexic queen we stan

Monk Unc OST
"it's just a game" - Ark: Survival Evolved Tribute
"it's just a game" -unknown
This is Ark Survival Evolved Tribute video. As many of you may know, Ark has seen a major decline in popularity, and so has my channel recently. The channel may be my mistake- but nonetheless here you are. An ark Tribute.
🥓 Thank you all for stopping by 🥓
Also, for more content, like brawlstars and ark base spots- g...
guys watch
i promise it goes so fucking hard even though its ark
ok fucking hell
I CANT JUST WAIT UNTIL NOVEMBER
I NEED SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR I NEED MY ARK SLOP DLC
CAN THEY FUCKING RELEASE IT FASTER
actually knowing their past releases it wont be november itll be like 2026
I NEED MY SLOP
lets be honest you didnt watch a single second of it.
god FUCK skyblock
i genuinely could not care less about skyblock
if i had my slop dlc
please release my slop faster wildcard im begging you..
this is the closest another videogame will get to episode slop btw
the dlc completely retcons the story of the original game
(the dlc is only for the remake)
but i need to consoom new ark content so fuck it
huh i dont anymore
considering the fact i turn into an autistic freak when someone mentions ark
and the fact i actually participate in classes now
also @ZeldaLord i finally beat depression
because im too good at the game
it was literally just not eating enough
thats why i felt like shit
not le block game ban
im buying a food scale today so i can do a proper calorie deficit instead of a glorified eating disorder
why.
why would anyone own that
that would also cost a ton though no
oh yeah i just remembered theres a peak ark mod that gets called the orespawn of ark
i was gonna play it with the french twink but now i hate him more than any other person online so i can finally go play it
wait these are cheap
why did i think theyd cost a ton
~~is there one for the makoto mp3 player~~
.
wait what the slop
you have to buy base game (45$), some extra slop and xp lore dlc (30$) then the map dlc (25$)
not to mention an entire new pc
that sounds like a fun project id fail miserably at!
get the makoto yuki headphones
zelda
any trains in serbia?
.
well isnt that just lovely!
you should try out your ipod on one of these
about what
OH
THATS A PERSONA 5 REFERENCE BTW
literally one of the first cutscenes
on the way back from school
train go boom people die ITS THE SAME
SHUT UP ITS PERSONA 5 KYS KYS KYS
oh
oh
its not a persona 5 reference its just tragic
oh yeah thats fucked up
how old was the building
whats the oldest headphones you own?
IN THE MIDST ITS SO OVER
I FELT WITHIN ME
AN INVINCIBLE FEELING
OF WERE SO BACK
is this a carrot and pixel reference
its been
more than a month and a half since i opened the game.
WE ARE SOOOOO FUCKING BACK
AAHDAWDHWQBHDABWHABAAHB
AHHHAHAHAHAHHAHA
HOW
HOW THE GENUINE FUCK
why go to murica
ive been actively avoiding going back except to visit relatives on the holidays
AHAHAHHAHA
NOTHING EVER HAPPENS
wait i should go watch those 2 vucic videos now
serbia lore looks mad interesting
how long
how accurate to his behaviour is vucic's physical similarity to the average chud meme
is this the same one
why does vucic have such a fetish for china
over the summer?
ill stay in europe because kendrick has a europe tour in july
ill def go to amsterdam and stockholm maybe lisbon since i havent been to those places yet
actually i mightve been
but i was way too young to remember
i was like 2 or something
floppa is in stockholm??
oh yea
theres also a don toliver europe tour
and the only france city its in is paris
why does only paris get recognized
which of these are you going to
yeah but germany and the uk got multiple cities
why
bro its both kendrick and sza
you hate good music
female rapper
but actually good
she also does more mainstream music
so idk how you dk her
yeah idk what rock u live under
oh yea kendrick is gonna hit 110m...
and 100m was an insane milestone already....
"serbian progressive party"
how progressive is it actually
LMFAO
LMFAO
wait how 1984 is the goverment in serbia
ive heard its horrible in poland
GG
wait why are serbian name pronounciation SO WEIRD
they make no sense
LMAO "COLORED REVOLUTION" MENTIONED
AHAHHAHA ITS REAL
@ZeldaLord what
is this serbian humor
wait so john = jovan?
Dragan Jovanovic
john ovic
what does ovic mean
how do u even say it
does the j sound like a j or y
because i heard serbian names in the vids and am SO confused
pronounced the same as youd write them = how its in english
i HATE phoneme bullshit
Jovan (Serbian Cyrillic: Јован Church Slavonic: Їωан) is a Serbian male given name equivalent to English "John"
WAIT I WAS RIGHT
LOL
phonemes genuinely hurt my brain
ok how would that sound
just use english wording for it
whatd be the diff
ALSO
wait why cards plural
why more than one
wait holy fucking shit zeldalord
i just realized interest loans or whatever exist
i get my money passively from weekly allowance
so i dont even need to save up for november
i can literally just buy it like that
is tha
serbian exclusive
ghost
Petar Petrovic
nice doxx
wait
**Dina**Card
thats a fucking aot reference
what the fuck is that
this one is aura
why was vucic in a frige
@ZeldaLord i need lore
wait hmmmmm
what came before
saying shit how its written or however the fuck english does it
actually now that i think about it serbian would be easy to learn since its pronounced how its written
i only think english is easy because its the language i grew up with
looks cool
SAME SHIT
@ZeldaLord ?
"**peak** goverment targets" p3r reference
INFINITE?
THATS A INFINITE REND REFERENCE
i dont get how someone who looks so horrible can be so narcissistic
actual chud png brought to life
i dont like fried chicken that much
it can be good with the right seasoning tho
unironically goes hard with fries
@ZeldaLord have u ever tried making fries its actually good unlike the fast food slop
ok still if you like them
the ones you actually have control over making taste so much better
i js use some spice from the local grocery store on fries
and it makes it taste so fucking good
still ongoing
actual cartoon villain
i watched the one from 3d ago first
because im stupid
yea ik
i realized when i saw the other one is 10d ago
i looked them up before u sent them
ark will save me once again...
wow you can tell how huge the mod is when my game freezes the moment i click on host server
actually its probably gonna crash any second now
its only until i get unbanned
oh we are SO fucking back
this mod is so utterly bullshit im gonna have so much fun with this
i love this slop
everything is level 900 and on crack cocaine
I GOT FOLDED BY THE EVIL CRABS
what the fuck?
actual acid trip
@ZeldaLord
@Pixel
@Carrot
theyre massacring more kuudra players
kuudra holocaust rn
the end is upon us zeldalord
LOL THEY ADDED ELEPHANTS TO ARK THATS SO SILLY
the end of kuudra
FIRST TIME I SAW A UNICORN IN ARK

they shouldve warned
literally EVERYONE wouldve stopped
fuck off mr moral high ground
btw
after the french twink got banned
i literally WARNED these people
that theyre gonna become way more serious and start banning
game sucks
admins suck
community sucks the most
thank god i have ark
i dont mean the banning shit
i mean the complete lack of communication and dogshit updates
niggas think theyre silksong with foraging
dont defend the worst dev team in existence
have you seen how buggy and sloppy the game is

(for p5)
(the p3 3d models are genuinely insane)

no p5 actually sucks
p4 was nostalgic and the artstyle like in ultrakill was still good despite being low poly
p5 is just ass tho

@Pixel can we honestly e date? you’re so beautiful. You always make me laugh, you always make me smile. You literally make me want to become a better person... I really enjoy every moment we spend together. My time has no value unless its spent with you. I tell everyone of my irls how awesome you are. Thank you for being you. Whenever you need someone to be there for you, know that i’ll always be right there by your side. I love you so much. I don’t think you ever realize how amazing you are sometimes. Life isn’t as fun when you’re not around. You are truly stunning. I want you to be my soulmate. I love the way you smile, your eyes are absolutely gorgeous. If I had a star for everytime you crossed my mind i could make the entire galaxy. Your personality is as pretty as you are and thats saying something. I love you, please date me. I am not even calling it e dating anymore because I know we will meet soon enough heart OK I ADMIT IT I LOVE YOU OK i fucking love you and it breaks my heart when i see you play with someone else or anyone commenting in your profile i just want to be your boyfriend and put a heart in my profile linking to your profile and have a walltext of you commenting cute things i want to play video games talk in discord all night andw atch a movie together but you just seem so uninsterested in me it fucking kills me and i cant take it anymore i want to remove you but i care too much about you so please i’m begging you to eaither love me back or remove me and never contact me again it hurts so much to say this because i need you by my side but if you dont love me then i want you to leave because seeing your icon in my friendlist would kill me everyday of my pathetic life.

ULTRAKILL / BRUTAL MAYO% / 1-E: LIMBO ENCORE
Fun fact: I managed to get this done on my second attempt, but OBS for whatever reason gave me massive frame drops during the last fight rendering it impossible to watch. So I had to re-record the run. Thankfully it only took one hour instead of six this time.

SINCE 2023
it looks more normal
because its a normal sane amount of cheese and bacon
why because it doesnt make you develop diabetes instantly?
that reeks so much
how much is thst
"bait" youre a FATASS
why twice
was once not enough
the picture you posted proves otherwise
the amount of cheese on that was like in those mukbang videos
its true though
actually he might not even be fat
hes either a twink or a bit fat

bye bestie @ZeldaLord
oh dear god
show ig
youre disgusting
even if you have a fast metabolism and arent fat youre straight up disgusting
eight.
have some fucking self control
LMFAOOOOO
isnt an entire box like 6$.
is he that broke.
why is he talking like its a luxury onlynfor special occassions
ok this is genuinely sad wtf
id rather eat like a fatass than eat like pixel
thats so miserable
why half a burger huh
also you do know that not eating enough is as bad as eating too much..
calculate how much calories you need to take in in a day
i bought a food scale recently weighing everything is pex miserablus
yeah thats right
i do 2.9k a day
because im cutting
im not eating it anyway
i need protein
yes id kill myself
i have a croissant every week or so
you literally get used to eating slop
yea
.
food is just protein to build muscle
who cares anyway
is this your build
is it
when will zelda start working out and stop being miseranle
before or after silksong
youre happy with not having a social life?
you can just do it casually (go to the gym 3-5 times a week and eat more food with protein) without being a hypergooner like me and there will be good results still
im just dedicating everything to it
how are ALL the people in your class insufferable
thats just not possible
"tolerate speaking to"
serbian royalty melkian ego
look
as long as it doesnt harm anyone
thats funny as shit
are people not allowed to have fun
just sitting in school for 8h wjth no entertainment
would be so fucking miserable
id kill myself
yes english class is by far the worst weve been isolated from eachother and were being controlled if were on our phones or not
(i have not had a single test that wasnt 100%)
god forbid the guy who knows english best doesnt listen to kindergarten level of english
oh youre just antisocial not an evil nigger who conspires against people
idm people who are just there and dont interfere with the shit we do
i remember doing a history exam almost entirely off google searches and checking with my friend who was next to me
literally coop history test
LMFAO HOW RETARDED
also how are you slow at copying
on tests i write so fucking fast that its basically unreadable
but thats fine my writing is unreadable anyway
idc makoto reference..
andrej stop neglecting your school sls
is the only sl youve ranked up hermit (pj)
also do you have any friends from outside school
this is WHAT
pixel did WHAT
at a point it isnt funny anymore just sad
to piss you off
i had no idea pixel actually said shit like that
and considering its dms it probably isnt even bait ...
whyd you never answer
why
i get bored as fuck when alone
i will never understand introverts
i dont know how gooning to gtnh is more fun than doing retarded shit with friends
what do you consider as "fun" even
what do you consider fun irl
@ZeldaLord
walking around like a retard doesnt seem the most fun honestl
how is that fun
its boring
(if you do it EVERY DAY)
is the only thing you find fun gooning to ds2
im god
@Carrot why was urs 2 28
@ZeldaLord zeldaaaa when are you getting better at this game
LMFAO

@Pixel humanity was a mistake
far too big of a mistake
u hate humans no
but is it even for the same reason
or is it because ur antisocial and depressed
personally
people in general are fine
people online however i have not met a single sane trustable person
everyone can rot in hell
ghost
i was tabbed out gooning to my clover on an api site

oh no i ragebait
go ahead zeldalord, go ruin 7k hours of work of me and someone else whos not even related to the ragebaiting because youre pissed at only me

youll never be able to forget those atrocities
Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.
The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.
The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.
fr??
when i try to speculate about ark lore i help myself with rain world lore and oneshot lore
does this resemble anything from rainworld
???/
pixel SHUT UP
the WHAT
no
p5 is 70 dollars
STOP GROOMING ME
the block button
and herest the yapper
ill turn off f adds dw

MAGNUS???
awwww ty
did u see the fanmade kotone opening
its peak
"money cant buy happiness" mfs when they learn of male prostitutes in an adachi cosplay:
idfk what taht is
was sae adachis sugar mommy?
thats where the faggot lives
architecthor
zelda would crashout but
thats literally what i would do
especially the "WHAT IS THIS??"
doesnt this look FIRE
he overdosed on element (an alien material with insane properties) to ascend but instead of becoming one of the evolved ascended humans who live outside space and probably time too  but instead became trapped in the programming of a failing ark forever stuck as the guardian of it (the boss survivors need to defeat to ascend) putting him in an infinite loop of death forever
help
i tried putting both my official atlus adachi dildos up my ass at the same time and theyre stuck
it feels like my rectum is gonna implode
you hate ark right?
lets try this to see if ark is peak or slop

TAMING???
ALSO ANY DINOSAURS??
ANY RIDEABLE SHIT??
GRINDING LEVELS?
RNG IN CREATURE LEVELS?
ok bosses
are there bosses you have to grind a ton for
oh its not an arklike
boring
slop
with that lore i wouldve thought its actually good but no
is it at least mainly focus on survival
and purely survival
ark is a fabricated ecosystem
these are the arks
this is where the final boss is
therye called overseers
theyre there on every map
on the current map im playing the survivors somehow destroyed that area and it killed the dome around it and now during days the surface is so hot that its an instakill if you go there
the surface is also full of "reapers"
anything as cool as this in rw?
show me some creative insane rw designs
ive already seen echos and their designs are insanely good
what the fuck
ii mean
according to my theory which is probably true
earth SEVERELY fucked up and humans went extinct
then weird ais took dna of humans from all time periods and put them on these space stations to survive and adapt and at some point get sent to back to earth to rescue it from idfk what
same for the evolved humans imp retty sure
thats not official name official name is prob better
all the ark lore i yap up is schizo theories
(i dont spoil myself on peak)
do you wanna know what i get whats at this point probably 100 hours of schizophrenia theorycrafting from?
Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.
The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.
The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.
Cause and effect is the way of the universe. Everything must start somewhere. In the case of the System, this is where it was born. You will fall right into its cradle.
Together, the sanctuaries and the Obelisks that power them are the ancestor of every island that floats in the sky. They can all can trace their origins back to this single prototype. Though it is flightless, the core principles and technology behind it are the same.
In a way, that makes it your ancestor too. You were all born within the System, after all. Even if your design is somewhat altered, in a way, you're all its children.
One could say that when you fall, it will be something of a homecoming. In more ways than one.
these 2 things
thats all
this is by what i presume to be the evolved human version of the main character (not the playable character the dossiers writer)
ark has the same thing
via explorer notes
one of the evolved humans has explorer notes on the first 2 maps so definitely on the third one too
and their shit all points to the 4th and most important map extinction
one of the notes on map 2 was for aberration the third map tho
system born = earth
fall = go from the arks in space to earth
sanctuaries = the city and the 2 prototype hot and cold arks
ancestors = as i said prototype arks 
flightless = very early stages of the arks shit as the island extinction note says so theyre on the ground as domes 
your ancestor = humanity extinct as evident by the hologram model of earth being completely fucked
born within the system = humanity extinct and its just dna of random people across earth from all timeframes being uploaded to whatever the fuck the system is 
design altered = survivors are literally DATA that can be uploaded and the implants presumably have it all stored but theyre still humans and have human dna
when you fall = sent to extinction aka earth 
homecoming more ways than one = both humans SOMEHOW repopulating a destroyed earth (the main thing i havent figured out yet) and the system is presumably hosted on earth so both the humanity and the ark tech fuckery return to earth and the prototype arks
if there was a physical copy of ark
actually it probably exists
i would fuck it
i wanna nut on this
tell zelda this is his favorite place
show me a band luh nigga
@Pixel im crying for peak fiction
ITS HATCHING PIXEL ITS HATCHING
holy shit
the sound of the acs in ark block it out in the medal clip but
the fucking music sync was insane with the rock drake hatching
floch
rock drake yippie :DDDD - Clipped with Medal.tv
Watch rock drake yippie :DDDD and millions of other ARK: Survival Evolved videos on Medal, the largest Game Clip Platform.
im quitting again
would rather play hk
oh thats not my main one
the main one was invisible because ark is ark
i had a fucking mental breakdown and five stages of grief because of an invisibility bug
@Pixel
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
MY RNG IS SO INSANE
DADDY IS HERE
ark lore got real dark just now
"persona"
what the fuck???
no??
no zelda
???
edit this into sukuna
zelda WILL kill himself
ok
what is that name
hes like 40 so its fine
but someone thats 16-18 (zelda) wearing that to class would just be self humiliation
fine outfit for going out in the city tho
beards really age up people huh
i have sex with hitler and sex with hitler 2 on my other steam
friend gifted me a while ago
never touched them
do you think silver has a robotic 28 inch strapon
her ass is NOT aigis
wrong person
whatas the setting of rw
is it like a planet or wha
how long have the iterators and ancients and echos been arou7nd for
how much am i missing from only buying rw not downpour
i dont buy shit if there isnt a discount
this is pretty attractive
only 30% tho
also whats the new dlc after downpour gonna be about
i just checked you
dont evne have rw in ur libary
how did he of all people get it
i wanna see the pt
only 131h???
not even all achiv??
ark all achivs makes zeor sense and its only on first map
you can choose to ascend on gamma, beta or alpha and alpha is the hardest one
and theres achievements for each ascension
but if you do alpha you dont get the achievements for gamma and beta.
(the only difference is gamma gives 5 levels, beta 10 levels and alpha 15 levels)
also this that nobody does
and this requires you to beat every map and grind for hundreds of hours after
its stupid.
any spoilers or dcan i watch
how hard is the gameplay btw
of rw
is it scorched earth level (dying 45 times in the first 10 minutes and over 200 times in first few hours)
do you keep inventory and shit
after death
oh ok great no loss
btw
can u savescum.
WHAT
anyway i assume
rw is like surface runs
u do shit, explore then need to get the fuck underground or under cover before you get burned alive
wym
can you technically pirate it
great
can i use pirated downpour with steam rw
so i went on reddit
to read about rw lore specifically ascension and void fluid
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE
explain everything about void worms thanks
i cant understand how they live in the literal void sea
what are they truly
how could something live in the void and live off the void tho
are they fully biological or what
how is it possible
that void worms dont dissolve
oh that makes sense
when the void worm pulls u in its probably to the very bottom
and no matter how deep it looks until that point
the void worms are prob at the surface level still
those are other slugcats ascending no?
or perceived as
why can you eat neurons of an iterator
arent both 5p and lttm malfunctioning
where is she then
GG
the oen that hasnt released?
calls himself the lore expert 💀
huh
oh
whyd u say it is released then
are you stupid?
what is it then
is this alr released
whats it called
explain
wym
oh is that its name
my favorite ark writer
isnt it non canon
????????????????????????
which ending is the best
what
dont you ascend in most
whats outer expanse
whats scavenger king
which campaign for first playthrough
how does a slugcat turn into that
why do most slugcats not try to ascend
oh
can all of them ascend
do any become echos
or can only ancients become echos
oh
why btw
why does saint become an echo then
hwat
why
and how
how can a slugcat ascend others
huh what the fuck happens after that
why acn he
btw what happened to the ancients who didnt ascend
did they just leave earth or
how did they all ascend tho
wouldnt there be way more echos if they all ascended
or is there just a ton of echos in the world that u cant access
why were iterators not able to ascend btw
like why didnt ancients design them so they could ascend after they all left
ye ik
but the structures are massive
can u visit the cities on top of the superstructures
whats in the city
is "james primate" a black man
aw
whats a scavenger btw
in lore
WHAT
why
why
fair enough
how acn you fuck up your reputatio ntho
how do u get rep
they seem useufl
also does everything reset after a cycle
why not
how long in a cycle before it starts raining
is there n ocap
can ite ven start like 10 mins in
and how long do u have toe scape
so u have only 13 mins to explore around??
how common are shelters
oh ok
why btw
do you kill him w that
also wouldnt cycles completely stop happening
if 5p and lttm die
yea but isnt it mainly 5p's issue
for the water usage
?
didnt he use the most
by far
to kil lhimself
what
no
im sane
i dont play persona
or listen to persona
also
do i play rw or er first
once i finish this ark map its effectively over for my ark career
the next 2 and last maps arent designed to be beaten solo
so i cant
play ark anymore
is it a short game
if u do only one or two campaigns
well for er i plan to play it like ark
100% all endings all achivs a ton of grinding
are there any sloppy ones
ark has some sloppy maps
whats the chronological order
why did your retarded brother add me
isnt survivor the first one in rw huh
spearmaster is the one with the discord gc logs right
@Pixel
oh that will be a great first one then
how long to finish every campaign
i am not doing the dating sim one btw
wym
oh that one
achiv?
useless then
how long to do every campaign in hours aproximately
why 80 for the first wtf
im not that bad at videogames
i beat scorched a really hard map very fast

whos top 1
.
im just curious about how degen you too are
lmao
hey pixel yk that atrocious memories of ark edit i made after finishing p3r
few days after i started playing the slop again
what a horrible fucking decision!
how finished is p3r kotone mod i need p3r content
when i finish portal 2 what should i play
geno ut?
what exactly do i have to kill for it
all unique monsters and all bosses?
@Pixel is there a mouse or at least wasd undertale mod
undyne doesnt look IMPOSSIBLY hard ill be fine with a few hours or days
the yellow arrows are concerning tho
kinda boring tho
oh do i do that after pacifist
ill just rs and do pacifist
ur a gooner 💀
mementos isnt in p3
and does she use it on yukari or makoto
if were being realistic here mitsuru would make an ice dildo and use it on you
wym
that sentence makes zero sense
also ben is the nazi not me
im german not austrian
pixel when archipelago
is your cuck boyfriend still gooning to towny
i wanna play ocarina of time
zeldqa
@Pixel do you find this cute
whats that a reference to
what
pixel its a robot
kill yourself
ur black lolll
memories of utter slop
ghost msg
im going to rape you, pixel
so will be your cheeks
wait what the fuck is your display name nigger
LMFAOOO
us :3
NEAND JUST DMD ME
KYS
@Pixel
oh yea what do those words mean even
heat supressants alpha omega
@Pixel he didnt explain shit
you explain
that doesnt mean anything
oh i looked it up
its mpreg gay fanfiction.
i never wanted to grab a knife i swear
i want you to wear a femboy mitsuru cosplay and sit on my face
did you know maruki was freaky like that?
i go on okbp like once a month when im reminded it exists by you
and god are there some BANGERS
its weird how theres actually good palace shadow designs (maruki) and utter slop palace shadow designs (kamoshida, madarame, kaneshiro)
should i actually finish it after portal 2 and genocide route
i think i need a long long break from ark
do you know why i enjoyed utter slop when i got back into it november? because i havent played it for 2.5 months and missed it
maybe i can actually sorta like the final 2 slop dlcs if i dont play ark for 4+ months beforehand
aberration is peak video game and everything else fucking sucks
actually hm debateable
p3r had a good ending aberration got a bit boring towards the end and the bossfight was a buggy mess the final cinematic was insane tho
even if p3r is better its still up there
is it better than p3 ending
idk if ill ever play a better game than p3
which characters ending
when i finished p3r i immediately went to sleep so i wouldnt cry
it worked but i still woke up depressed
it was like 4 am too lol
oh i watched the base game ascension already its like an acid trip
i also watched a 1h 30 video essay on rw once
how long without sleep
only 12h?
long periods without sleep fuck up your brain
i thought a small shark at an austrian terrarium house thingy was the weirdest shit known to man when i was on 30h+ no sleep
which is the best ending in rw
which route
and should i do my first playthrough without rw
theyre all good??????????????????????
impossible
ark: releases 4 slop maps, releases peak fiction, releases 7 more slop maps
good as in good writing or good outcome
i know saint becomes an echo
and artificer becomes an echo
unfun?
greed.....
PIXEL WHAT THE FUCK????????????????????????????????????????????????
RW STEAM KEYS ARE 4$

what makes it unique
the character u sent whos that
kys
stupid?
also are you adding a good villai
honestly i like it most when a villain isnt some cartoonishly evil or tragic backstory but just someone with not inherently bad actions that are opposite to the protagonist's
yes i know the term is antagonist not villain but smd
oh are you making that type of villain
like mahito and barem
where you just utterly fucking DESPISE
make him more hateable than barem
@Pixel i know how much you hate ark
BUT WHY THE FUCK IS IT SPRAYING MILS OUT OF TITS FROM THE SIDE OF ITS BODY
its just an INSANELY weird ark creature
one of the devs got their fetish made into a creature i guess?
how big plot twist are we talking
are you doing that lmao
at least make them appear more throughout the story
kinda like flowey does
whats his name
whats the setting of the game
PIXELATED
FACE
I REJOINED KUUDRA GANG
AND A STAFF GUY HAS THIS IN STATUS
IT ARE SO OVER
idk what it is
OK SO HEAR ME OUT
UNDERTALE START IS AN AOT REFERENCE
ILL EXPLAIN IT ALL WHEN YOU WAKE UP
is that even a woman pixel
will
@Pixel
how do u notice the least significant thing first
wait u should put smt like that in ur game
wonder of u
what else retard
wtf u mean 7 souls
yea undertale sub but didnt know what it meant
anyway undertale is attack on titan 1:1
- chara/frisk/whatever the fuck is the real name falls into the tree which is an entire new world and power presumably because other humans were not the nicest to them
- commits genocide by infleuncing/manipulating another abused human
huhhh
who the fuck is frisk then
ohhhh
so chara uses frisk as a vessel to genocide
by influencing frisk
actual aot reference....
yea yea same in aot its the mcs decision to genocide the long dead morally grey child with insane powers only helps
asriel is flowey right
chara killed themselves with those flowers intentionally right
~~elden ring miquella reference~~
did you ever beat sans, pixel?
how many people even have
the final attack
is geometry dash
i could never get past the final attack
why would you not
new content!
should i play uty when i finish geno in 55 years

wym
no pixel you saw it
its just the same image
that i used for faking looking at shuake r34
if youre that curious

thats a male child not an adult bird woman
👎👎👎👎👎
hey pixel yk that bird balls gif
is there any birds with huge balls in uty
pixel lets esex in kuudra gang im bored
why not
what point
oh yea i read that
ut has 93 endings.
which are actually relevant and in what order
im gonna redo the entire game soon
ye ik but thats still MENTAL
how much of a diff is soullest pacifist an 2nd geno
should i stop watching ark videos and watch the 3h all ut endings video
I HAVE CANCER
107 osts
how much effort went into uty.
how long did base ut take
how many endings
wtf would flawed pacifist be
oh is it mostly new charcaters
how many returning characters
which
when is it set
does chara never appear
whos main villain
oh does he take your soul
in all ending?
so you spare everyone to kill yourself
show
also isnt flowey asriel
WTF IS THAT
wait has anyone done geno no hit
ut
is she geno final boss
can you not spare JUST her
WHYYY
LMAO

but akechi secretly enjoys it
wait i jus realized
mitsuru is not a dommy mommy at all
in her sl she isnt dominant in the slightest

i wanted her to be a dommy mommy who pegs jonkler for bad grades and shit
NAHHHHH
THIS IS JUST EVIL
japan has emo twink strip clubs?????

@Pixel @Pixel @Pixel @Pixel

no
youre an actual gooner
NVM I WANT IT NOW
SEND ME
send
WHY NOT
ITS PORN???
why are we watching porn mr pixelated face
DIE
with who
are you
in drone posting yet
can u do a eldritch design for it
pleas
na
what
no
so is he miserablus about it
PLEASE dont make it a goth twink but an actual eldritch monster
i hate when designs of cool concepts get reduced to tumblr twinks
"god of death and damnation" and his design is this
ok hear me out on this one
make it A FUCKTON of arms
and make the arms and then his head be this cross shape all together
and kinda hunched back with the coffin strapped to his back
also incorporate elements of white not just black
make his skin pure white
and dont make his head some emo shti make it some eldritch shit
youre so unoriginal
go for an uncanny valley feel
like 3-4m tall and his limbs humanoid but weirder
make some of his arms 4 or 6 fingers
make them long and slender but still thicker than the average person's
and make his head a complete anomaly maybe something thatd be like a cross
basically like fiends in csm
where they have some shit bashed into their head
do this melded thing into human head thing
but make it a white or black cross
and itd go through the head and end with the chin
where itd go down from would be like a bullet wound from behind in the head
huh
wait this would be
so good
because you could have the hair go upwards like hair would be if youre laying down in a coffin from the back
like where the coffin is
are you going for a general vibe of him being dead
wait i just realized.
this is a pixelated game
most of the shit i mentione
would only work with a high res most likely 3d design
ok you could go with this
vibe of life on him but vibe of death on his outfit
@Pixel what kind of personality are you going for for him btw?
i have an idea but explain the personality first
is he good or bad
does he wish for death
yea thats what i meant
you could go for the rarely seen approach of death
where its just someone guiding the dead towards their end
and also if you have any characters dying
make foreshadowing with him
make interesting interactions
where he doesnt explicitly say it
but it subtly shows in his sprites and dialogue that someone is near their end
oh boring i had this entire idea
make it someone whos just compassionate and kind and wants to guide souls to a (probably) walmart rw ascension without confusion so they safely reach their destination
an interesting trait would be an interaction with someone not ready to die yet and despite him probably seeing a case like that many times still feeling bad about it
@Pixel PLEASE make a sea of souls
that could be so good in a 2d pixel game
and a sick ass pale canoe
and he just talks to the person about to die there
you could also make the cemetery and sea of souls have an interesting trait
where its just a black white gray color scheme
itd add to the atmosphere at least in the guiding to death scenes
whos that character you showed btw
mc?
whats the setting of the game
oh yea how are you gonna get music for the game
music in games like os and ut is so important to the atmosphere
@Pixel whats his main facial expression gonna be
like in his character model and sprites
HEAR ME OUT YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS ITS SUCH A COOL POSE
like make his character model when guiding the souls have some kind of lantern like that
and itd be a white light
true
it could be just a gray sprite of the mc
but how do you give it this translucent sorta vibe
like its fading
you should put that all over the sea of souls
and itd be just this small circle of white light where its kind of visible
from the lantern
anyways this but hes extending his arm out of the boat
kinda like this but shorter arm obv
and the trench coat would look very good with that
ok what about a gray river
that leads to it
and then its like a waterfall down to it
and thats where he parts way with the soul
and also where you could enter it by interacting with him
what.
is that like
the silksong dev
who then
why would it be silksong related
OH THE CAKE IS A LIE SO SILKSONG IS A LIE
pure lies and bait
true
WHY DO THEY LOOK LIKE CHIHIRO AND FUUKA
no
@Pixel @Pixel @Pixel

NAHHH
KYS!

pixel
did u ever read berserk
u should
itd be funny
u could make so much rot with it pixel
endless possibilities
ENDLESS
when will you
you need to read it
it would change you worse than persona and nso did
zelda would genuinely take his fathers gun if you made berserk pj rot
i used to make berserk rot in 2021
god was it horrible
i tried to get zelda into berserk once
but didnt work
so you need to
look isnt he silly
PIXEL
GREAT SELLING POINT FOR BERSERK
THERES A COMEDIC RELIEF NAKED FAIRY
HES IN LIKE EVERY CHAPTER
THEN WAY LATER ON ALSO A FEMALE ONE
ghost

TOXIC YAOI
sloppiest slop to have ever slopped
can this be us
:3
reaper like
WAIT WHY ARE THE GRAPHICS GOOD?
yea
i thought its like mc always same graphics
the game can acc be good?
ok hear me out
its not always the same coffin
he lets the coffin
go down the waterfall
also another way to humanise him would be making the coffin seem very heavy and make him sorta hunched back to illustrate the weight of his burden of being death
idk about ur butterfly character but
r u just making a 1:1.
pets or native to that area
how about
either glowing butterflies or fireflies
in his lantenr
the lantern can just release any amount it doesnt matter that its small
over both his eyes?
make it actual unique designs if ur giving him such basic shit
wait u figjt him?
ok sans
wait yk whatd be fire
if the end of the scythe also had a small pointy blade
and thats how he stabs himself
oh wtf
so how do u defeat him is he a secret superboss like elizabeth
from how long
itd be better if he just got bored
so like papyrus?
ok thats fire
@Pixel btw how done are you with the game
whats ur pfp
shut up
whats with you and 15 year olds from persona
fucking pedophile
d
first sumire then naoto
what about when youre 18.

It's Going Down Now, but it's ATTACK ON TITAN STYLE (Persona 3 Reload)
Had a lot of fun with this Persona 3 Reload cover :) Tried to emulate the style of Hiroyuki Sawano in his Attack on Titan soundtrack "Wings OF Freedom". Let me know what you think!
OS...
peak
so many aot haters..
i hope you get uzis solver tail shoved from the ass through the mouth
what was that i couldnt see
no it wasnt
it was the old bitch from p5
post it again
same
hear me out on this one
HEAR
ME
OUT
LOOK PIXEL
fuck i genuinely cant think of anything
to push the agenda
no
ill just turn it from 1h to perma if u ask again
is it copyright if its only the ingame name
oh
youre so rotted
holy fuck
wait reminds me when
i went to venice for a day after p3 depression
and i heard persona on the radio in italy
it means person in italian
how much dyk about metaphor
i saw a post with metaphor screenshots the graphics look so good
i need to finish p5 sometime
also elden ring
how many sprites do u have made
show one for a sec
why
how
like a pattern or smt?
show
why
youve never showed me anything from the gmae
?
is it still like very early draft
that character you sent looked fine
dont you plan on releasing this.
when did you start working on it
was the "makotoifiedflochforster" part of it
when zelda pretended to not know who makoto is
because persona rot didnt breach yet
also wdyt of the song from ep8
u should rewatch then
HUH
the fuck for
i dont let my parents stay in for longer than like 1 min
why even watch it then
ep8 had quite a few scenes
not very appropriate for parents and younger brother
what type of character is it
what color is the outfit
good color but yellow eyes would be literally velvet room
what hair color and other accessories if there are some
@Pixel i was looking up
md lore on reddit
cyn is canonically a child in the manor
explain yourself, pixel
ghost
ghost again
ik not tabbed all the time
sy again
bro u deleted before i csn read
"i said stop"
KYS
thin ice
dont lie now
how can a dress make her emo
kinda looks like alula
i do that sometomes
if its a weekend or on vacation
i have
a wonderful idea
ark pacifist run
since i cant really do the main objective (beating the boss) due to needing to kill it the objective is to get all the artifacts without killing a single creature
i can only get shit like hide and meat from dinos killed by other dinos
i looked up ark on twitter and one of the first results is unspoilered uncensored resident evil porn.
im deleting this fucking app.
so some niche thing or actually viable
LMAO DO IT
endure is only once no
make it the amount of damage youre originally gonna get hit by with defense in the calculation but not the amount damage you receive
so you can use it with endure on some insanely high hp thing
ye thats the thing
make bosses like elizabeth too
make sure defense is calculated into it so if u want to use it ur gonna go for low defense
how r u doing it
and is it gonna be a party like deltarune and persona or
how do u attack
like do u jsut press smt likei n persona
can u get more than one attack
nah just like
3-5 diff attacks
can u miss ur attacks
can it repel
and can attacks be weak to a certain enemy
repel is a very underused mechanic in persona give it more strategic uses
oh yea i beat that minotaur boss in 3rd block by waiting for it to charge its strongest attack then using a phys mirror tr tr tr
i unironically know someone whod do that
do i ask?
what level of egyptianism and greed is not wanting to play elden ring to not reach 2h so i cant refund it anymore
like
i dont even plan on refunding it
im just a greedy fuck
WHAT
ok pixel
those white haired robots
from nier
what do they remind you of?
tr tr tr tr
fucking hell im depressed because i cant get myself to like ark anymore
looking back on it only one map was actually enjoyable and another was only enjoyable in retrospect because of nostalgia and attachment to it
i spent so many hours on slop
island and aberration are the ONLY good maps everything else fucking sucks and is a soulless shitty disgusting sloppy cashgrab and i hate it I HATE THIS GAME
im trying out what people call "the best map in ark" rn AND IT FUCKING SUCKS ITS JUST EVERYTHING CRAMMED ONTO ONE MAP ITS BAD I HATE IT IT SUCKS I FUCKING AHTE IT I FUCKING HATE ARK I FUCKING HATE THIS G AME I FUCKING HATE IT
rw reference

acrually no
i sound way too bad in thst clip
just forget it
horrid HORRID game design
u get thrown into a world where everything kills u with no explanation
only explanation i got was to go to stormveil
terraria isnt bad game design the game is just fucking boring
i was able to progress without looking up shit
i was having a really great time actually but NOOOO  i have to make a hell elevator
and i kept hitting water and lava
do i just gave up on the game
great without that aspect though
NO PIXEL
THE PROBLEM IS GETTING RID OF THE LAVA
NOT DYING TO IT
oh noone told me thst...
ill pick it up again tmr
way better than elden slop
was really looking forward to wall of flesh anyway
i alr got the doll im pretty sure
so i can fight it asap
ive been there pixel
i just didnt have an elevator
i used an impracticsl tunnel that takes like 5 mins to get to hell
from my first caving experience
why?
is it insanely hard or smt
well im on normal so
how long to complete a first playthrough btw
like 80h?
agony
what.
WHAT
look
i was hoping for zelda to gift me before someone spotted a contradiction
dont blame me

who did you give the idea to
dont you think
its enough to have a fake transmasc pronouns page of me (idk who made it) and super writing porn fanfiction of me already
@FlochForster • Pronouns.page
Usage examples of personal pronouns and gender neutral language.
alreqdy asked zelda and its fake
this could be us but NOOOOO youre still closeted
whyyy
lets be cute depressed suicidal lesbian robot girls
lets have a double suicide <3
lets just do hot depressed robot lesbian shit together then

twitter REALLY REALLY wants me to follow elon musk for some reason
excuse me
EXCUSE ME??
are you depressed yet
lets get matching sh scars and show them to each other
i follow only the jjk leaker
same
but like years ago
omori is way too edgy
also what happened to timeout, pixel?
in your head or
why would you schizo up so many different things before finishing one of them?
show the mc
of the current game youre making
also wtf is the name
ok so ill take it like this
the name is stupid and temporary or theres no name
first letter?
is the name dex
agony
lets just say
adachi has a sexual awakening in store for me in august
zeldas young teacher with the persona moon sticker
is ms toriumi in the zeldalordic persona universe
and they will bond over and have a social link when zelda opens okbp in pc class
??????????????????????????????
you could manipulate me into hurting myself
isnt that hot
you fear the contents of my pc
if zelda is 18 then
you can make
the idea you wanted to make
so long ago
ok so
what that word meant
the term cuny
means
the uh
of a loli
ok all ill say is that he unironically jerks off
to
well
we need to
find super
and kill him
shoot him to death
super roblox profile
someone needs to shoot him
do you ever just get hit with a huge realization at 3am

is that cactabyte
wait why was ur ign pixelatedface
what happened to that account
how much did u pay for it
i used to buy alts for like 2$ and i still have access to a lot of them
how long did it last
why was it ign pixelatedface then
who tf owns it
wait so
zelda played on a cracked server
so your egypt ass could play mc
then how did you meet zelda on a server
whyd he be on a cracked server
could mecatt not afford a mc account
let me guess
magnus couldnt afford an account either
what ign did he have
LMAO
does not exist
ohh
cuz when i looked up pixelatedface
someone had that
then why not pick something actually cool
like Pex
or Extinction
or Amogus
oh no i have money noooo
did you get a mc account the moment you saw an orespawn video and thought it looked cool?
thats sad
whats ur average meal
yummy
is your only source of water cactuses
is a scorched earth playthrough your day to day life
it is
do u have a wyvern pixel
do you have a morellatops to conserve water
what about jerboas to alert you of weather
these are mine jerboas
look at the names
you fucking WISH hollow knight was this good
look its smegma gobbler, balls fondler and urethra pincher
WHAT
that looks peak????
its like this area from aberration
wtf
is this aura
ic an see why
how late into the game is it
whats desolate dive
wait cool movement shit exists wtf???
so its ultrakill but 2d??
also is it actually slow as fuck
i told thomas to play ultrakill today and he said hes more used to slower shit like hk
with souls like do you mean ill get ambushed by something i cant actually fight for a while in a place thats said to be safe?
ok but how bullshit is it
will you have a fight against something that takes 30+ hits to kill that can onetap you 4h into the game?
said onetap is a big aoe btw
so like smoke bomb in cuphead
is there any random huge difficulty spikes
theres no unfair shit correct
also no unfair bugs (looking at you ark survival evolved)
is path of pain fun when you learn the mechanics of the game
ultrakill brutal is SO fun when you actually know the mechanics and techs
i love completely skipping 3-2 gabriel's first phase in 2 seconds
so like elizabeth from p3r?
optional but good reward

THIS IS FOR THE NEW DEATH DEVIL IN CSM TODAY

are the ones that said 15h just very very very very very shit at it?
im not streaming it
its completeable today right
i hope oneshot isnt lethal company v2
everyone praises it but i utterly despise it
is it one of those games where community is insane but the base game has no degen shit
i dont wanna see anything like this in the game
made me quit instantly
yea
i hit the dummy becuase i hate ralsei
then he fucking says THAT
you act like i know the lore implications
im yet to buy undertale
thats wasnt something i wanted to know
how does that mean theyre the same person
werent 2 chapters released and nothing after
why are you the 3rd person to tell me that
isnt it a fan game
genocide sounds fun tho
what about normal undertale
same boss or what
oh so do i have to do both
so do pacifist first then genocide?
for which game
ut or uty
are there routes and shit in oneshot
same game or seperate or what
is it included in the 4h of oneshot
so whats total pt
is the game like normal
without weird moments like ralsei
theres no ralsei characters right
i mean oneshot
why does niko look so weird tho
every fucking degen furry has a niko pfp
is niko weird like ralsei or no
credit card didnt work so i buy it tmr morning
im looking for the RhynioGYATha

youll never be able to forget those atrocities
Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.
The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.
The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.
fr??
when i try to speculate about ark lore i help myself with rain world lore and oneshot lore
does this resemble anything from rainworld

pixel SHUT UP
the WHAT
no

u here?
ready to post?
MAGNUS???
awwww ty
did u see the fanmade kotone opening
its peak
"money cant buy happiness" mfs when they learn of male prostitutes in an adachi cosplay:
idfk what taht is
was sae adachis sugar mommy?
thats where the faggot lives
architecthor
zelda would crashout but
thats literally what i would do
especially the "WHAT IS THIS??"
doesnt this look FIRE
he overdosed on element (an alien material with insane properties) to ascend but instead of becoming one of the evolved ascended humans who live outside space and probably time too  but instead became trapped in the programming of a failing ark forever stuck as the guardian of it (the boss survivors need to defeat to ascend) putting him in an infinite loop of death forever
help
i tried putting both my official atlus adachi dildos up my ass at the same time and theyre stuck
it feels like my rectum is gonna implode
you hate ark right?
lets try this to see if ark is peak or slop

ALSO ANY DINOSAURS??
ANY RIDEABLE SHIT??
GRINDING LEVELS?
RNG IN CREATURE LEVELS?
ok bosses
are there bosses you have to grind a ton for
oh its not an arklike
boring
slop
with that lore i wouldve thought its actually good but no
is it at least mainly focus on survival
and purely survival
ark is a fabricated ecosystem
these are the arks
this is where the final boss is
therye called overseers
theyre there on every map
on the current map im playing the survivors somehow destroyed that area and it killed the dome around it and now during days the surface is so hot that its an instakill if you go there
the surface is also full of "reapers"
anything as cool as this in rw?
show me some creative insane rw designs
ive already seen echos and their designs are insanely good
what the fuck
ii mean
according to my theory which is probably true
earth SEVERELY fucked up and humans went extinct
then weird ais took dna of humans from all time periods and put them on these space stations to survive and adapt and at some point get sent to back to earth to rescue it from idfk what
same for the evolved humans imp retty sure
thats not official name official name is prob better
all the ark lore i yap up is schizo theories
(i dont spoil myself on peak)
do you wanna know what i get whats at this point probably 100 hours of schizophrenia theorycrafting from?
Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.
The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.
The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.
Cause and effect is the way of the universe. Everything must start somewhere. In the case of the System, this is where it was born. You will fall right into its cradle.
Together, the sanctuaries and the Obelisks that power them are the ancestor of every island that floats in the sky. They can all can trace their origins back to this single prototype. Though it is flightless, the core principles and technology behind it are the same.
In a way, that makes it your ancestor too. You were all born within the System, after all. Even if your design is somewhat altered, in a way, you're all its children.
One could say that when you fall, it will be something of a homecoming. In more ways than one.
these 2 things
thats all
this is by what i presume to be the evolved human version of the main character (not the playable character the dossiers writer)
ark has the same thing
via explorer notes
one of the evolved humans has explorer notes on the first 2 maps so definitely on the third one too
and their shit all points to the 4th and most important map extinction
one of the notes on map 2 was for aberration the third map tho
system born = earth
fall = go from the arks in space to earth
sanctuaries = the city and the 2 prototype hot and cold arks
ancestors = as i said prototype arks 
flightless = very early stages of the arks shit as the island extinction note says so theyre on the ground as domes 
your ancestor = humanity extinct as evident by the hologram model of earth being completely fucked
born within the system = humanity extinct and its just dna of random people across earth from all timeframes being uploaded to whatever the fuck the system is 
design altered = survivors are literally DATA that can be uploaded and the implants presumably have it all stored but theyre still humans and have human dna
when you fall = sent to extinction aka earth 
homecoming more ways than one = both humans SOMEHOW repopulating a destroyed earth (the main thing i havent figured out yet) and the system is presumably hosted on earth so both the humanity and the ark tech fuckery return to earth and the prototype arks
if there was a physical copy of ark
actually it probably exists
i would fuck it
i wanna nut on this
tell zelda this is his favorite place
show me a band luh nigga
@Pixel im crying for peak fiction
ITS HATCHING PIXEL ITS HATCHING
holy shit
the sound of the acs in ark block it out in the medal clip but
the fucking music sync was insane with the rock drake hatching
floch
rock drake yippie :DDDD - Clipped with Medal.tv
Watch rock drake yippie :DDDD and millions of other ARK: Survival Evolved videos on Medal, the largest Game Clip Platform.
im quitting again
would rather play hk
oh thats not my main one
the main one was invisible because ark is ark
i had a fucking mental breakdown and five stages of grief because of an invisibility bug
@Pixel
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
MY RNG IS SO INSANE
DADDY IS HERE
ark lore got real dark just now
"persona"
what the fuck???
no??
no zelda
???
edit this into sukuna
zelda WILL kill himself
ok
what is that name
hes like 40 so its fine
but someone thats 16-18 (zelda) wearing that to class would just be self humiliation
fine outfit for going out in the city tho
beards really age up people huh
i have sex with hitler and sex with hitler 2 on my other steam
friend gifted me a while ago
never touched them
do you think silver has a robotic 28 inch strapon
her ass is NOT aigis
wrong person
whatas the setting of rw
is it like a planet or wha
how long have the iterators and ancients and echos been arou7nd for
how much am i missing from only buying rw not downpour
i dont buy shit if there isnt a discount
this is pretty attractive
only 30% tho
also whats the new dlc after downpour gonna be about
i just checked you
dont evne have rw in ur libary
how did he of all people get it
i wanna see the pt
only 131h???
not even all achiv??
ark all achivs makes zeor sense and its only on first map
you can choose to ascend on gamma, beta or alpha and alpha is the hardest one
and theres achievements for each ascension
but if you do alpha you dont get the achievements for gamma and beta.
(the only difference is gamma gives 5 levels, beta 10 levels and alpha 15 levels)
also this that nobody does
and this requires you to beat every map and grind for hundreds of hours after
its stupid.
any spoilers or dcan i watch
how hard is the gameplay btw
of rw
is it scorched earth level (dying 45 times in the first 10 minutes and over 200 times in first few hours)
do you keep inventory and shit
after death
oh ok great no loss
btw
can u savescum.
WHAT
anyway i assume
rw is like surface runs
u do shit, explore then need to get the fuck underground or under cover before you get burned alive
wym
can you technically pirate it
great
can i use pirated downpour with steam rw
so i went on reddit
to read about rw lore specifically ascension and void fluid
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE
explain everything about void worms thanks
i cant understand how they live in the literal void sea
what are they truly
how could something live in the void and live off the void tho
are they fully biological or what
how is it possible
that void worms dont dissolve
oh that makes sense
when the void worm pulls u in its probably to the very bottom
and no matter how deep it looks until that point
the void worms are prob at the surface level still
those are other slugcats ascending no?
or perceived as
why can you eat neurons of an iterator
arent both 5p and lttm malfunctioning
where is she then
GG
the oen that hasnt released?
calls himself the lore expert 💀
huh
oh
whyd u say it is released then
are you stupid?
what is it then
is this alr released
whats it called
explain
wym
oh is that its name
my favorite ark writer
isnt it non canon
????????????????????????
which ending is the best
what
dont you ascend in most
whats outer expanse
whats scavenger king
which campaign for first playthrough
how does a slugcat turn into that
why do most slugcats not try to ascend
oh
can all of them ascend
do any become echos
or can only ancients become echos
oh
why btw
why does saint become an echo then
hwat
why
and how
how can a slugcat ascend others
huh what the fuck happens after that
why acn he
btw what happened to the ancients who didnt ascend
did they just leave earth or
how did they all ascend tho
wouldnt there be way more echos if they all ascended
or is there just a ton of echos in the world that u cant access
why were iterators not able to ascend btw
like why didnt ancients design them so they could ascend after they all left
ye ik
but the structures are massive
can u visit the cities on top of the superstructures
whats in the city
is "james primate" a black man
aw
whats a scavenger btw
in lore
WHAT
why
why
fair enough
how acn you fuck up your reputatio ntho
how do u get rep
they seem useufl
also does everything reset after a cycle
why not
how long in a cycle before it starts raining
is there n ocap
can ite ven start like 10 mins in
and how long do u have toe scape
so u have only 13 mins to explore around??
how common are shelters
oh ok
why btw
do you kill him w that
also wouldnt cycles completely stop happening
if 5p and lttm die
yea but isnt it mainly 5p's issue
for the water usage
?
didnt he use the most
by far
to kil lhimself
what
no
im sane
i dont play persona
or listen to persona
also
do i play rw or er first
once i finish this ark map its effectively over for my ark career
the next 2 and last maps arent designed to be beaten solo
so i cant
play ark anymore
is it a short game
if u do only one or two campaigns
well for er i plan to play it like ark
100% all endings all achivs a ton of grinding
are there any sloppy ones
ark has some sloppy maps
whats the chronological order
why did your retarded brother add me
isnt survivor the first one in rw huh
spearmaster is the one with the discord gc logs right
@Pixel
oh that will be a great first one then
how long to finish every campaign
i am not doing the dating sim one btw
wym
oh that one
achiv?
useless then
how long to do every campaign in hours aproximately
why 80 for the first wtf
im not that bad at videogames
i beat scorched a really hard map very fast
KYS IM IN PUBLCI

how tall is magnus btw
stop attention seeking youre not redacted from my school
do you vape by any chance
oh ok
ur not that retarded
.
is he actually short asl
anyway how do you feel about being the same height as the most retarded and degenerate person i know
how tall is zelda
need to know to assign which persona mc he is
yu is the tallest then joker is in the middle and makoto is shorter than you
youve made
edits of yu and makoto zelda
make a waffle phantom thieves mask with the blond hair joker edit
it would be funny.
ive taken a liking to the rot as of recently
what tools do you usually use to make your edits?
i use ms paint rn
how do i photoshop btw
and make the waffle pattenrs
well ypu could just
do my commission
of joker zelda
in the cimments
of that ren x akechi post
"sumire is taking the picture from the cuck chair"
LMAOOOOOO
bro what no
i was tryna think and
theres genuinely no hot persona characters
no
WHATS WITH YOU AND MITSURU
chidori is an emo bitch id rather fuck a guy than an emo bitch
LMAO IN THE COMMENTS
IN MARUKI IDEALR EALITY MPREG IS REAL
WHAT IF THAT WAS AKECHIS WISH

idk u ever saw and u shpuldnt
so like that post about ann and makoto?
he made him wear a fake pussy in schizoland that becomes a real pussy in schizoland?

also react to bait in pj
WHAT
proof?
WHAT THE FUCK SI THAT FROM???
dw i do
i goon to gallica HOURLY
considering the oneshot channel
im concerned
no the normal onesho channel
u could technically use the same technology for gallica gooning
lets make a gallica r34 subreddit
with zelda
NO
considering what you do
and how you asked about how old the person in the thigh picture is and when i said 18 you wanted me to send it
idfk tho
just look it up on the wiki
spoiler alert its not a woman
stop gooning now
on a thread about how well hidden the it's weapons are
no.
ark porn exists
ask architecthor if you dont believe me
i ave images off
is that genuinely fucking md porn
if you repeteadly fucked fem 5p
would it be enough water to power
look at those curves pixel
its canon no?
the curves...
is this the worst day in pj
besides when the fanfic thing happened
because holy fuck
zelda is gonna kill himself after this
its funny asl
make another schizopost edit
to even further contribute
this is unironically like when the teacher leaves the classroom
instead its gooning to fictional machines
why are you saying this in dms
this is not pj
there is noone to bait
go say it in pj
pussy
under the ribbon
wait since you said joker has 2 cocks
if he was straight
could he fuck aigis' "pussy" and mouth at the same time
make thsi with zelda and make the tears maple syrup
please
its bait right
right
post it in announcements then
THIS IS PEAK
HOLY FUCK
is this even better
just do this the tears can be maple syrup
LMFAO
wait make it
an emoji/sticker
just name it 12/31/24
im originally from us
just make it 31/12/24 idgaf
does it help that im from ohio
unironically

the emoji
start it
and use the emoji after
well nwo he has 2 ghostpings in there
go in like
some obscure thing
edit his face into zeldas
and hands
and make this symbol pj
just face and hands thnen
just put the pfps on their faces in a bad edit
mid workout then i go out
zelda has like 15 min to appear before i gtg
where is the FUCKING WAFFLE
do you have his snap or phone number or anything
LMFAO THE "i dont care"
because straight sex doesnt exist in the persona universe retard
btw i remembered aigis has that metis shadow
you can fuck aigis' neckhole ill fuck metis'
cyborg babies

@Pixel LMFAO SOMEONE EDITED MAKOTO AND ANN INTO LADY AND TRISH

oh im stupid
when i jerk off to adachi my cumshots reach the roof
ok kill yourself
WHY IS THERE AN ADACHI DOG LMAO
BY MY HAND
AND WITH HAND I MEAN COCK
AHAHAH
the joke is thwt someone actually drew that
zelda will kill himself
unironically my drawing is worse than tbat
which is

@Pixel dyt the neckhole is grippy btw
is it like a fleshlight

ZELDA KILLS HIMSELF LMAOOOO
THAT WILL BE PEAK COMEDY
your self insert mc then?
WHAT
look i like writing characters too but self inserts are just fucking boring
youre writing a character not giving yourself a power fantasy and making yourself righteous
oh i get what u mean
ur playing into the part that its actually real like oneshot?
interesting approach thats rare to see in games
no
do not
its more of
the fact its you only have one shot at fixing things
its called one shot not first shot
what is it then if not that
huhhh
LMFAOOOOOO
rot

whos top 1
.
im just curious about how degen you too are
lmao
hey pixel yk that atrocious memories of ark edit i made after finishing p3r
few days after i started playing the slop again
what a horrible fucking decision!
how finished is p3r kotone mod i need p3r content
when i finish portal 2 what should i play
geno ut?
what exactly do i have to kill for it
all unique monsters and all bosses?
@Pixel is there a mouse or at least wasd undertale mod
undyne doesnt look IMPOSSIBLY hard ill be fine with a few hours or days
the yellow arrows are concerning tho
kinda boring tho
oh do i do that after pacifist
ill just rs and do pacifist
ur a gooner 💀
mementos isnt in p3
and does she use it on yukari or makoto
if were being realistic here mitsuru would make an ice dildo and use it on you
wym
that sentence makes zero sense
also ben is the nazi not me
im german not austrian
pixel when archipelago
is your cuck boyfriend still gooning to towny
i wanna play ocarina of time
zeldqa
@Pixel do you find this cute
whats that a reference to
what
pixel its a robot
kill yourself
ur black lolll
memories of utter slop
ghost msg
im going to rape you, pixel
so will be your cheeks
wait what the fuck is your display name nigger
LMFAOOO
us :3
NEAND JUST DMD ME
KYS
@Pixel
oh yea what do those words mean even
heat supressants alpha omega
@Pixel he didnt explain shit
you explain
that doesnt mean anything
oh i looked it up
its mpreg gay fanfiction.
i never wanted to grab a knife i swear
i want you to wear a femboy mitsuru cosplay and sit on my face
did you know maruki was freaky like that?
i go on okbp like once a month when im reminded it exists by you
and god are there some BANGERS
its weird how theres actually good palace shadow designs (maruki) and utter slop palace shadow designs (kamoshida, madarame, kaneshiro)
should i actually finish it after portal 2 and genocide route
i think i need a long long break from ark
do you know why i enjoyed utter slop when i got back into it november? because i havent played it for 2.5 months and missed it
maybe i can actually sorta like the final 2 slop dlcs if i dont play ark for 4+ months beforehand
aberration is peak video game and everything else fucking sucks
actually hm debateable
p3r had a good ending aberration got a bit boring towards the end and the bossfight was a buggy mess the final cinematic was insane tho
even if p3r is better its still up there
is it better than p3 ending
idk if ill ever play a better game than p3
which characters ending
when i finished p3r i immediately went to sleep so i wouldnt cry
it worked but i still woke up depressed
it was like 4 am too lol
oh i watched the base game ascension already its like an acid trip
i also watched a 1h 30 video essay on rw once
how long without sleep
only 12h?
long periods without sleep fuck up your brain
i thought a small shark at an austrian terrarium house thingy was the weirdest shit known to man when i was on 30h+ no sleep
which is the best ending in rw
which route
and should i do my first playthrough without rw
theyre all good??????????????????????
impossible
ark: releases 4 slop maps, releases peak fiction, releases 7 more slop maps
good as in good writing or good outcome
i know saint becomes an echo
and artificer becomes an echo
unfun?
greed.....
PIXEL WHAT THE FUCK????????????????????????????????????????????????
RW STEAM KEYS ARE 4$

thats not that much but isnt us dollars banned in egypt.
is it like oneshot/undertale
what makes it unique
the character u sent whos that
kys
stupid?
also are you adding a good villai
honestly i like it most when a villain isnt some cartoonishly evil or tragic backstory but just someone with not inherently bad actions that are opposite to the protagonist's
yes i know the term is antagonist not villain but smd
oh are you making that type of villain
like mahito and barem
where you just utterly fucking DESPISE
make him more hateable than barem
@Pixel i know how much you hate ark
BUT WHY THE FUCK IS IT SPRAYING MILS OUT OF TITS FROM THE SIDE OF ITS BODY
its just an INSANELY weird ark creature
one of the devs got their fetish made into a creature i guess?
how big plot twist are we talking
are you doing that lmao
at least make them appear more throughout the story
kinda like flowey does
whats his name
whats the setting of the game
PIXELATED
FACE
I REJOINED KUUDRA GANG
AND A STAFF GUY HAS THIS IN STATUS
IT ARE SO OVER
idk what it is
OK SO HEAR ME OUT
UNDERTALE START IS AN AOT REFERENCE

will
@Pixel
how do u notice the least significant thing first
wait u should put smt like that in ur game
wonder of u
what else retard
wtf u mean 7 souls
yea undertale sub but didnt know what it meant
anyway undertale is attack on titan 1:1
- chara/frisk/whatever the fuck is the real name falls into the tree which is an entire new world and power presumably because other humans were not the nicest to them
- commits genocide by infleuncing/manipulating another abused human
huhhh
who the fuck is frisk then
ohhhh
so chara uses frisk as a vessel to genocide
by influencing frisk
actual aot reference....
yea yea same in aot its the mcs decision to genocide the long dead morally grey child with insane powers only helps
asriel is flowey right
chara killed themselves with those flowers intentionally right
~~elden ring miquella reference~~
did you ever beat sans, pixel?
how many people even have
the final attack
is geometry dash
i could never get past the final attack
why would you not

so pixie
uhhh
yeah
idk
uh
hm
do you think haru hatepegs akechi
but akechi secretly enjoys it
wait i jus realized
mitsuru is not a dommy mommy at all
in her sl she isnt dominant in the slightest
wait is kawakami actually submissive tho
thats heart shattering
i wanted her to be a dommy mommy who pegs jonkler for bad grades and shit
NAHHHHH
THIS IS JUST EVIL
japan has emo twink strip clubs?????
ghost?
WHEN HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED THE GAME
considering he never had parents
would makoto get a mommy kink for mitsy
LMFAOO @Pixel
no
@Pixel lore reason that gourmand is SO FUCKING FAT
is he a zeldalord reference
do bacon fries exist in the rw universe
is that why zelda refuses to play since theres no bacon fries
theres prob a ton in ds2

@Pixel since youre probably malnourished due to being egyptian
do you have a feminine body?
like a twink build
whats your build like then
just eat less, do a lot of cardio, dont workout at all, grow your hair out and have it all at the back and shave your entire body
COULD YOU AT LEAST HAVE LIED PIXEL
LET ME HAVE MY FANTASY OK
@Pixel
do you at least have long hair and no back and ass hair
we can make it work in thst case

LMFAOO
denji erased the aging devil in persona timeline
FYM
@Pixel @Pixel @Pixel @Pixel
DIE
no
youre an actual gooner
NVM I WANT IT NOW
SEND ME
send
WHY NOT
ITS PORN???
why are we watching porn mr pixelated face
DIE
with who
are you
in drone posting yet
can u do a eldritch design for it
pleas
na
what
no
so is he miserablus about it
PLEASE dont make it a goth twink but an actual eldritch monster
i hate when designs of cool concepts get reduced to tumblr twinks
"god of death and damnation" and his design is this
ok hear me out on this one
make it A FUCKTON of arms
and make the arms and then his head be this cross shape all together
and kinda hunched back with the coffin strapped to his back
also incorporate elements of white not just black
make his skin pure white
and dont make his head some emo shti make it some eldritch shit
youre so unoriginal
go for an uncanny valley feel
like 3-4m tall and his limbs humanoid but weirder
make some of his arms 4 or 6 fingers
make them long and slender but still thicker than the average person's
and make his head a complete anomaly maybe something thatd be like a cross
basically like fiends in csm
where they have some shit bashed into their head
do this melded thing into human head thing
but make it a white or black cross
and itd go through the head and end with the chin
where itd go down from would be like a bullet wound from behind in the head
huh
wait this would be
so good
because you could have the hair go upwards like hair would be if youre laying down in a coffin from the back
like where the coffin is
are you going for a general vibe of him being dead
wait i just realized.
this is a pixelated game
most of the shit i mentione
would only work with a high res most likely 3d design
ok you could go with this
vibe of life on him but vibe of death on his outfit
@Pixel what kind of personality are you going for for him btw?
i have an idea but explain the personality first
is he good or bad
does he wish for death
yea thats what i meant
you could go for the rarely seen approach of death
where its just someone guiding the dead towards their end
and also if you have any characters dying
make foreshadowing with him
make interesting interactions
where he doesnt explicitly say it
but it subtly shows in his sprites and dialogue that someone is near their end
oh boring i had this entire idea
make it someone whos just compassionate and kind and wants to guide souls to a (probably) walmart rw ascension without confusion so they safely reach their destination
an interesting trait would be an interaction with someone not ready to die yet and despite him probably seeing a case like that many times still feeling bad about it
@Pixel PLEASE make a sea of souls
that could be so good in a 2d pixel game
and a sick ass pale canoe
and he just talks to the person about to die there
you could also make the cemetery and sea of souls have an interesting trait
where its just a black white gray color scheme
itd add to the atmosphere at least in the guiding to death scenes
whos that character you showed btw
mc?
whats the setting of the game
oh yea how are you gonna get music for the game
music in games like os and ut is so important to the atmosphere
@Pixel whats his main facial expression gonna be
like in his character model and sprites
HEAR ME OUT YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS ITS SUCH A COOL POSE
like make his character model when guiding the souls have some kind of lantern like that
and itd be a white light
true
it could be just a gray sprite of the mc
but how do you give it this translucent sorta vibe
like its fading
you should put that all over the sea of souls
and itd be just this small circle of white light where its kind of visible
from the lantern
anyways this but hes extending his arm out of the boat
kinda like this but shorter arm obv
and the trench coat would look very good with that
ok what about a gray river
that leads to it
and then its like a waterfall down to it
and thats where he parts way with the soul
and also where you could enter it by interacting with him
what.
is that like
the silksong dev
who then
why would it be silksong related
OH THE CAKE IS A LIE SO SILKSONG IS A LIE
pure lies and bait
true
WHY DO THEY LOOK LIKE CHIHIRO AND FUUKA
no
@Pixel @Pixel @Pixel
ZELDA IS ON JUJUTSUFOLK OVER
NAHHH

i just saw the yellow and then it was gone

NAHHH
KYS!
yes
pixel
did u ever read berserk
u should
itd be funny
u could make so much rot with it pixel
endless possibilities
ENDLESS
when will you
you need to read it
it would change you worse than persona and nso did
zelda would genuinely take his fathers gun if you made berserk pj rot
i used to make berserk rot in 2021
god was it horrible
i tried to get zelda into berserk once
but didnt work
so you need to
look isnt he silly
PIXEL
GREAT SELLING POINT FOR BERSERK
THERES A COMEDIC RELIEF NAKED FAIRY
HES IN LIKE EVERY CHAPTER
THEN WAY LATER ON ALSO A FEMALE ONE
ghost
whatd u say
@Pixel
pixel?
what.
"frussy"
anyways
ok
what do u wanna see in berserk
thwres WHAT
gotta play it now
ghost
pixel

LMAO

look at the fat ass
TOXIC YAOI
sloppiest slop to have ever slopped
can this be us
:3
reaper like
WAIT WHY ARE THE GRAPHICS GOOD?
yea
i thought its like mc always same graphics
the game can acc be good?
ok hear me out
its not always the same coffin
he lets the coffin
go down the waterfall
also another way to humanise him would be making the coffin seem very heavy and make him sorta hunched back to illustrate the weight of his burden of being death
idk about ur butterfly character but
r u just making a 1:1.
pets or native to that area
how about
either glowing butterflies or fireflies
in his lantenr
the lantern can just release any amount it doesnt matter that its small
over both his eyes?
make it actual unique designs if ur giving him such basic shit
wait u figjt him?
ok sans
wait yk whatd be fire
if the end of the scythe also had a small pointy blade
and thats how he stabs himself
oh wtf
so how do u defeat him is he a secret superboss like elizabeth
from how long
itd be better if he just got bored
so like papyrus?
ok thats fire
@Pixel btw how done are you with the game
whats ur pfp
shut up
whats with you and 15 year olds from persona
fucking pedophile
d
first sumire then naoto
what about when youre 18.
the trans or not trans one?
but will your beliefs change?
kill yourself
Logan Feece Music
It's Going Down Now, but it's ATTACK ON TITAN STYLE (Persona 3 Reload)
Had a lot of fun with this Persona 3 Reload cover :) Tried to emulate the style of Hiroyuki Sawano in his Attack on Titan soundtrack "Wings OF Freedom". Let me know what you think!
OS...
peak
so many aot haters..
i hope you get uzis solver tail shoved from the ass through the mouth
what was that i couldnt see
no it wasnt
it was the old bitch from p5
post it again
same
hear me out on this one
HEAR
ME
OUT
LOOK PIXEL
fuck i genuinely cant think of anything
to push the agenda
no
ill just turn it from 1h to perma if u ask again
is it copyright if its only the ingame name
oh
youre so rotted
holy fuck
wait reminds me when
i went to venice for a day after p3 depression
and i heard persona on the radio in italy
it means person in italian
how much dyk about metaphor
i saw a post with metaphor screenshots the graphics look so good
i need to finish p5 sometime
also elden ring
how many sprites do u have made
show one for a sec
why
how
like a pattern or smt?
show
why
youve never showed me anything from the gmae
?
is it still like very early draft
that character you sent looked fine
dont you plan on releasing this.
when did you start working on it
was the "makotoifiedflochforster" part of it
when zelda pretended to not know who makoto is
because persona rot didnt breach yet
also wdyt of the song from ep8
u should rewatch then
HUH
the fuck for
i dont let my parents stay in for longer than like 1 min
why even watch it then
ep8 had quite a few scenes
not very appropriate for parents and younger brother
what type of character is it
what color is the outfit
good color but yellow eyes would be literally velvet room
what hair color and other accessories if there are some
@Pixel i was looking up
md lore on reddit
cyn is canonically a child in the manor
explain yourself, pixel
ghost
ghost again
ik not tabbed all the time
sy again
bro u deleted before i csn read
"i said stop"
KYS
thin ice
dont lie now
how can a dress make her emo
kinda looks like alula
i do that sometomes
if its a weekend or on vacation
i have
a wonderful idea
ark pacifist run
since i cant really do the main objective (beating the boss) due to needing to kill it the objective is to get all the artifacts without killing a single creature
i can only get shit like hide and meat from dinos killed by other dinos
i looked up ark on twitter and one of the first results is unspoilered uncensored resident evil porn.
im deleting this fucking app.
so some niche thing or actually viable
LMAO DO IT
endure is only once no
make it the amount of damage youre originally gonna get hit by with defense in the calculation but not the amount damage you receive
so you can use it with endure on some insanely high hp thing
ye thats the thing
make bosses like elizabeth too
make sure defense is calculated into it so if u want to use it ur gonna go for low defense
how r u doing it
and is it gonna be a party like deltarune and persona or
how do u attack
like do u jsut press smt likei n persona
can u get more than one attack
nah just like
3-5 diff attacks
can u miss ur attacks
can it repel
and can attacks be weak to a certain enemy
repel is a very underused mechanic in persona give it more strategic uses
oh yea i beat that minotaur boss in 3rd block by waiting for it to charge its strongest attack then using a phys mirror tr tr tr
i unironically know someone whod do that
do i ask?
what level of egyptianism and greed is not wanting to play elden ring to not reach 2h so i cant refund it anymore
like
i dont even plan on refunding it
im just a greedy fuck
WHAT
ok pixel
those white haired robots
from nier
what do they remind you of?
tr tr tr tr
fucking hell im depressed because i cant get myself to like ark anymore
looking back on it only one map was actually enjoyable and another was only enjoyable in retrospect because of nostalgia and attachment to it
i spent so many hours on slop
island and aberration are the ONLY good maps everything else fucking sucks and is a soulless shitty disgusting sloppy cashgrab and i hate it I HATE THIS GAME
im trying out what people call "the best map in ark" rn AND IT FUCKING SUCKS ITS JUST EVERYTHING CRAMMED ONTO ONE MAP ITS BAD I HATE IT IT SUCKS I FUCKING AHTE IT I FUCKING HATE ARK I FUCKING HATE THIS G AME I FUCKING HATE IT
rw reference

also ignore the music.
ignore the perfect sync too.
@Pixel come on watch the reaper clip
also before you ask yes my mic is heavily malfunctioning in the clip
acrually no
i sound way too bad in thst clip
just forget it
horrid HORRID game design
u get thrown into a world where everything kills u with no explanation
only explanation i got was to go to stormveil
terraria isnt bad game design the game is just fucking boring
i was able to progress without looking up shit
i was having a really great time actually but NOOOO  i have to make a hell elevator
and i kept hitting water and lava
do i just gave up on the game
great without that aspect though
NO PIXEL
THE PROBLEM IS GETTING RID OF THE LAVA
NOT DYING TO IT
oh noone told me thst...
ill pick it up again tmr
way better than elden slop
was really looking forward to wall of flesh anyway
i alr got the doll im pretty sure
so i can fight it asap
ive been there pixel
i just didnt have an elevator
i used an impracticsl tunnel that takes like 5 mins to get to hell
from my first caving experience
why?
is it insanely hard or smt
well im on normal so
how long to complete a first playthrough btw
like 80h?
agony
what.
WHAT
look
i was hoping for zelda to gift me before someone spotted a contradiction
dont blame me
skyblock scat porn
zeldas name getting slandered by a random jewish kid in f7 partyfinder
also why r u listening to some random song tht isnt a game ost wtf
wait
that one u listening to rn is so fucking good
you have a good music taste outside personaslop????
kill yourself
do you like this innocent fanart with no implications pixel

ill p rank everything when i buy the game
i removed all steam friends so i can actually buy the gsme :)
can you tell zelda im sorry and want to be besties again
im done with skyblock people

he should apologize for being a piece of shit over me pirating a game
ok i couldve sworn it was at least an hour or two wtf

WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING
DID YOU FUCKING REGIAN ME
??????????
to WHO
im 17
still weird
who did you give the idea to
dont you think
its enough to have a fake transmasc pronouns page of me (idk who made it) and super writing porn fanfiction of me already
@FlochForster • Pronouns.page
Usage examples of personal pronouns and gender neutral language.
alreqdy asked zelda and its fake
this could be us but NOOOOO youre still closeted
whyyy
lets be cute depressed suicidal lesbian robot girls
lets have a double suicide <3
lets just do hot depressed robot lesbian shit together then
ngl
id cum if u did that to me
imagine were cute lesbian robot girls and you just physically abuse the fuck out of me
actually fuck this shit
no more bait
im reformed
te but tmr
isnt it 1am for you.
look pixel
if i ever gooned
itd be to yoru
and shes 18
what do you mean for now
people dont age backwards
unless you read some yaoi about that or something
oh my god war is so fucking good
i love it
or
i bedrot on twitter
:)
actually fuck
i gotta workout and run today
fuck man
i hate everything
i bedrot to silly cat and dog videos
ive managed to make my twitter feed mostly that
the rest is just neonazi and elon musk shit (impossible to get rid of)
how it was my entire feed when i downloaded twitter
twitter REALLY REALLY wants me to follow elon musk for some reason
excuse me
EXCUSE ME??
are you depressed yet
lets get matching sh scars and show them to each other
i follow only the jjk leaker
same
but like years ago
omori is way too edgy
also what happened to timeout, pixel?
in your head or
why would you schizo up so many different things before finishing one of them?
show the mc
of the current game youre making
also wtf is the name
ok so ill take it like this
the name is stupid and temporary or theres no name
first letter?
is the name dex
agony
lets just say
adachi has a sexual awakening in store for me in august
zeldas young teacher with the persona moon sticker
is ms toriumi in the zeldalordic persona universe
and they will bond over and have a social link when zelda opens okbp in pc class
??????????????????????????????
you could manipulate me into hurting myself
isnt that hot
you fear the contents of my pc
if zelda is 18 then
you can make
the idea you wanted to make
so long ago
ok so
what that word meant
the term cuny
means
the uh
of a loli
ok all ill say is that he unironically jerks off
to
well
we need to
find super
and kill him
shoot him to death
super roblox profile
someone needs to shoot him
do you ever just get hit with a huge realization at 3am
holy fuck im crashing out on everyone when i wake up
"25 days until wipe" yea youre completely right im gonna call architecthor then stream using killaura in hub 1 to selfban and selfwipe the account

is that cactabyte
wait why was ur ign pixelatedface
what happened to that account
how much did u pay for it
i used to buy alts for like 2$ and i still have access to a lot of them
how long did it last
why was it ign pixelatedface then
who tf owns it
wait so
zelda played on a cracked server
so your egypt ass could play mc
then how did you meet zelda on a server
whyd he be on a cracked server
could mecatt not afford a mc account
let me guess
magnus couldnt afford an account either
what ign did he have
LMAO
does not exist
ohh
cuz when i looked up pixelatedface
someone had that
then why not pick something actually cool
like Pex
or Extinction
or Amogus
oh no i have money noooo
did you get a mc account the moment you saw an orespawn video and thought it looked cool?
thats sad
whats ur average meal
yummy

it is
do u have a wyvern pixel
do you have a morellatops to conserve water
what about jerboas to alert you of weather
these are mine jerboas
look at the names
you fucking WISH hollow knight was this good
look its smegma gobbler, balls fondler and urethra pincher
WHAT
that looks peak????
its like this area from aberration
wtf
is this aura
ic an see why
how late into the game is it
whats desolate dive
wait cool movement shit exists wtf???
so its ultrakill but 2d??
also is it actually slow as fuck
i told thomas to play ultrakill today and he said hes more used to slower shit like hk
with souls like do you mean ill get ambushed by something i cant actually fight for a while in a place thats said to be safe?
ok but how bullshit is it
will you have a fight against something that takes 30+ hits to kill that can onetap you 4h into the game?
said onetap is a big aoe btw
so like smoke bomb in cuphead
is there any random huge difficulty spikes
theres no unfair shit correct
also no unfair bugs (looking at you ark survival evolved)
is path of pain fun when you learn the mechanics of the game
ultrakill brutal is SO fun when you actually know the mechanics and techs
i love completely skipping 3-2 gabriel's first phase in 2 seconds

Lets talk about the mandible now
Okay can we now talk about the Kuudra Mandible again thank you
Boar
HOW MANY DIFFERENT BOARS ARE THERE
I NEED ALL
Dragoon updated the kuudra mandible server in desc to this lol
What abt boar-chain (we have 1 in boar channel but lets make seperate)
The Kuudra Mandible is an Epic Reforge Stone applied to Fishing Rods.
Did we try plhlegblast fully killed with alch staff
What if Plhlegblast is the condition?
What is the hard part and condition of Believer? For legs the hard part was divan and condition cataclysmic. For boots hard part was collection and condition nether warts growing so loremaster appears.
W8 does corrupt fishing give more fishing exp on corrupted scc's?
Yay imma get fishing 27 in no time
Then i can helo get plhlegs
Rlly?
Since this is mandible discord, mods pls delete off topic stuff
Can we now talk about the kuudra mandible again thank you
Didnt some1 at hypixel staff say its completely possible to do everything rn and not bugged?
What if we have to bring a sea emperor to jacob? (Dont beam me pls)
R the channels in dragoon's server still there?
Is there an archive?
Do we have access to all stuff from in the "tried to bring sea emp to jake" era?
K
First we should prioritze the parts with bearded's list and the 20 - 22 hour era
Finally some quality mandible content
Can we now talk abt the mandible again
Guys we went off topic again
*It's Mandiblin' time
Not in tested ideas so
Did we shoot plhleg with sulphur bow or get him to a sulphur block
Second could do smth
Since plhleg is prob an infant of the kuudra species
Did we try sulphur coal
I splashed myself with god pot around plhleg in 1st fishing party
Hm, r there any addon brews in barb or mage shop
Oh ye did we try wisp's ice flavored potion
So give believer proof that plhleg is an infant of kuudra species?
Did we try wisp's ice flavored potion
Ye it has been tried i believe
Arch says "stand united". Its most likely related to factions or different kuudra armors
W8
It cant be kuudra armors
Cuz hollow unreleased
And hunt shouldbe 100% completeable
What if believer doesnt know plhleg is infant of kuudra species and we gotta prove it to him with saying lines from the fight? Were all the lines tested alrdy?
Oh ye i forgor 💀 about that lol
So in old mc version squids could be milked
What if we gotta try empty bucket
I tested all but empty
Any ideas on how to show believer plhleg is kuudra species baby
Ummmmm is it stated anywhere? 🤓
Stop saying uwu
Mods help
Its Mandiblin' time
So we gotta show believer we believe in kuudra or prove to him plhleg is baby kuudra specimen
Why would plhleg be cathable anywhere else? Its literally called Plhlegblas Pool
The lore of island says crimson isle was prvsly inhabitated by peaceful pig farmers then something something volcano
Wait
I think i just found out smth
The barbs
Were prvsly pigs
Now piglins
What if kuudra is sulphurified plhleg
And plhlegs r the first ones
Sulphur made farmers mages. Pigs to piglins. Squid into lava kraken. Maybe this explains y plhleg dies in lava, cuz kuudra is the evolved enhanced version
Another theory: what if plhleg is kuudra's child and kuudra steals sulphur to feed it so it grows into a kuudra?
What if kuudra is evolved from plhleg after the whole volcano thing happened and changed the whole population of the isle
Plhleg is just a squid. It dies to lava and isnt hostile.
The plhlegs evolved into kuudras. There are many
Kuudras being evolved from plhlegs like mages evolved from farmers and barbs from pigs after volcano is now my headcanon
What if we have to find out ehat plhleg is to connect it to believer first?
What if same thing happened to plhlegs? Maybe thats y kuudra wants sulphur so much
Ye, like mages and barbs. They also want sulphur. Its kinda implying that kuudra is evolved from plhleg
The 1b bank gdrag was a joke lol
Duck legs tastiest imo (pls dont beam me)
Ye i made as shitpost
Kuudra is evolved Plhleg Kuudra is evolved Plhleg
Listen to my whole explanation please
So barbs were pigs and mages were farmers
After volcano they became corrupted by sulphur
So it would make sense kuudra was evolved from plhleg since there wasnt lava b4 volcano. Also explains y plhleg dies to lava.
How can we connect plhleg to believer if we dont know what plhleg is
AOTD ability
Lava kraken that dies from lava. Makes 100% sense.
Beam moment
Thats the logic
Did we try items made from sulphur and spell powder on plhleg?
Plhleg is just like the pigs piglins used to be. Then volcano came and turned farmers into mage, pigs into barbs and plhlegs into kuudras.
Ok
I would put in suggestions but suggestions dont exist
You do not have permission to send messages in this channel.
How do u get rookie
I had rookie alrdy today but its gone
cya
What is our current plan for plhleg
Yay hunt ideas unlocked
Corm has to be related to a step of mandiblin' hunt.
That ties in to a theory i heard on dragoon's server
That there is an NPC that gives clues for each piece
Was there a clue NPC for legs?
If there was one, theres prob one for believer piece too
Netherwart guy and book guy
Ok so
Netherwart guy clue for boots and book guy clue for legs
That means there's gotta be one for believer and corm is prob the one for arch (ill explain y)
Back to believer ig
W8
It is related to believer
We gotta find npc
That gives clue for believer
Like for prvs 2 pieces
Lets try to find an npc that gives clue to get believer's piece
Since we had those for prvs 2 pieces and i think ik which r for arch and drakuu
No order
I didnt say it was. Its prob for arch
I said we gotta find the clue npc for believer
Like nethereart guy and book guy
Not anymore
Barb guy that says he likes watching netherwart grow. I meant netherwart guy
Dungeon hournals 99.99999% not related
Not confirmed
Can we stop talking about journals and talk abt mandible
Book guy was useful tho
Fake ss lol
So back to what i was saying. Book guy for legs, netherwart guy for boots, there must be some npc for believer. Im putting all my faith of solvinf believet into an unconfirmed npc lol
Would be strange if 2 pieces had hint npcs and other wouldnt
Also i think ik the hint npcs for arch and drakuu
I think aura not related to hunt imo
Npc that doesnt exist, bless me with your hint
Did u find anything yet?
Mollim gives enchant when splashed with titanic bottle
Splash him with collosal bottle
What npc could give a clue for believer
I am rn lol
I found this Rulenor guy
U gotta pay him 10k to take a photo of him
Could it be related to believer cuz coins?
Netherwart barb guy for boots, book mage guy for legs
Believer hint npc is prob smth my brain came up with to cope
As a last resort
Ive read through wiki a lot these days
Most related thing is mage guy that u pay to take photos of
So prob no hint npc
Love potion
Mentioned in magmag lore
Could the vampire guy u give cup of blood to every day
Be relaed to mandiblin hunt
Ideas for next pleggy?
Go find a lobby where
There is a sulphur block within the radius where pleg doesnt despawn
And bring pleg to it
Y
Personally i will dedicate myself to solving believer so we get to most likely arch
I think arch will be fun
I tried all buckets except empty
Clicking on pleggy
Im doing the exact opposite.
Im dedicating myself so we solve believer
So then we can do arch (arch best)
Im reading wiki to do believer
Look for believer hints too
Im reading all crimson isle stuff rn :)
💀
There is an npc called Suus
With a child named Turd
I just injected a lethal dose of copium into myself
Sirih is believer hint npc
He is pig
You give him sulphur
No im on copium
Dont listen to me
It makes sense to me but to others its like an insane person rambling
And he turns into piglin
This could maybe hint that we gotta turn Plhleg into kuudra
My prvs theory was that like piglins evolved from pigs
Kuudra evolved from pleg
No
And its telling us
Volcano and sulphur
We gotta turn pleg into kuudra
This was just copium rambling dont beam me
Yes
My theory is
It turned from squid
To sulphur lava kraken
(I am on lethal dose of copium send help)
It also makes thing go insane
Mage Outlaw's lore mentions he ate too much sulphur or smth
So a passive pleg could be made into a destructive kuudra
Except me (i am copium addict)
No
First part was some equation
Thats the only doubt in my theory
Alchemist staff?
Hehehe ha
My copium theory
Sirih talks about his novels
Imma analyze that rq
Gn
@Roookieboy
I found some lore for u
Sirih
Made a novel about wither king and his wife
Sirih is interesting
He is pig turned barb with sulphur guy
The main point in my copium theor
Theory
Cya
Another part of my theory
U guys know Chickzilla?
Well another innocent animal turned monster by sulphur
Igrupan even mentions
🤡
That its hard to find non-sulphur corruptes chickens or smth
So there could be some animals that didnt evolve into the sulphir versions
Like the pleg
My theory is that plegs evolved into kuudras when volcano
Chickzilla implies even more of that
Guys
We gotta turn pleg into kuudra
Vote on this post:
In lore, crimson isle was a peceful farming island. Blazing fortress is excluded from lore
Plhleg is so rare cuz there r so few of normal plegs left
That also explains the WOAH! A Plhlegblast msg
It is tho
Believer sees kuudra. He sees we believe in it
Same lol
My headcanon is that kuudra is evolved sulphurified pleg
gn
The amount to donate is most likely related to pleg turning into kuudra
Idm how we get number from that tho
Ok so wats the general idea for pleg and believer rn
Imagine dia sulphur skitter to pleg lol
Wot
I hope its not the 700m one
oh ye pigicial, is sulphur better than copium?
That theory is even more coped than mine
Its time for my crackpot theory
COPIUM CRACKPOT THEORY:
Ive been saying this for the last 4 hours
Wat fishing lvl so u have to be to catch lava shells
Kuudra is evolution of plhleg, like barbs r evolution of pigs. Both cuz sulphur
Ive been saying this since 1st fishing party
Doubt, cuz its not adapted to lava
Ye
Who is volunteering to donate the sulphur backpack amounts of money?
Us migrating to this server was a very good move. We can actually have full discussions about the hunt.
Next time funny squid
We try pig's idea to donate
Can we now talk about the kuudra mandible again thank you
What item is worth almost the same as divan drill
Is gdrag worth the same as divan drill
Wat item can be used as collat for divan drill
I have hyp and gdrag
Would gdrag work? (My hyp 1 of first 100 dont wanna lose)
Does any1 here collat trade for divan's (trusted and wont scam)
Ye
We shouls make divan collat trade system
Can we talk about believer now
Some1 make a #hunt-guides chat channel for conversations like this 1
Ok gtg now cya tmmrw
Did some1 say boar
I just woke up
We named the rift on top of mountain brayden
Beam moment
Magmag
Says its used in love potions
Here is my copium theory:
Is this a joke idea
Mods this is y we gotta make an arricle ppl must read b4 talking
Ye
You gotta be trolling
Mods make an article for these ppl to read
Y dont they read it?
Okay can we talk about kuudra believer now thank you
Beam moment
Beam moment 2
I think calamity is smth different and bigger unrelated to mandible
I cant wait for Arch
Ye, ik im trynna do everything to solve believer rn
It was never confirmed corm is actually related to arch tho
Ye but we cant say anything is for sure in this hunt
We need plhleg for the donation amount tho
Gn
It is 5 am here
But i wont sleep until lava kraken jaw is found
We need to solve believer
When next fishing party
Believer hint npc in my brain coping
Aura is 99.9999% not related to hunt
Aura has big lore potential
Smth is setting up with Brayden and new lore drops on whole skyblock history
It is
Hint npcs. Book guy for legs, netherwart guy for boots. We need hint npc for believer. (Help me i overdosed on copium)
Aurora is armor. Aura is evil scientist. Hollow armor is unreleased
Could Rulenor be related to hunt
U have to give him 10K ao u can take photo of him
Mage npc u pay 10k to so u can take a photo of him
Ye
Y they called can be used as mandibles
LMFAO ROFL SO FUNNY HAHA
Loremaster didnt need another npc, unless u count 3 ppl talking abt a disturbance on nearby island
What does the hero have to do with believer tho
What item is gud collat for divan's
Is gdrag enough
Lvl 200 with minos relic. Wait could it be too much?
Can i find some1 here who is trusted and would return my gdrag
Is there any1 trusted enough in this discord that would trade me back my gdrag
Well i have collat, so...
(Real and very incredible)
Y is chaos banned?
Btw im paying 25m to whoever lets me borrow their divan's (must be trusted) (i have gdrag collat)
Whoever here is pleg fishing
Go to a lobby
Where there is sulphur block within pleg not despawning distance
Is any1 here double hook fishing
ßßßßß
Who is pleg fishing rn regardless of double hook
When u go fish
Find a lobby
With sulphur block that is in plegblast radius
To my knowledge we didnt bring it to a sulphur block
Impossible
Find guards for it
Breh
Anyways
Find a sulphur block lobby
Fish there
I might be able to log on today
gm
So i can guard it
Find lobby with sulohur block nearby and also 4 wither cloak guards
Mine is soublound (3rd ever made)
Did we fish  a pleg yet
:psquid:
Lets find a lobby with sulphur in pleg distance
And get 4 wither cloak guards
While some ppl fish
Ok imma search for it and will tell u to party me when i find
First i gotta get out of bed tho
We have 4 confirmations sulphur makes things go insane.
Plhlegs were nornal squids until volcano and sulphur appeared
Yes
Mage outlaw is evil cuz they overdosed on sulphur
One of igrupan's chickens became chickzilla cuz of suphur
Farmers became mages, pigs became barbs
So it only makes sense...
That Kuudras evolved from Plhlegs
Turn Plhleg into Kuudra like u can turn the pig npc into a barb
Whats our best idea to turn Plhleg into Kuudra
Corrupt plhleg and bring to sulphur block
Plhleg is Kuudra from b4 volcano and sulphur when crimson isle was peaceful farmers
4 wither cloak guards
(and very incredible)
Imma right click plhleg with 64 sulphur cubes
💀
Why would some1 suggest that
We have a channel for saying Boar, dont do it here
Like pigs turned to barbs and farmers to mages, plegs turned to kuudrad after sulphur appeared and volcano came
No, kuudra is evolved plhleg after sulphur. Pleg is the prvs passive version from b4 volcano came
Ye, non-evolved plegs have become extremely rare
Turn pleg into kuudra
Find sulphur block lobby
Sulphur block + corrupt
Pig find a sulphur block lobby
Im in italy rn
Pig r u in a lobby with sulphur block in pleg radius
(and very incredible)
Nop

Cinderbat just serves to make everburning flame harder to get
Does any1 in this discord lend it out who's trusted?
We were prob on the right track on 1st fishing party alrdy
Jacob said if we dont solve believer by when he wakes up were not officially nerds
Whatever
We were on the right track back then
I have ss

I was there the entire time
Even when almost every1 left

AQUA
Y R U HERE
This isnt me
This is aqua
Ok
Just dont troll
If u want to beg for my hyp go to boar channel for that
Mandiblin' time now
I did
Like 2 months ago
@Deleted User
If u wanna help us read the article
Were trynna solve believer rn
Gris mentions matriarch has prob been here longer than volcano
@Deleted User
Do u want my hyp
Ok listen to my theory
When volcano and sulphur came a peaveful farming island was turn into nether wasteland
Farmers became mages amd pigs barbs
We know theres not a lot of normal animsls on crimson isle
Igrupan mentions it was hard to get non corrupted chickens
But then a  chciken becomes chickzilla
Also it says for mage outlaw
That he overdosed on sulphur or smth
Thats y he evil
So we know sulphur corrupts and evolves things
Plhlegblast
Is like farmers and pigs
But now they are kuudras
Thats y plhleg is so rare
We gotta show believer that plhlegblast can be turned to kuudra
Aqua
Did you even listen to my theory
The entire kuudra species
WAIT ANOTHER POINT IN MY THEORY
PLHLEG DIES TO LAVA
B4 VOLCANO THERE WAS NO LAVA
The plhleg pool was prob just normal squids, plhlegs
Then sulphur camr and turned em into kuudras
Ok thx for listening now u get my term
Aqua
Aqua
Today im clicking plegy with 64 sulphur cubes
Believer sees kuudra ib front of him when we evolve pleg into kuudra
Im broke rn, but imma give u my term soon
Not funny
I can literally get full inv of sulphur today if i sell my gdrag
Which im planning to
To get divans

CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE FRCIKING MANDIBLE NOW
You are god
Its mandiblin' time
I tried with 1 during 1st party
Yes
@Deleted User STOP stealing my theories
SULPHUR
this
Tier into my theory
The sulphur evolution theory
No. When sulphur came it mutated all Plhlegs into kuudras cuz so much sulphur
All kuudras r like that tho
Guys do you wanna hear my Sulphur Evolution theory for the 3836212th time?
Elle fishes up a new one every time tho
Yes, variants. There are many Kuudras. Elle says "this one". They are species evolved from plhleg
Pwease believe my sulphur evolution theory 🥺
It is evident Kuudra mutated from something. Plhleg was like the pigs that mutated to barbs but it mutated to kuudra instead cuz it was exposed to more sulphur
All variants
VOTE:
Ratio
Sulphur evolution we gotta evolve Plhleg into Kuudra like other Plhlegs evolved into it
Sulphur block
Ties into lore
Cuz 1st volcano eruption brought sulphur
And mutated stuff
Sulphur Evolution
time to take a shot
AQUA STOP
Oh no
Some1 said barry
Another shot ig
Aqua
Change ur pfp
Or ur nsme
Too late
Bring a corrupted plhlegast to a sulphur block
It makes 100% sense with sulphur evolution theory
Kuudra
Believer does smth
Or we get number
Totem of corruption
Is the other thing tru?
Thats for suplhur skitter
DOES ANY1 HAVE A DIAMOND SULPHUR SKITTER
If some1 has a diamond sulphur skitter in item form tell me now
Theyre soulbound
And i dont need 1
Just whoever has it
Test on plhleg
Hacked
Diamond sulphur skitter + plhleg would make sensr
@Deleted User
Oops
Srry aqua
SULPHUR EVOLUTION Theory
So basically
Crimson isle was a peaceful island inhabited by farmers and pigs
Then volcano came and sulphur caused farmers became mages and pigs barbs cuz sulphur
So it makes sense
Plhlegs evolved into kuudras
We have mage outlaw that overdosed on sulphur and became evil
And igrupan mentions its hard to get non-corrupted chickens
And one of his chickens becomes a chickzilla monster
they dont reuse stuff in the hunt
Sulphur skitter is a fish corrupted by sulphur
Kuudra LOVES sulphur
So makes sense
That a lava kraken evolved from water squids due to sulphur
There was no lava b4 volcano and sulphur
Now i will writr the sulphur evolution into my desc so if ppl wanna know what it is they read my desc
190 character limit 💀
For desc
Guys do u now all know the sulphur evolution
Im on phone
How do i make it my desc
Done
link doesnt work
No cataclysmic bruh
They dont reuse stuff
Ye a sulphur block
We can write off plhleg in cata eruption
Not an eruption
Sulphur
Ok
If its plhleg during cataclysmic i will buy boar furry clothes thing
Sulphur evolution. Kuudra needs sulphur to not revert back to a plhleg.
Guys sulphur evolution makes even more sense now
Kuudra steals sulphur
So it doesnt become a plhleg again
The Plhlegs we fish
Are kuudras that didnt get their sulphur
We gotta give em sulphur
But it just keeps pointing to this
Everything does
Pacifist kuudra run should be done with full kuudra follower imo
Sulohur block
Yes
Plhleg is a kuudra that detransformed after not getting sulphur
Also possible
But all evidence points to kuudra being a sulphur evolution of plhleg
And thst kuudra turns to plhleg after not getting sulphur
Yes
1 day
All evidence of sulphir evolution
Is pointing to sulphir block on plhleg
Pig r u still fishin?
We tried all other sulphur related stuff
Try finding a lobby
With sulohur block in plhleg radius
Also corrupt the plhleg
B4 block
Gl
Pig pls just lobby swap to like 25 lobbies try to see if sulphur block
Cuz im not online
How much in total
K thanks
And corrupting plhleg
Curent goal is
Turning plhleg into kuudra
Cuz Sulphur Evolution points to it
We find em
In lobbies
No
Our goal is turning Plhleg into Kuudra
Thats the purpose of Sulphur Evolution theory
Plhleg becoming Kuudra
Ok so sulphur evolution makes even more sense now
Our goal is lobby with sulphur block in pleg radius
70 blocks i believe
Noice
Now get plhleg
And also corrupt it
GUARDS
WE NEED
Kuudra is sulphur evolved Plhleg
Whats our plan if this doesnt work
Imma join soon
He's alrdy sus. Look up scientific name of pig
Sus Scrofa
We have Pigicial
But where is Boaricial?
Lets make a petition.
If pigicial's amounts of money work
He has to change his name in server to Boaricial for 1h
Should Pigicial rename himself to Boaricial for a bit if his idea works?
Yes
He reacted with a boar lol
Yes we are
Ok guys
Wanna hear sulphur evolution for the 283773882627848266264th time
(and very incredible)
🐗
Sulphur Evolution
Ok just dont steal Sulphur Evolution
YOU HAVE BETRAYED BOAR
No its different
It could also be a kuudrs
That detransformed from kuudra to plhleg
Jungleboar, Kuudra can get so small cuz its states it ate way more sulohur than anything else
Plhleg is it's og form
Also do u know the those 2 guys at gate
They prob know that
Cuz they say that there is enough sulphur for kuudra
If a kuudra would completely stop eating sulphur it could be possible
Time to take a shot guys
NO
NO
NO
PAIN AND SUFFERING
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Y did u do that ping
Oh ok
Smth else pinged me then
I got pinged in dms
We gotta find new lobby with sulphur
We can find new lobby
Instead
Wat do we do if Corrupted Plhleg + Sulphur block doesnt work
Bruh y r ppl like this
Only Boar is good
(and very incredible)
Jacob said we were on 1st fishing party
Pogo have u heard of Sulphur Evolution
Even if not related to believer
Sulphur evolution has lore potential
Maybe for the final step
W8 i just remembered smth
Sulphur evolution makes absolutely no sense
Cuz it doesnt tie in believer
Maybe it does smth still
It'd be nice to try at least
Lets sulphur block search
Maybe it gives number
When it turns to kuudra
Pls dont tell me were abandoning sulphur block searching
Lets just try
Hotel wifi moment
Imma try to log in tho
I maybe can in like 1 hour
How many wither cloak guards we got
Lets just try it
I cant go online
Also its the only sulphur related thing we didnt try yet
What if i find a lobby with the block
It makes no difference in plhleg fishing efficiency if lobby with sulphur than if not
Ok imma guard alone
Cuz im not high enough lvl to fish
Maybe i can get boar fan 2 to fish
Can we now talk about the mandible
Can we talk about the fricking mandible
Whats our cureent plan for believer and plhleg
How much would all the other 10 more expensive amounts of money to give to believer be all together?
If pig's idea wont work
Lets try SuLPHUr EVOLuTIOn
We have no other ideas if pig's doesnt work tho
Ss?
Gimme ss
Ill do it myself
The theory isnt just bringing plhleg to sulphur block
Does any1 have ideas that involve believer
Pigicial has 30 donation values to give. Give it to him so he can also do the more expensive ones
30 dofferent numbers to donste
Does donating those values to believer tie in plhleg other than the fact its alive then?
Me too
I was lvl 40 (real and very incredible)
How to get from fishing 24 to 27 very fast
If the cow shedders join...
But most of their suggestions... 💀💀💀
Is SuLPHUr EVoLUTIOn off-topic?
Dont beam me if this is off topic but
Y dont the libks work
To 2nd jacob list
Is the archive done?
Can we get early access to just the jacob list
I thought it didnt exist anymore
Is 2nd jacob list pinned there?
Ye ik its pinned but links dont work. Imma go to dragoon's and read there
1b bank was a shitpost i made 💀
Can some1 gimme a link to dragoon's discord
The links in his vids dont work
What makes the most sense on the list is dmging plhleg and donating that number
But jacob could also be reffering to smth that happened in-game
But still makes more sense than other things thete
And most things there have been tested
One question
Did skins of npcs ever matter
What if plhlegblast is the condition
Me trying not to say SulPHuR eVoLUTIoN (impossible)
Oh no im about to say it...
I dont think THE theory should be discarded. The idea with sulphur block should be, but THE theory still kinda makes sense
Pleg brought to sulphur block doesnt even tie in with THE theory.
Pogo pls dont ban the theory, it still makes sense, just the sulphur block thing doesnt
Some1 almost achieved it in that timespan
Oh ok i can now stop mentioning it
I was defending it so it wouldnt be banned
I have other ideas too
Was there a fishing party in the 2nd hacob list timespan
No im not saying it again
Just search sulphur evolution
SOMEONE WAS ASKING ABOUT IT THATS Y I SAID IT
U know the theory now?
Its called sulphur evolution, but if i mention it again i get beamed
Bcuz NO.
@Deleted User Aqua stop
Aqua stop
Pls
Ur not funny
Pogo i changed my mind ban sulphur evolution
Even if sulphur evolution is true
It isnt related to believer
Aqua
Stop saying the theory is a fact
It is a theory
Guys smth new about sulphur evolution
What if the condition is plhleg
And it can achieve smth bigger
As in turning into kuudra
That the jacob line about condition being part of smth bigger
Could tie in to THE theory
Condition being part of smth bigger achieve great things or smth
So we have to find out what the smth bigger part is
Maybe bein blessed by believer?
No
No
Ye but not a different weapon
I thought he ment a bers weapon as in a melee weapon lol
Plhleg is just a squid
But when its part of smth bigger
It can become kuudra
Kuudra is a lava kraken
Ive disregarded sulfur evo completely
But plhleg becoming kuudra could be solution still
Plhleg is the condition when part of smth bigger it becomes kuudra
What could be the smth bigger
Nah
The smth bigger is prob some trigger/condition
What if we when jacob said the condition can achieve something greater when part of something bigger
He wws reffering to plhleg can schieve something bigger
Mandra
Mandra is an actual item. Unreleased power stone from burning kuudra. Nothing i said was off topic
Btw boar fan 2 made an alt callee boar fan 3
STOP THINKING OF IT
ITS JUST A THEORY
DONT THINK ABOUT IT
How desperate do we have to be to bring plhleg to a  sulphur block
(and very incredible)
If I bring plhleg to a sulphur block all by myself and it works you are legally obliged to give me 3 coins! (real and very incredible!
Beam
Beam to the duck
W8 pogo doesnt have hunter role for some reason
Can we now talk about the fricking mandible
SuLPHur evOLuTIOn
I was jk lol
Its a joke
The capitalization screams that its a joke
I only said once as a joke
Boar fan 2 spamming it
#sulphurevo-channel confirmed? (Im jk dont beam me)
Lets go talk about sulphur evo in #general
When can i seriously talk abt the sulphur evolution theory? (Not plhleg to sulphur block)
Oh ye
I have access to that now yay
But problem is its not an idea but theory
How does ideas bot work
But there is no expected result, just a theory
Yay fishing 24
3 lvls to pleg
Related cuz i need 3 lvls to pleg
Is there fishing party rn
When next party
FOUND A
SULPHUR BLOCK
AT OPENING OF
PLEG POOL
Fishing 24
So cant
Ithe the perfect lobby
We can bring pleg
AQUA
LEMME PARTY U
FISH FOR ME
I PAY U
I found the sulphur block lobby for pleg
NO I GOT DISCONECTED
I GOTTA SEARCH FOR NEW ONE NO
Ill send ss
It was the perfect location
Any1 wanna pleg fish?
R we gonna try sulphur block if this drags on for 1 more month or still no?
Wats our current idea for pleg rn
Ok Sulphur Evolution Theory posted in ideas with all details!
Whats our idea for pleg rn
Me and the other boar fan 2 can guard, and we can do it only incase some1 finds a lobby like that instead of actively searching for one
Also i can search for those lobbies
I found 2 in like 25 lobby swaps
Like right at entrance of pool
Ive told him so many times lol. Just tell him he gets kicked from BOARPIRE if he doesnt and he'll change it
Is 2 ppl enough to block a person from mining sulphur
Is 4 ppl enough
Anyways
If u find a lobby with sulphur block bring plhleg to it, wont hurt to try
Btw
The lobby i found has 2 ppl
It was perfect
Then i will spam hyp on top of it so ppl wont see wats in explosion
I had lobby with sulphur at entrance of plhleg pool with 2 ppl in lobby 💀
Just normally fish
In normal lobby
And i search for sulphur
Then u party me if u wanna fish there
Me and other boar fan (guards) dont have fishing 27
Can we now
Thibk of best setup for sulphur pleg fishing
No, how to optimize ppl guarding block and ppl fishing
Wat if they betray me
Its our only idea rn
Lets try it
Yes
Try the sulphur block thing, whoever does it gets my hyp (very real and even more incredible)
Thats jungleboar. My nw is around 4.8b - 5.4b
Y sulphur cubes. We gotta bring plhleg to sulphur block
Have we tried bringing a Plhlegblast to Sulphur block?
This isnt related to sulphur evo + we have no other ideas
No cuz hotel wifi is mean
Poll:
@Deleted User can u stop
Aqua just stop
Beam him entirely
Lets wait for more ideas
And then
Use em on 1 pleggy
Including the block
When we get more ideas
Will we also test the sulphur block
Alongside other ideas
That some1 alrdy suggested the idea, but we alrdy wrote it off (IM NOT TALKING ABOUT SULPHUR BLOCK)
I am boar fan number 1 btw
Im not talking about i
Its just a name
Jacob's line was a metaphor smh my head
Ok so lemme explain cuz boar fan 2 is very smart
Jacob's iconic line is most likely talking about the fact we alrdy wrote off the solution (since in golden ball hunt, it was put on a list of tested ideas)
What likely solution to believer have we alrdy written off
Bcuz jacob's funny line
Prob means we alrdy written off solution
Aqua i saw what u said
Not enough time lol
Lol even otsu does kuudra on a daily basis
It was my main money making method
Like 80m in 6 hours
Evwn otsu makes some money from it
Now lets talk about mandible
Can we now talk abt the frickin mandible
Ok so what if there is no other thing. Its just simple
Its just bringing plhleg to believer
ye ik
Were missing smth
A trigger or condition
Maybe its that simple, but we just need a trigger
FOEGET IT
Boar fan 2 bein annoying
I am not boar fan anymore
I am sulphur evolution
Oh no
Thats gonna go out of  o text
I dont hate boars
Just my username isnt boar fan anymore
Guys what if its just bringing plhleg to believer but were missing a condition/trigger
For example, u cant get kuudra relic unless u clicked the book
You cant get kuudra relic unless you click the book. So, what if its just plhleg to believer but we need smth like that
I love this conversation related to the mandible!
What if were missing a trigger
Now it all makes sense to me
What if jacob meant
With the line
That like when some1 brought normal sea emp and didnt work but worked with soul
What if were missing a trigger
And its just plhleg to believer
Ye, but it could mean that were doin smth right but missing smth
No, i meant its that but we are missing a trigger
NO STOP
IT ISNT SULPHUR
YOURE MAKING MY BRIAN HURT
I will never say any ideas again bcuz whenever i say a theory @Deleted User takes it for granted
Pls say ur trolling
This is chaos
Ban sulphur evolution theory
Can we now talk abt what the trigger/condition could be
Stop
Just stop
Some1 help
Im losing my mind
Now i want the sulphur block thing to be tested even more
SO EVERY1 STOPS TALKING ABOUT IT
Finally some common sense. We should look into the jacob lists and stop talking about stupid sulphur
Can you pls ban sulphur evolution theory its slowing down the hunt massively
Can u tell boar fan 2 to stop talking abt it
The theory isnt the problem
Boar fan 2 talking abt sulphur is
No matter the subject, boar fan 2 will talk abt it. Its very problematic
As a meme
Hes saying it srsly
STOP
Y WOULD IT BE THE OBLY POSSIBLE OBE
Beam
Ok now time for some actual mandible discussion
So remember 4k mana bookshelf? Relic isnt possible without it. What if its smth simple, but we're missing the trigger?
Yes
Ok were missing condition and trigger for believer
Both prvs steps
Needed condition and trigger
Condition was cataclysmic for legs and tuesday for boots
Trigger was kuudra line for boots and 4k mana book for legs
So were missing trigger and condition in this part
We should look into
Trigge and condition suggestions in jacob lists
Following prvs patrerns we need trigger and condition
What couls be trigger and condition in this part
What is the condition tho
We have all parts
We just gotta sort em
Intk right place
Ok so we have believer, donation to believer and plhlegblast
We need to sort those things
What is trigger, condition and grind part
Nah, they used that for loremaster appearing
Is plhlegblast the condition or grind part
Is pleg condition or grind part?
Y trigger?
What would be the trigger to allow us to complete it
Maybe we did right thing but didnt have trigger
Like some1 could mine the block but wouldnt get relic cuz didnt click on the book
So we maybe did it alrdy
But didnt have trigger
What if jacob meant
Were on the right track but missing smth
Aot
Wot
I only donated like 100m in total
We have to find the trigger
And then do what we alrdy did
That might be it
What could the trigger be
Does any1 have any ideas what the trigger for believer could be? (Trigger as in the kuudra line for loremaster and 4k mana book for relic)
Ye, we gotta sort out the things
What is the grind part, the trigger part and condition part
Ye but could also be condition
Although unlikely
Ye possibly
But
We need trigger
Like the kuudra line or 4k book
Here its fishing up a plhleg
Even harded imo
Yes
The thing my brain came up bcuz of copium
A hint npc for believer
Whats the idea for pleg rn...
We have to find the trigger first imo
What if trigger hint npc is Rulenor
U gotta pay him 10k to take a photo of him
i was too prvsly
Ok
What npc could possibly be hinting at trigger for believer
Pleggy is prob grind or condition part
It makes the most sense for the final step to be a donation, not plhleg becoming kuudra tho
So maybe, we need to trigger smth b4
No that idea was shit and were not doing it
Boar fan 2 told me he gonna be back in 8 mins 💀
Ok now lets talk abt the mandible
If boar fan 2 doesnt stop just beam him again
Were not doing it
Hunt doesnt reuse stuff
And pleg despawns after 70 blocks
Ye me too
Ive been through those lists so many times alrdy
Thats y i believe we need trigger
What if it isnt retesting
What if were missing a step
And norhing will work until we conplete it
Boar fan 2 is blackmailing me to return if i dont give him recombed legion v necron 💀
Anyways lets go retest everything
Also try to test the full 2nd jacob list again
Did we try the full 2nd jacob list
What if some1 said they tested smth
But they didnt
Same reason as the guy who mined the sulphur blocks
Just ppl being mean
Ye ik
But what if some1 trolled
And it wasnt some1 dedicated
If were almost 2 weeks behin in this hunt
Just cuz some1 listed smth they didnt test
Im gonna...
Time to go through all the tested ideas ig
Suggestions and tested are surprisingly empty
Nothing in the jacob timeframe btw
:nop:
Nop
:feelsbadman:
ok whats happened in the last 12 hours
what did we test on plegs?
yoink is the hint npc for loremaster
I GOT MAGGIE OUT OF ITS ROOM
maggie tp'd to its room
proof
oh ye those 2 guys
what purpose do they serve?
??
btw where is maggie's owner
maggie's owner mentioned that ppl keep taking maggie away but maggie always comes back
how long does it take to lvl up an epic snail with experiments (not off topic cuz loremaster)
i love the fact i can lvl up my snail and lvl up my hotm at once
do i talk abt 5m magma and 5m netherrack setup here or #general
does godpot help with achieveing max mining fortune on snail
if i alrdy have 400 speed
how much mp do i need for 200k netherrack an hour
is 750 enough
does leg and epic snail make a difference for netherrack
should i recomb my netherrack gear for 4 extra speed
how much time would it save
btw how do i make netherrack mining less boring to myself
is it cheating if i mine with moving my mouse and shit, but looking at tv
too much of that to see all of it in 25 hours tho
also is it worth afking magmas with only 16 minons
is it worth buying x655 for netherrack
time to put down magmacube minions (suffering)
wat pickaxe
do i use diamond spreading on magmas
wats the full setup for magma minis
me has 61m rn
i cant buy flycatchers
does corrupt soil help
so no dia spreading?
i wont be using flycatchers
breh i just put a shelmet on my gdrag so i can peacefully put on magma cube minis
and i forgor i had relic on
- 50m
does afking help minion speed
i dont regret destroying my minos relic
magma cube setup fully done in 15 mins
when i was doing tara setup with no shelmet
it took 7 hours
i forgot
i thought it still had antique remedies
i got the relic ystrdy
any new developments in the hunt?
i got my friend to fish for me to test sulphur block
what do we splash plheg with so it doesnt die
r there fishing parties rn
SULPHUR BLOCK LOBBY AT PLHLEG POOL IF ANY1 IS CRAZY ENOUGH TO TEST IT
wanna start fishing party
my friend alrdy fishing
SULPHUR BLOCK THEORY DEBUNKED
100% DEBUNKED
NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN
yes
jacob was almost sure we would solve on 1st fishing party and was there all the time. there was no sulohur block there
no
i just figured out
its debunked
y did jacob appear
on 1st party
there was no sulphur block
he said if we dont solve it by when he wakes up were officialy not nerds
the conditon and trigger
were possible in that lobby
lets just retest stuff
makes most sense
this guy just queues us for kuudra
most likely we were just about to solve believer on 1st fishing party, even jacob came there
that lobby met all conditions
did any1 record that stuff
can he send us the footage?
lets retest everything from then
what if we have to right-click with buckets in a specific order?
lets make fishing party please
what should i put in hotm for netherrack mining
elle
sadge 😦
just pickobolus)
?
should i just put into mining xp perk so i get xp when i suffer
upgrade peak of the mountain?
its lvl 1 for me rn
y doesnt pickobolus work with pioneer pickaxe
also wat pickaxe for netherrack
and is it dumb to use a lvl 65 snail
how much collat do i need
best spot for netherrack mining?
oh i was mining there alrdy
also y no lvl 100 epic snails on ah 😦
how do i make smth to remind me exactly every 30 secs to use rogue sword
fishing party today?
ok ig
make a kuudra gatekeeper party
y tf doesnt pickobolus work on netherrack
no w8
it does
but not with pioneer pickaxe
what pickaxe is the best for netherrack mining
wats best
i cant use pickobolus with it
u mine netherrack rn
which pickaxe u use
how much for a lvl 100 epic snail
or should i put candy on it
none on ah tho
how much does epic snail need in candy to be lvl 100
how much xp is an epic pet from lvl 65 to lvl 100
17.2m xp for an epic???
isnt a legendary 24m in total
where can i buy lvl 100 epic (0 on ah)
wtf do they appear as
does any1 here have lvl 100 epic snail (none on ah)
he's beamed...
lets make a fishing party to retest stuff
when fishing party
me when no fishing party:
fishing party?
pig's bucket idea
i will do everything for a fishing party
r we doin a fishin party within the next 5 days
what is chance of fishing party today
guys we have to vote boarry for fishing party sooner!!!1!!11!11!1111
Barry's half-brother thats half boar
maybe say "The Kuudra is coming" after fishing a plhleg up?
oh no ping
srry pig
fishing party when
fishing 24
i cant get plheg
cuz too low lvl fishing
its 1/1000 to replace a scc
and u can only get the scc at fishing 27
any1 here selling lvl 100 epic snail (0 on ah)
3242834928349823th time of asking for fishing party
ye im in italy rn
it is 5 am
ok if we dont fish for plhleg
lets go do arch
lets do arch, we alrdy have the ember armor part
wat is fake?
how should we do arch
but u literally said no1 will fish
test pig's bucket idea
do we even have any ideas?
keep in mind
that the lobby from 1st fishing party met all conditions
and we almost solved it
PogoChicken?
y was jacob there then. everything was pointing to us solving it
*chicken noises
then we need a trigger
like the 4k mana book
problem is, theres no hint npc that we know of
no dialogue hinting at anything
even if there isnt a hint npc, there is probably some trigger
ummmm wat if mandible isnt related to hunt🤓
ok lets talk about the mandible now
Its mandiblin' time 😎
also fishing party?
ikr
its horrible here
nah
but im on vacation in italy
every second is pain
ye im talking about the weather
im rlly like italy
:SKull:
💀
y is sulphur evolution in the 36h timespan 💀
hehe the 36h period thing is me talking abt BOAR
but i did mention pig's idea
should we retest?
i think we have enough reasons to make a fishing party soon
pig u gonna join or fish by urself again?
jacob will prob give leads when we do believer
like with loremaster and believer
dw
w8
im not sure we tried sulphur coal
so the sulphur block thing, no matter how stupid it is
matches the timeframe
imma go find us a lobby for it
me and friend will guard
i think we should retest stuff first
but it matches the timeframe
otherwise i completely forgot abt it
its just a right click
fishing party?
me when sulphur block lobby and game crashes 2 mins after:
we tried it, but some1 mines b4 we got a plhleg
the idea is stupid
im only talkign abt it cuz it was in the 36h timespan
SULPHUR BLOCK PING
3 SULPHUR BLOCKS IN PLHLEG RADIUS
PERFECT LOBBY
some1 mines them all
if its actually sulphur block imma be so mad
cuz it can be griefed so easily
lets all collectively forget abt the sulphur block
i stopped  bringing it up
only mentioned cuz 36h timespan
yes
tysm ive been waiting for this footage for so long
me in like 10 mins
wait if jacob said some1 bringed it alrdy
does the piece alrdy exist?
ok
pogo needs 1st piece lol
LET. IT DIE. FORGET. ABOUT. IT.
i found like 7 lobbies all mined
even when i gave some1 3m to not mine it
i dont think admins would do this to us
slayers arent grieafable (Anymore)
ik ur jk
not funny
we should retest ideas
better than sulphur block tho
almost every1 likes them wtf
ok poll time
VOTE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1. retesting ideas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. the stupid sulphur block thing
ik we shouldnt ban ideas but
i rlly dont think we should test sulphur block
i dont think admins would make smth thats griefable
the furry clothes you will wear should be a boar
FORGET IT
My irl name is Dr. Boarchel Boarbius
1. very dumb 2. in hunt ideas
lets try a viking ritual on believer
the fish in the furnace should be plhlegblast
but wat would be furnace
i did that ystrdy
ok so
believer is viking
and wants to be reminded of kuudra
so we show him plhleg
ye ik
but we have to imply its kuudra
even if it isnt
if its a minor chat infraction
y can u get muted for it
wtf
i gave viking a gold sulphur skitter and...
Ooh! That looks exotic!
It wasn't quite what I was looking for but I'll take it thanks!
and i got achievement
i used gold not dia
omfg
those nons
that griefed
jacob
ok sulphur evo debunked now no1 ever mention it again
w8 since its debunked can we ban it?
wait coffee
isnt there some cofee in mage bar?
jacob typing :monkaS:
ok so we literally have nothing now
great 👍
o7
what do we do now?
jacob can you say sulphur evolution is officially debunked?
beam moment
our full progress for believer just got reset 👍
i have no motivation to join fishing party
and i was waiting so long for one
he alrdy left
HMMMMMMMMMMMM
best idea, cuz its the only 1 we have
get hyp and u 1 shot everything (if u can afford)
jungleboar
3m is enough
for aurora and aurora staff
that deals like 300k a hit i think
JacobRuby is typing :monkaS:
oh god
💀
i am frickin leaving the hunt for 28324 years (when believer gets solved)
i just want jacob to say sulphur evo isnt real
thats all i want
jacob pls say sulphur evo makes no sense and isnt real thanks
this is our last hope
is there even a plhleg party rn
W8 JACOB CONFIRMED SULPHUR BLOCK ISNT REAL
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
is every viking related thing fully debunked
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
wat u even trynna do with phlegs now?
jacob say sulphur evolution is dumb and debunked
what r we even doing
wats our idea for plhleg now
plhlegblast moment
ok wat do we do on next squid
☠️  Weslay was killed by Weslay.
what will we test on plegs
wat did we try on last 2
i give up, all our theories just got destroyed
do we even have anything to test on squid
the fishing party is dying help
stop saying that
should we go do arch instead
the only thing we know in like 1 month
is plhleg is connected
ok so what should we do for arch
fishing party died
solution for believer is prob extremely simple
what if we're overcomplicating it
did u guys retest stuff in fishing party
when next fishing party
guys pls fishing party
plhlegblast is kuudra but needs sulphur 💀
remove
but keep skitter
skitter makes sense
glitched fire eel
fishing party?
fishing party when
we kinda did
wats our idea rn
y we talking abt rift its prob not related to mandible
move to off topic so we can have quality mandible discussion
Ummmmm do we even know if mandible is related to the hunt? 🤓 🤓 🤓
what is it
💀
u good?
wot
jacob literally said it does
if squid isnt part of the hunt i will buy a boar fursuit
no, boar
BEAMED 😠
this clown doesnt know what boar is
WE HAVE A BAOR CHANNEL
r u a troll
jacob debunked 99% of all our theories
fishing party?
k
wats a gud setup for fishing 27
infinite budget
im fishing 24 rn
i cant use slug yet
i meant to get to 27
k
no cuz i dont wanna get /ignore added by everyone so i cant join fishing parties 🙂
1. y? 2. my profile is too trash and im embarrassed of it
JAWBUSSY
guys the pack magma cube from the fishing party lobby is still in the plheg pool
do i put it out of its misery?
You died and lost 11,210,901 coins!
to the magma
i will now proceed to brutally murder it with hyp
i had for like 4 months
but when i was offline
it ran out
but i can make the 11m back in 30 mins
anyways, the magma is DEAD
i will now get 5m magma cream collection (real and very incredible)
is there a fishing party rn?
so we have no ideas again?
i wanna do arch
we havent figured out anything except plhelg + believer in the last month or so
?
k
??
do we have any ideas yet
fishing party? (this is now my line)
lmfao
ok but is there one rn?
who is? whats their ign?
whenever there is fishing party
ping me
just ping me bruh i wanna test stuff on plhleg
does it hurt you to ping me
its mandiblin' time
+ crown of greed + 1b bank gdrag too, since epoa tested it
what is plhleg is kuudra but needs to grow up
what if there is another way to make plhleg into kuudra than sulphur?
even tho its 99% not related to current step
plheg is 99.99999% kuudra
ok but how do we connect buckets to believer?
how does buckets conenct to believer
its most likely buckets
just connect it to believer
how can we connect buckets to believer
3428424825th time of asking how tf do buckets connect to believer
ye ik
buckets most likely solution
but how do we connect it to believer
what if we need 15m iron collection (like 5m netherrack and 5m magma) (5m x 3)? and no im not joking i just have no other ideas
what if we have to click it with all buckets in a specific order?
when i tested all buckets
i didnt test ench lava/magma/plasma/everburning flame
fishing party reason achieved
its an upgrade for a bucket
boar in a bucket?
w8 make that in boarpire
i cant do netherrack cuz no lvl 100 epic snail ever on ah 💀
when
mining with 100 speed is impossible
pet candy is so cringe
imma just buy a leg one
last time i checked was 22m
EPIC ONE 17.5M ON AH
OMFG
w8 im fishing 24
whats the upgrade
what armor/rod?
320 mining fortune with snail
is that ok?
i just started mining and found duggy lmfao
ive been mining netherrack for 5 mins and its so frickin boring and seemed like 45 mins
imma just not do it
does efficient miner work on it
10 mins of mining netherrack
IT IS PAIN
imma do 100k a day at most
wait why are we voting barry
6 perks?
fishing party?
fishing party when
did we try feeding plhlegblast a sulphur skitter
was everything about a viking ritual deconfirmed
y slug boots
what jacob said is 100% unrelated to hunt
we have to remind believer of kuudra
through plhleg
if its reverse viking
its prob that
yes
read sulphur evolution in ideas 👍
i was jk
the theory is a meme
also it wasnt debunked
sulphur block was
the step for mandible prob has to do smth with it
sulphur evo doesnt equal sulphur block. sulphur evo not on any list cuz its a meme
u cant get any of those souls
sulphur evo on pig's list as hmmm (green color) 💀
can we now talk abt mandible and not barry
any ideas for plhleg?
how do we turn plhleg into kuudra
how to turn plhleg to kuudra without sulphur
lets debunk plhleg turning into kuudra too
?
look im fishing for 27 rn, but i get less than like 100k xp an hour
What happened in the last 20 hours
Also was sulphur evolution tested and debunked?
What happened in the last 20h
Did anything happen in the last 20 hours
Breh
Did we debunk sulphur evo alrdy? (Sulphur evo isnt sulphur block idea)
im at 400 rn how fast am i gonna get in
according to jacob appearing when plhleg and his iconic line, all obbies prob met the conidtion to solving it and we were prob pretty close
even if the 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 chance that brayden is related to anything in the hunt, its not related to believer
if brayden is related to believer i will buy a boar fursuit (real and very incredible)
idk
if they dont i will make one
deleted
oh no
pls dont confirm it
just forget what i said
there will be no confirmation cuz brayden not related to hunt
and thats y i wont buy the boar fursuit
Any ideas for funny squid?
The lab prob not related to hunt
Y r there so many frickin iron golem heads in aura's lab
I asked jacob to say a smth and he replied with no last fishing party 💀
Its prob doing kuudra with full kuudra follower or smth since he and 2 kuudra guys at gate mention we dont deal with kuudra correctly
On alpha theres a new npc there and dialogue is 2 - 3 business days
We should make a fishing party for retesting old ideas that werent debunked
When fishing party, we gotta retest old stuff or retest slightly different cuz jacob line prob means that we have right idea, but just gotta execute it a bit differently
What is currently confirmed or hinted at for believer
Ye but do we have any idea to connect believer and plhleg or any hints for it
For legs we had to find a RELIC for a kuudra ARCHEOLOGIST. For boots we had to trigger the kuudra fight line which could be considered kuudra LORE for LOREMASTER. But how do we show believer we believe in kuudra?
What if we gotta show believer that we believe in kuudra by somehow convincing him that plhleg is kuudra? (Im not saying it is tho)
We havent done those yet, and were focusing on believer rn
I think its convincing believer plhleg is kuudra
Maybe somehow putting it in lava without it dying
Maybe giving it a lava talisman?
Its not keeping it alive
Its about making it resistant to lava
Kuudra doesnt regen constantly to live in lava
Its resistant to it
Have we tried obsidian skin pot effect on pleggy
Its an effect
That gives lava res in volcano iirc
From hot chocolate bought from Ezekiel
Perfect timing 💀
We have to make plhleg appear as kuudra to believer
Ik this idea is dumb but...
Should we try to splash believer with blindness so he doesnt see plhleg well enough?
When pleggy alive?
Try when alive
Cuz the point is believer seeing
That Plhlegblast is Kuudra cuz he doesnt see well
Posted idea for plhleg
clockseller alrdy tested it
I will use my -23 braincells to come up with like 10 ideas that will make sense, just so some1 will make a fishing party
Ye
Fishing party in 6 hours
I will make it in 6 hours
That y
I made idea
Also we should focus on retesting but with a slight change like sea emp to jake was soul sea emp to jake
In a bucket
Nothing
I think its making plhleg appear like its kuudra
So believer believes its actually kuudra
No splash believer with blindness during Plhlegblast being alive
Ye but u need seasoned
Ye
U need 10k i think
10k xp
Do /rank in #bot-commands
I make fishing party in 6 hours
Same
Any1 have any ideas
💀
Ok listen to this
My crazy conspiracy theory aunt
Said the purpose of the hunt is for us to spend a ton of time on out phones and that tech companies are sponsoring this to brainwash us 💀
Were talking about the woman who thinks vaccines have microchips that control your brain for some new world order in 2030 💀 💀 💀
Anyways back to mandible
Any1 have ideas for connecting funny squid with believer
I have one in hunt ideas
I drank godpot in front of it
How do we make plhleg lava resistant
It most likely refers to the fact that bringing a sea emp to jake was listed as a tested idea that didnt work, and bringing a necromancy sea emp soul to jake was the solution
Most of the lists were debunked by jacob alrdy
Pigicial made a list of stuff debunked and not, check pins
Is it a bad time to talk abt sulphur evolution seriously (sulphur evolution isnt related to sulphur block idea)
And sulphur evo isnt debunked, sulphur block is
???
Sulphur evolution isnt giving plhleg sulphur tho
Make it not die
So sulphur evo could tie into all this...
What if we have to show to believer that plhleg is kuudra
Without turning it into kuudra
It isnt feeding sulphur
Its debunked
But sulphur evo wasnt
I think we must find a connection between kuudra and plhleg
So believer sees we believe in kuudra
If i type the whole theory here
Im getting permabanned
Just
Go to pigicial's site in pins and go to Plhlegblast is Kuudra but he needs sulphur
And read from there
Ye sadly thats it
Plhleg was either a kuudra that detransformed after not eating sulphur for a long time or is yet to transform into kuudra
Although feeding it sulphur is debunked
SULPHUR EVO DEBUNKED LETS GOOOOOO
IF IT WOULDNT GET ME PERMABANNED I WOULD PING EVERYONE
IT IS TIME OF CELEBRATION
MY OTHER THEORIES BEIN CONFIRMED RN
I KNEW IT
I KNEW THAT ALL LOBBIES MET THE CONDITIONS
THIS IS A HUGE STEP
jacob typing :monkaS:
@FuriouslyFast42 SORRY FOR PING BUT SULPHUR EVO DEBUNKED BY JACOB
Jacob give a small hint pls
Sad
SULPHUR EVO DEBUNKED GUYS
JACOB SAID
im Just so happy
Is that a freaking hint
Cuz everburning flame
Jacob is the number the final step
We should make a jacob ping for whenever jacob starts talking
I posted idea in Hunt ideas
We have that
Is jacob still here
I have idea
I posted in Hunt ideas
I CANT WAIT for the moment
When we figure it out
And it turns out it was so simple
The c
THE C MEANS...
csulphur evolution
The c stands for csulphur evolution
It isnt debunked now
Hmmmmmmm
cbrining plhleg to sulphur block?
Jacob say one more letter please
The c obviously stands for csulphur evolution smh my head
Arch is chestplate, not beleiever
Convince me otherwise
Pleggy
What is c is unrelated
Jacob is sulphur evolution fully debunked?
Its prob not a condition
Since jacob said he expected us to get during fishing parties
This is sad
I have no purpose anymore
Now that sulphur evo ded
Mogus soup?
what
Jacob what is it
Do it
@Deleted User
@Deleted User win this
@Deleted User BEST AT CHESS
What if we have a chess ai go against him
What should i do now
That sulphur evo ded
My life's research... Debunked
I meant sulphur block this time lol
They were NEVER related bruh
Just get a chess ai to beat jacob
Simple as that
No fishing party until chess?
What could the second letter be
I kinda suck at chess tho
Does jacob play chess a lot?
vc?
This is just for a letter
We should also focus on ideas and testing them
Does the game being chess
A hint for mandible
@Deleted User I SUMMON YOU
What if the game being chess is a hint for believer?
Is there chess in sb
💀
I like the idea of chess tourney, but will there be time for plhleg fishing
Jacob will u give 3rd letter for another challenge?
@Deleted User we need u for this
I am on boat rn
Even the aurocorrect said boar...
When r we doin it
Today?
Last time I played chess is when i was like 9
Will Jacob give another letter for a different challenge
Is there chess in sb
Maybe chess is a hint
Why is carpet a condition
I solved it
Copium cuz sulphur evolution
Its copium
Cuz he debunked sulphur evo
Jacob's description is amogus letter, amogus letter is at the end of suspicious stew description
Sulphur evolution is still standing strong
C is for coal and sulphuric coal exists give it to plhleg and believer solved
What if its crimson isle
If Jacob is trolling we have no hope of ever solving it
Jacob prob trolling lets go back to retesting stuff :feelsbadman:
Ye, c stands for csulphur evolution
Jacob please i hope ur not trolling  this letter is out only hope
Jacob prob not here anymore
I always get excited when Jacob comes then he debunks everything and i feel empty
What is this whole thing is an experiment by jacob so he sees how far we go for a jaw of a lava kraken in a block game
This whole thing is sad and hopeless
I have idea in Hunt ideas
Sad
Its Chessin' time?
I hope Jacob gives us a condition for a third letter
15 days since 1st fishing party :feelsbadman:
This is hopeless
This chess tourney is our final hope
Unless Jacob trolling
Remember
Jacob said no sea emp in last 5 days
C
Of C
Guys
What is the c is Cowshed
And one of their crazy ideas is the solution
Do i have to speak to join chess thing
Or just screenshare
Its cowshed
And their ideas are the solution
Ye thats y we should also keep focusing on fishing parties
Jacob will u give 3rd letter too
Jacob will there be a 3rd letter or no
Me
Ik its a joke but say it
Ok
Send footage
PLHLEGBLAST TO ODGER OMG11!1!1!1!1!!!!!
Wait that makes sense
C standing for corrupted
I wasnt talking abt ur shitpost
What if the condition is
Plhleg being corrupted
Ik
But were all corrupted?
If ur fishing 27
Their ign is amcneil
Hmm
Is that technically cheating?
What happened in last 16 hours
Ye ik
I was there sadly
Whats the last thing Jacob said
@Deleted User I summon thee
@Deleted User
You will help us win the chess tourney
I give u hyp if u play it
Learn
Do you want my hyp or no
@Deleted User
I give u the hyp term and gdrag
So u can get all u want
The 2.6b u want
Y
Pls play chess
Ok then
Just let me make my boars
And u make ur boars
Bruh i need more i have 60m rn
OK u dont need to play, just dont make a fire boar and bucket boar
Make OTHER boars
Mandiblin' time ig
Ratio
Still ratio
Guys what if the c is cowshed
And one of their crazy stupid ideas is solution
Nah, c is 100% Cowshed
What Jacob hint
Oops ping
What should I do now that sulphur evolution is dead
That is my entire personality tho
So whats our idea rn
What if the c is for cloak
And we need a cloak
Is 1b bank gdrag debunked
Lets collectively forget about sulphur blocks
sulphur evo is in hmm
ITS NOT DED
SULPHUR EVOLUTION
Sulphur evo isnt sulphur block idea tho
This is sulphur evolution tho
But Jacob directly debunked it to me ystrdy
Idk
Its a meme
Anyways
Capturing plhleg soul without necromancy is interesting
It could be just convincing believer that kuudra is plhleg but lets all forget it cuz its debunked
Fishing party? (More iconic that jacob's line)
Ok lets test soul whip on plhleg
Or smth soul related that isnt necromancy
Yes
Souls Rebound and Soul Whip
Try on plhleg
W8
Soul eater
Kill kuudra mob with soul eater
Dont use it until attacking plhleg
Should i do a funny and donate 1b
1.5b?
Maybe it will
I think the final number to donate is gonna be around 500m
It prob wont be less than 250m
Was making plhleg appear as kuudra so believer thinks its kuudra although it isnt kuudra debunked
I will kill a kuudra follower with a souls rebound with soul eater 5 and hit plhleg with it
You can have my hyp
Explain the entire cake soul theory in extreme detail
Lets do it
Fishing party now!
Btw
Is there a way to see how many times i said fishing party in this server
Jacob said aplha stuff not related to hunt
Yes
No
Lets try killing a kuudra follower mob with souls rebound that has soul eater 5 then hitting plhleg with it and clicking it with all cake soul variants
But related to souls
Is alchemist staff fully debunked
Not related to hunt and since nether update
Related 100% confirmed by jacob
Oh ye
How r we gonna solve arch
We only have 1 thing for arch rn
Can we do believer b4 august
That was for archeologist
Prob not cuz u can only get it once (unless u swap factions) and most ppl sold it alrdy
Ye for 250k
Also if/when Jacob comes online ask him for Arch clues
Me too
Yay
ITS FISHIN' TIME
Should i try doing 1.5b when plhleg alive cuz its corrupted plhleg's health
No c is csulphur evolution
U CANT use necromancy on it
OMFG
BEZOS
Its an item
Dropped from Bezals
TRY BEZOS
Bezos not there tho
Oh u meant @Deleted User
Im dumb
Ye cuz it was weird to include it
Y would they name it bezos
Hmmm
Its not sulphur
Jacob confirmed
Did he update it
CAKE SOUL IT
Right click with cake soul
Wtf
Wtf is that emoji
Did we cake soul it
It appeared on screen
Then i clickee it
Clicked
Jacob say a single number thats a hint and not the number for believer
Thank you jacob
Fiesta fishing party i donated smth smth 48m that was just random
Is there a list of everything Jacob ever said
Did we try throwing a barb duke x soul into volcano (lasea dialogue)
Hot kuudra days gibberish
Its moving like the recomb symbols
Try it
Some1 do a hot kuudra rn
And trnaslate
Y r there 2 penguins
What if some1 here is Jacob disguised to give us hints
Sulphur Evolution is the only solution
Ok now back to mandible
What if the c isnt an item
i said it many more times tho
What if c is chaos_filler
Corm is for Arch, change my mind
Thirty exposed slime minis today btw 💀
Amogus
What if c is crimson
Gib us shitpost channel please
I would do everything for a shitpost channel
W8 advertising magma minis is allowed here?
Yay
I can sell em
We got a plhleg and @Deleted User found a (real) npc confiriming sulphur evolution
Duggy
Please
Give shitposts channel
Me getting beamed moment
Who can make em
Also can I post a meme abt sulphur evo without beam please in #general
I found smth very strange
There is rampart's quarry in dwarven mines
But also Rampart Armor in crimson isle
I am wearing Rampart Armor to next plhleg
Also is it confirmed
That all steps of hunt on crimson isle
W8
We had to find
Ok
Im not even gonna type my essay abt old blazing
Rampart Armor name isnt a coincidence
Prvs steps related to mining
Legs divan's
Boots netherrack and old blazing via deep caverns
So maybe Rampart here cuz its an area in dwarven
Try rampart
Name CANT be coincidence
Boar is a clue
Also
Did we sacrifice barb duke x soul to volcano
Ever
I am #5 in barb dukes
I will get a soul in no time
Can we beat him
@Deleted User I summon thee to defeat Jacob
@Deleted User morb all over the game with jacob
OMFG ROFL SO ORIGINAL SO FUNNY I LOVE THIS IDEA
R any of u guys training chess rn
Aqua
Wanna do a match of chess on chess.com @Deleted User
Make it
And u get my hyp
Im Boar_In_A_Bucket
Did we try using fire freeze on plhleg
Me and friend love fishing on the bridge without armor and having friend with hyp protect us
epoa since u do kuudra
Get souls rebound with soul eater 5 and kill a kuudra follower with it and hit plhleg with it once (dont hit anything after killing follower except plhleg) then donate the dmg
Whats our best idea rn
@Deleted User wanna play chess today for my hyp?
Whats our best idea for believer rn :feelsbadman:
Any progress yet?
Gl guys
Did we get the letter
What is it
Crimson Isle?
I checked announcements, whats the bigger lead?
Its cSulphur iEvolution (dont beam me i will stop)
Omfg
Chickzilla is one of the main supporting factors for sulphur evolution
Like rlly
The actual theory not the meme
What is the bigger hint Jacob gave i literally see nothing else than the C I, no linked mssgs
Some guy in dragoon's server saying kuudra mandible reforge is bad???
It links me to fricking this
The link in pins
It linked me to smth different now
Can u just tell me the link, its showing me smth different now
What is the bigger hint the link is showing me smth different
I wouldnt be surprised
What if each step gets more difficult
Arch will be literally impossible then
Ok imma do it
Im so tired of all this i hope its intenger and that its done for then
Should i donate intenger limit ({C}oin {I}ntenger) so all this is done (also empty purse hint)
Ye imma try it during plhleg
OMFG
I CRACKED IT
It is...
Cowshed's Ideas
Check all Cowshed Ideas
W8
I will
Just incase
:feelsbadman:
I need a therapist
I cant read those ideas anymore
Like y tf do they even mention them
Im losing my sanity reading em
THIS IS TORTURE
Does Cowshed have mods on their server
Cuz those ideas...
*copium
Drakuu is 99.999% the final step after full kuudra follower set. It makes sense
Guys
C I is...
Copium Inhaler
We need to get one so we dont give up
(and very incredible)
Also remember
C I is a hint not solution
So if we get a gud idea
Dont disregard it if it isnt related to C and I
What is the other hint Jacob gave
Fishing party?
Should I tell the sulphur evo theory in Cowshed for funny moment
Corm is most likely for arch
None of his dialogue is related to beleiver
If we solve this b4 the end of july...
@Deleted User gets all my stuff
U have to say "real and very incredible"
In a situation like this
No
My idiot friend
Who begs me for my hyp
All the time
C I is only a hint
If we get a very gud idea we shouldnt disregard it if it isnt related to C I
I said that b4 i said what u quoted...
💀
Chickzilla is a major supporting factor of Sulphur Evolution
Who we talking about?
Y we talking about some random person
And not mandible 💀
This thought process happens to me every day 💀
Time to go over all items :feelsbadman:
Yes
It is great and true
IT ALWAYS WAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE
no abilities that r C and I yet :feelsbadman:
Is there a list of all abilites in the game
If we solve this b4 the end of july, @Deleted User gets my hyp, term, gdrag, necron and storm
I'll do you one better
If we dont solve this by the end of july i will buy a boar fursuit and wear it for 12 hours
I have faith we will solve this soon
So dw
I wont be buying the boar fursuit
Now
DO FISHING PARTY
Whats the chance we solve this be july ends
If we ever solve believer @Deleted User gets my hyp, term, gdrag, necron and storm
Solution found
Ofc
Bladesoul and Barbarian Duke X
I have max bestiary for bladesoul
And 2 times over max bestiary for duke
Like plhlegblast became addicted to sulphur and turned into kuudra
See, it makes sense :yep: :yep: :yep:
It was said
Kuudra ate too much sulphur
And like barbs turn into pigs when they dont eat sulphur for long
A kuudra not eating sulphur for centuries
Turns it back into plhlegblast
:yep:
Im inhaling copium, not smoking weed
No
Sulphur Evolution makes sense, but Jacob debunked Sulphur Evolution directly
Wot
No
Forget it
Jacob said it isnt real
I was talking abt sulphur evo
And Jacob said
That we havent gotten to next step yet
SO STOP TALKING ABT SULPHUR EVO UNLESS U TALKING ABT IT LIKE A MEME
Jacob debunked it
I was talking abt it
Then he said we not at next step yet
it is DEBUNKED
but lives on as a meme in #general
Ok now back to mandible so i dont get beamed
#general
Ok fishing party
What ideas we got
Tried iirc
Kuduraa Manidibil
no mods here so...
The C and I r
cSulphur iEvolution
Real and very incredible
Put this in #general or duggy beams us
Arent u beamed?
Have you heard of the Sulphur Evolution
What if its C I A and Jacob's hints r subliminal mssgs to mind control us 🐗 🤯
We r never solving this :feelsbadman:
Oh shit
The Jacob pinger might be right
What if we have to cure it from it dying to lava
Can we now move the sulphur evo shitposts to #general pls?
move to off topic with the shitposts
Can we now talk abt the fucking mandible now
Ppl r shitposting
#general
Also ye
We need that
Aura is not Hunt 100%
Yes
INTO KUUDRA
#sulphurevo
i
But w8
That Jacob hint
Rlly points towards sulphur evo
Although
Jacob himself stated sulphur evo is debunked
Sus
When mods come online im so beamed
Ok so a new theory
What if we have to make plhleg not die to lava
So believer thinks its kuudra
It does
What r u on?
Sulphur?
Lava kills it
Bruh
Every1 can confirm
IT GETS DMGED BY LAVA
Omg
If we ever solve this im buying a boar fursuit
Jacob gave us so many hints yet we have nothing except believer + plhleg
Thats my line
Make plhleg shoot out ink
Tease it with smth
Tease the squid with kismet feather
Guys make fishing party cuz im boared
Jacob's hints r subliminal mssgs for CIA to control us 🐗 🤯
What if C I isnt an item
Fishing party? (Im boared)
Imma try intenger limit cuz C for Coin and I for Intenger
Also another thing is killing a kuudra follower with souls rebound with soul eater 5 not hitting anything except plhleg and donating dmg
To capture its soul without NECrOMAncY
Ik we corrupted every plhleg...
But what if C I is Corrupt It
Hangman for hint
Y ping :(
Beam him
I Just hope it doesnt get added as an emoji
Beam (real)
Ok can we now go back to funny lava kraken jaw please
#general
Stop shitposting
Move to #general
Thats y we cant get the mandible
Mods beam off topic stuff here
Ye ik
But sometimes we can have quality mandible discussion
C I r only initials of a hint
A hint
Were wasting time kinda
Although chess was fun
Beg Jacob to give us a new challenge for another letter
Clockseller ur a mod right?
Beam stuff that arent on topic this is chaos
Ppl were spamming Jacob ping ss's b4
W8 since divan is kinda expensive...
Could gdrag 1b bank be involved
Wat
Y
???
Wot
Sadge
I also pinged a ton of ppl to redirect them to #general when they were shitposting and didnt get mute
No
Did we analyze believer saying kuudra blessed this lavapool?
kooder 👍
What if plhlegs r some kinda of minions of kuudra
Beam
U-
Ok back to kooder's mandibil
Maybe plhlegs
Are a projection
Of kuudra
Some1 alrdy said that in #general iirc
Epoa
Did u kill plhleg with alchemist when whole hunt was locked by relic and did u use crown of greed and lvl 200 1b bank gdrag
Epoa
epoa anwser me
*@feelfreetomakeityourself!
#general
Now back to mandible
What if C I is
Catch Inferno
Lets catch it with inferno rod
Every1 use inferno rod
Ik i said make cuz bearded Said make
#general get beamed
Can we talk abt mandible not morbius begging for my hyp?
There is an item called Mandraa (kuudra + mandible?) and has the same symbol as 2 kuudra guys at gate
Unreleased tho, u get from burning kuudra
Yes
Go to skyblock wiki and search mandraa
Stop begging
Go to off topic to beg
Do we have ideas for fishing party
My friend just bid 4.2m on my golden nugget on ah lol
Yes, and sponge there is mineable netherrack
Jacob said its a hint
He never said solution
Beam them now
Beam moment
C is condition then
Arch
Lets do arch
Zulu
The test it urself guy said the moving gibberish can translate into raw text
Translate what kuudra says
In hot kuudra
Whats our idea rn
Should we restest stuff
Cuz Jacob believed we would finish during 1st parties
We were close
SEASONED ROLE @ every1
Third ever seasoned role lets gooooo
I am superior to every1 cuz i have seasoned
(real)
No
I dont wanna leak my ign
Im embarassed of my profile
beamed from official sulphur evo server
me too
we gotta make it lava res and say "This one is Angry/Mana Hungry/Speedy!"
but how do we make it lava res tho
wat was ur nw and skill avrg and playtime
me too
i always secretly join parties
just approximately
im 24 rn
imma grind
playtime and skill avrg also without cosmetics nw?
just approximately
is there any chance we could get a third letter
wait
what if we have to catch the plhlegblast alrdy corrupted?
with corruption enchant
Corruption I
w8 no
whatever the solution is
it could be achieved in all prvs fishing parties
since jacob said he expected us to get it
whatever it is its achievable in all lobbies he's been in
i think we should retest stuff
last time i said it was ystrdy
is there a fishing party?
admins saved my life
intenger limit was 2.1b now its 10b
they changed it
so its not part of hunt
so could intenger limit still be for believer?
or no
divan is funny bullshit req tho. they couldve made it x655 but ig the breaking power 10 and cataclysmic weakening the rock makes sense
so we should show believer that we believe
i think THE theory might play a part in obtaining the mandible
nah
wouldnt make sense
all parts of the hunt require hunting
sulphur evo makes sense for mandible, but not believer
mandible last step
start fishing party
gm, also great timing
pig wanna do fishing party
ik i say it too much, but
fishing party?
not that cuz jacob was expecting us to get it in all lobbies he was in
will there be a fishing party today
gl with believer, cya in around a month
Since Plhlegblast is bigger than potatoes, maybe also try enchanted bone block (it exists) on plhleg
Selling a ton of enchanted wool cuz u need 20 stacks for next step
1m per enchanted wool btw
C I could also mean capture ink
What if we had to make the plhleg shoot out ink and put the ink in a bucket?
Since Plhleg drops 30 Ink Sacks, should I grind to fishing 27, fish 2 plhleg (ik it takes 20h per) and craft an Ink Wand with it. Then catch another Plhleg and kill it with the plhleg Ink Sack Ink Wand
Or is that too much effort for smth not confirmed
C = craft, I = Ink/Ink Wand
I think the netherrack is kinda mean i only get 250k an hour thats 20 hours
Ye but its so boring...
10 mins of netherrack is like an hour of doing other stuff
Also i only get 250k an hour if i rlly rlly focus a lot
With emerald ring u can make a bil in 16m hours 🐗 🤯
Its Ink Bomb
Not Cast Ink
Wasnt that meant to be for amber crystal but then changed to the quest goblin king gives?
C I is Just a hint and not necessarily an item
#general
Under what condition will we do a fishing party
Somehow making plhleg resistant from lava without pots, blinding believer with blindness pots, killing 2 plhlegs and crafting Ink Wand with only their ink and and then hitting plhleg and last shotting it with the wand
I'll try the 3rd one myself when marina and i get fishing 27
PlHLlEGLAHBLAST
WHAT DID U TEST ON IT
Next time
Blind believer with Max lvl blindness
And try to make plhleg lava resistant somehow
Nah i only do that in #general now
I originaly suggested blindness on believer
Im almost 90% I is Ink, although C could be a variety of things
I suggested blindness pots b4 C I
I tried ice spray but imma try this too
Also did we do gyro
Maybe we gotta turn plhleg into calamari and serve it to believer for the piece (real)
Say in boarpire?
If u think ur gonna get beamed for saying here just say in boarpire
Epoa continue
Its smth stupid and simple and were gonna be shaking our heads how we couldnt figure it out earlier
Well last time I unironically mentioned THE theory he just said that we didnt get to the next step yet...
And very incredible!
What was posted
I have 1% battery
Cant see the imgs
Beam
OMEGAGMA?
Is this the final step?
So kuudra rework?
Says 0% rn lol
Msg loaded
Its alpha from months ago
Ik ur shitposting, but imma look into that
What abt mc username?
Jacob was pretty active in fishing parties
W8 they have a point
What if 1 + 2 is C + I
Hmmm
Arch theories r brewing in my head rn
Jacob is here
Jacob is C I only a hint or a solution
If Jacob debunks everything again
Im done with this
Fishing party
Thank you so much
Ive been waiting so long for this
Im joining in 1h so i dont leak my ign and trash profile
Cya in 1h so my ign doesnt leak
Do it again until it works
If we get it today @Deleted User gets everything I have on sb
Even the investmemt stash
When will u understand that Sulphur Evolution is just a meme and shitpost
Ok wat we trying on next plhleg
Was the full inv of sulphur cubes debunked
Ok
Try everything bucket related
Just to debunk
Jacob said it isnt true
It was on debunked lists
Magical Milk bucket?
1st fishing party when he said brb he didnt come back until like 2h later
When fishing party over
Imma join soon
But randomly
So no1 knows my ign
NOW
fishing party
do fishing party
Pls
💀
Breh stop
It isnt
It isnt
Ok now i see
It isnt funny
I will stop
No
How to u get Herring The Fish tho
Is there fishing party rn
So i can get one
What did C I relate to this
Ok is the party active
Fishing party
I need my fish
And im not fishing 27
@Deleted User gib coins so i get fish
Not my fault
Since believer doesnt give a piece
Wtf is Herring used for
Is Herring The Fish a trigger for the piece?
Imma do Viking with Herring fish
Is there a fishing party rn
Ok now every1 gets my ign
Enjoy bullying me
Im joining rn
Who to join
Party
R there gonna be more fishing parties?
Or is it now solo for every1
Make fishing party some1
Is there an active party rn and whos leader
How do i get in the lobby
Fishing. 27.
Do u know any igns of ppl fishing
Im not fishing 27
Oh no
Gimme an ign
But still, just give pls
@Deleted User be my fishing slave for Plhlegblast. Thanks
Im not a cookie buyer or irl trader
I just got 5 gs in 200 runs
And invested 600m in pet skins last year
If some1 sus of me i can give Jacob proof my money making method is legit
It makes around 120m in 6h
Get gud
Kuudra 80m 6h
no hyp
YOU LEAKED MY FUCKING SKILL AVRG
NO HYP
NOTHING
I DID
Ign, skill avrg and nw
@Deleted User PLHLEG RN GIMME COINS
How many tries
To get it
HOW MANY TRIES TO GET IT
It wasnt hazy or wisdomly that nuked aquafina. I DID IT AND F U.
Ye i have DM proof i forced him into it
I nuked the server
CUZ U WOULDNT STOP BEGGING FOR MY HYP
Fishing party?
Ppl like me have
A reason
The fish equation?
If id get party leader's ign i give coins if the Fish works first time
The fish?
U GET MY HYP IF U GIMME THE LOBBY
I need the lobby
Where ppl fishing
Yes
Now that my ign leaked...
Can i get into guild but be perma muted?
Trash anime
Seen ending?
Bring them to Jake 😱
W8 did u block me
Beam?
@Floch is one of those bozos
I read announcements for the first time!
What did change abt the hunt tho?
Maybe Herring The Fish is the trigger
For the next step with believer
I think we will solve this equation faster than we solved first step
Is it missing some number things like the prvs 1 tho?
Wasnt there lol
I was talking how abt 1st step as in getting herring
Look up mine
Im on mobile so idk how
2981 results 💀
Can i now beg for guild invite, im sesasned and gimme perma mute in guild if i get into it. If i shitpost there perma beam me from the guild and from here
Ye ik
If some1 isnt fit to join thats the sulphur evo founder (although id voluntarily be perma muted)
???
What should we do now?
Did we try rightclicking all npcs with it
I dont think the equation result thing r coords
Its so funneh that i understand nothing any1 here is saying 😃
Ask Jacob when he gets online and starts talking (DONT PING HIM EVER) if theres possibly an error in it
💀
Can some1 explain this math stuff to me, i wanna help but idk how
The maths r just a hint tho
I am furry
I have boar furry clothes thing
I also want it to be true but idk if it is "inhales copium"
Ive been watching a ton of Marvel movies and shows when mining netherrack
It had a purpose... (Real and incredible)
What a real and very incredible line you've got there!
Me trying to understand anything said here: (whats this math stuff help)
Whats this math stuff
@Deleted User gimme a lecture on math stuff
@Deleted User help me understand this math stuff ur smort
Nice, I just barely passed!
I was 100% about to fail lol
Im very dumb
Im violently snorting Sulphur rn
Party me in like 3 mins
@Deleted User morb the equation so we solve this shit
HazyElk flashbacks...
Do u have it
Can we fish for it
@Deleted User help me with the math pwease
Solve the equation
And u get my hyp
Imma buy
Punch plhleg in lava with fish?
What happened in last 2h
Didnt Jacob say the hunt can be completed since day 1 of Crimson Isle releasing or smth like that tho?
Is the fish soulbound
Is any1 fishing rn
Is there any1 fishing rn
Inv me
give me the invite
/p join pigicial wont work
:waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah:
IM SO MAD THAT PLHLEG DIED
How do i make a party every1 can join
/p join arithemonkey for plhleg fishing so u get ur herring
Ari u there?
My friend has MVP++ how does he make a public party every1 can join?
/P JOIN NOT_AQUWUA FOR SWAG FISHING PARTY
Join it
MOST SWAG FISHING PARTY, /P JOIN NOT_AQUWUA
STOP spamming
Beam him
Beam him
Report
@Deleted User STOP OR NO HYP
/P JOIN NOT_AQUWUA FOR SWAG FISHING PARTY
/p join not_aquwua to get ur herring the fish
(no plhleg rn)
Any1 wanna make a fishing party (im not MVP++)
R there gonna be parties in the future so i can get it once
Fishing 27
Im fishing 24
I get like 85k xp an hour
+ its gonna get nerfed
Id pay for plhleg
Get me a lobby and i'll pay 3m
So no more parties in the future and i gotta grind over 60h of barnfishing for me?
We only know of mandible's existence cuz its a reforge stone so it must be in bz. Maybe mandible isnt last step
Mandiballs (dont beam me)
Since we have a Plhlegblast ping
Also make a fsihing praty ping
Ye but we only have 6 mins
For plhleg
Is 37382880 the relic coords
Is it still useful cuz its more than 1 year old
Had lvl 100 squid, recombed submerged shark, lucky dice on rod of sea b4 sold and barnfishing made only 85k an hour (during marina)
I was focusing 100% all the time
And 85k was most i ever got in 1h
I made 85k with best gear i could get
Ye all of em
Imma need around 60 hours to get 27
W8
More cuz fishing speed nerf
I was
I get 85k max during marina with a setup i sold
If theres ever a plhleg party
Ping the hell out of me
How do barn fishers get slugs
We have that
We need fsihing praty ping
y is every1 so against a fihsing patry ping?
It would be a role u choose
I was in a party with like 7 ppl b4 and none of them had fishing 26 all here for plhleg party
Now that we solved this part of believer
Will Jacob give us hint for the next part?
Or we do it by ourselves
Every1 remember if theres a fisinhg paryt ping the hell out of me
W8 he gave a hint?
U were in fihsing patry?
I pay 3m for plhleg lobby
Imagine we only need the number from equation not Herring in item form lol
I rlly hope its that
Final time saying it, but...
R there gonna be absolutely no more plhleg parties ever?
Its 99.999% required for next step
Thats it
Im renaming myself to in fishing 24 and get 85k xp an hour with marina
Ok imma pay
Ye ik
I always did that
Im focusing 100% of the time
Nothing but fishing
Idk y so bad xp
+ incoming fishing nerf
Netherrack gonna take me 20h when i rlly rlly focus and fishing 27 60h+ during marina and not counting the incoming nerf
Wanna make 1 tmmrw? R U fishing 27?
Yay
???
plhebglast
They died
I donated
And they died b4
I donated and it didnt work
How is that possible
?
Im literally deleting my profile @RiotRevoltz got 2 plhlegs i donated they werent near enough and they died b4 i could donate again
I dont i get 85k an hour
That sucks
And during marina
How near must plhleg be
Me and riotrevoltz had 2 and not near enough
Guys solve it b4 july ends cuz me and @Deleted User had a bet that he gets all my stuff if we dont
Pig r u gonna start uploading more content after the mandible viddeo?
I was half asleep during the final match
Herring The Fish made realize mandible isnt necessarily the final step
I thought it was the set, then arti then mandible cuz se know all od that exists
But Herring wasnt found anywhere b4 we discovered it
So there could be more b4 or after mandible
Epoa drinking game time
U talking abt so math chess variant?
Im interested
Wat is it
Its sad u had to do the alchemist staff plhleg thing (although i suggested it i think)
3m?
veradux ign
Veradux warp me 3m
3m
U GET 3m
Pls
@Synthesis i dont ping but pls
I need this
U GET 3m
Ign?
1 try
Just died and lost 5m
4202022?
GUYS
Imma never ask for fishing party again
Its done
Its over
Party time
I never say fishing party again
Ye its official
Imma do Viking with magical lava, magmafish bar and herring the fish
Arch doesnt like my fish
Loremaster likes magma cream and netherrack
Arch's skin is that
Dont u craft that with magma cream?
Drakuu also doesnt like my fish
Istg if Herring The Fish is an actual red herring...
No npcs care abt my funni fish :waah:
???
Alrdy used in archeologist
Forgor to change back my name 💀
Now with an extra w
U then i continued iirc
Imo it sucks cuz the kuudra npcs dont like it
I showed to every1
Im still trynna figure out what changed
Last time dont beam me pls...
What changed is that Sulphur Evolution is now canon (real)
test it myself
What if the amount to donate changed
Some1 alrdy mentioned this, but what if we donate today's date
Cuz Jacob said smth changed
Ur supposed to ping carrot not say "Do it 👍 " smh my head
3072022 is the amount
For today
Ok
So
7302022
Any1 wanna try it?
Ok i will @feel free to test it myself!
It despwans after 70 blocks
I dont think we done with believer tho
I think the number we get from solving the math is a donation value for believer not coords this time
Y coords tho
What would coords give us
Ye but just getting smth like kuudra relic the exact same way would be kinda lazy
So far Hunt hasnt reused stuff iirc
Oh u meant that
Ye
Most likely
Wats that
How fast can we solve the equation
Can we solve b4 july ends
gl with math stuff, imma leave the hunt alone until u solve the equation cuz i dont understand anything here
What happened in the last 12 hours
Did we do any math yet
*solve
Can u get more than one Herring The Fish
Y is me saying i will never say my iconic line again in pins 💀 (its very funni tho)
Make this beamable mods
I see this like 20 times a day
W8 for Plhlegblast ping
Math
Plegblast
Is pleg alive
I wanna donate sb release date
I can try second option
Epoa
Drinking game time
Happened to me once when 2 plegs and both not near enough
Is there a list of things we did with fish
Any1 thinking we only need the coords/donation value from fish
U cant get relic without clicking the book
So most likely need the fish as a trigger even when every1 knows the final number from equation
It wont but it can track if we've gotten the fish
We know the 2 and 22 thing
But we cant get relic without clicking the bookshelf
We dont say that word anymore
Check pins
?
Wat happened
Pls dont beam me
Gimme warning or mute
I dont wanna be beamed
Oh ok
Wait wtf is happening in vc
I still dk wat was happening
fr
Y do ppl always break chains when im the last to say it...
Ye
@Carrot
Corm looks like 🐗 + 🤓
W8 did we solve the equation?
As in coords or as in complicated math stuff
Theres X Y Z for coords in mc
So we have Z and not X and Y?
Oh no
How can we find X and Y then
Ummmm actually its 50m for next piece 🤓 🤓 🤓 🤓
Where is drinking game listed so ik when some1 says it
I see that stuff so much, this drinking game is basically sewiside
Ye
I need that
Not anymore
Ok from what im currently thinking, we have to find the X and Y similarly like the bookshelf?
Time to right and left click everything in the game with the fish :yep:
Arch?
What would the coords be with the 70 and 67 then
istg if divan's is involved again...
I hope the admins change to Just divan's and not hotm 7
"inhales copium" maybe x655
Copium theory begins
What if its bp 10 cuz when they were making it they used an admin pickaxe named Zoom
And forgor to change it
Now theyre acting like its intended
And herring gave em a chance to change back
The grind to hotm 7 is so painful...
I can just sell my gdrag, buy divan, sell divan and buy gdrag back
I will
But i need hotm 7 first :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah:
Wat chimera lvl?
Y did i get warning for saying off topic stuff here but didnt move to off topic when i havent Said anything for like 30 mins
#general
Do we have the coords alrdy
Did we solve coords yet
Anything yet?
Im bad at math
Me too
I legally cant say that word anymore. Its even in pins
Im responsible for that :)
No i didnt make the rule, I just said the word too many times
Only i get beamed if i say it
U can ask
Dw
The word was said 297 times
I said it 92 times
💀
Yes
Edition 37
Most likely related to Drakuu cuz their dialogues r similar, but it hasn't been confirmed they actually are related to the Hunt, although they most likely are
Biggest supporting factor in the @Floch theory
Was there a cataclysmic so bearded could test if u still need divan's
This makes no sense
Y would Jacob hint at us solving an NPC that only gives a fish and not a piece
Its confirmed there r full set and artifact
We have Arch and Drakuu rn
Thats 2 pieces (makes most sense if artifact last)
Drakuu makes a lot of sense to interact with after getting full set
The 2 guys at gate are prob not related to hunt, but if they are they are most likely part of Drakuu
W8
Some1 said Kuudra Gatekeeper
Ik
What NPC should we focus at now
I just hope the equation gives some hint for an npc
Im focusing at other stuff, cuz i suck at math
Oh ok
Imma do that
Did we try the 2 and 22
I frickin did that alrdy
I dont understand, imma just use the fish to interact with stuff for numbers
So similar to loremaster?
Ye i saw that
Hmmm
I rlly hope next piece is related to fish not a new npc
Me
But i need it
I can sell it soon
Bearded said Jacob confirmed in vc that we solved believer
Depends on what he meant
He couldve meant the believer step as a whole
Ye that we didnt
Or just the NPC believer part
Maybe the coords give us a piece
So its a lava block
SACRIFICE
Jacob couldve meant either we solved Believer the NPC or the whole Believer part of the Hunt
If its the second option, we prob need to smth with fish at the coords
And not Arch or Drakuu
Most logic is
That we get piece at coords
Imo
Btw did we try interacting with Deng after doing the book thing thing
Deng could maybe be related to the hunt
How did 1 + 1 make sense with the 4202022 donation
Is there a Spice Evolution in that book series?
Did the sandworms of arrakis become big and powerful cuz of spice
No, volcano does
Headcanon
Volcano is canonically older than kuudra
Sulphur made Kuudra into Kuudra
My name confirmed?????? OMG???
Jokes aside, in sb lore, Kuudra became Kuudra cuz it od'd on sulphur
Jacob confirmed sulphur evo isnt canon
I asked him if it is and he replied with a list of debunked stuff
Its just a meme and shitpost
To use in #general
Sulphur evo is (most likely) canon lore
But not related to hunt
Ik this might sound dumb, but did we try to put 4202022 into the equation?
The sheet doesnt mention it
Math 💀
How do i do it
Wot
@plhlegblast ping
Same
@SuperDuggy117 (chaos isnt online or is invis)
Ur invis
😄 😃  (beam moment)
How can i use this
Doesnt let me without nitro
Phone
#general
Ummm actually 🤓 🤓 🤓
Jacob listed to debunked list
He prob meant sulphur evo
Is sulphur block
Sulphur evo is mostly canon lore
Just not related to hunt
Its confirmed not to be hunt
A variation of the word i said i wont say in pins
Ik
If arch and believer are for same piece
What NPC is next piece
Who's for arti then
I was talking abt this: we're looking for 2 numbers for x/y, arch has 2 numbers hidden in his skin profile name or something, herring required using outside tools, and jacob seemed to be against separating arch / believer (back when we had a vote on what npc to focus on next) i reallly feel like we need to use arch's numbers but naively putting them in doesnt do anything (it gives a 6 digit number which pig already donated to believer without a plhlegblast nearby though)
Ik
If we'd beam leeches
Morbius would've been beamed
So in Kuudra Fight
When kuudra appears Its a big magma cube with 2 smaller ones on its head
Drakuu is prob human version of Kuudra
And the 2 guys at gate have similar dialogue to him
And also have magma cube Hood costumes
So Drakuu and those 2 are prob human kuudra
And related
NO
i actually have a non shitpost theory for once
And u gotta say sulphur evo
Also they are all mages
And Drakuu has same skin as Loremaster
And we know Loremaster time travelled
Idk
Did we alrdy put 4202022 into equation
420 and 2022
Deep Caverns' usual sponge is mineable netherrack
I think it was a hint for Loremaster
Or a coincidence
So a coincidence
Kuudra has 2 magma cubes on its head. Drakuu is most likely human version of Kuudra. 2 guys at gate are mages like Drakuu and wear magma cube/kuudra costumes. Their dialogues are very similar.
Nop
He has same skin as Loremaster tho
So its prob that ur mixing up
STOP
Oh
I just noticed lol
Drakuu is prob after full set tho
This is just smth to keep in mind
Trying wat
I just pointed out their connections
I also have collat for divan
Any1 wanna trade
When hotm 7
Wat abt lvl 200 gdrag
Gdrag costs more than divan's
Gdrag lb 1.18b today
Wat u smoking? Sulphur?
I got mine for like 1.2b
My is 200m
Lvl 200
Yes
Yes
Do u need to give archeologist the relic during the cataclysmic erruption or any time?
And real
I have gdrag collat
And hyp colat
My username
the website thing is basically sulphur evo at this point
Beam from the theory's official cult server
You can buy it from Jake for 4202022 coins after bringing a Plhlegblast to it with Necromancy
Kooder's Mandiballs???
*@Floch and @Deleted User are weird
Ur the nasa guy
I can pay other ppl at nasa to help the hunt
Y r there 50 dead spiders in my hotel room?
Wtf did u do?
Y DID THEY START MOVING
I think we should test more stuff with Viking cuz the trophy fish achievement thing is kinda a  random feature
/toggle music also #general question
1. The Rift is for next update
Was the whole Viking thing deconfirmed by Jacob or no?
I still think that the equation is the red herring and the Fish is actually used, just not the equation.
The text b4 equation says not_a_hint:
So admins saying not to overthink
Could mean its actually not a hint
We should use critical thinking
The 4202022 made sense cuz of kuudra's return bein when crimson isle released
So we should look more into the fish
Can we get numbers from item/NPC/mob names or skins (without hexadecimals)
I dont rlly like hexadecimals
They r kinda reusing coords rn tho
Cuz they alrdy used getting coords from an equation in relic part
Pablo is mage faction locked tho
What if the function is the red herring not the fish
Think critically
4202022 made sense crimson isle release is techincally kuudras return
Hyperanalyze everything abt the fish
What if the equation is the red herring
It says not a hint
Maybe we should take it literally
Yes
Try stuff with fish
Not equation
The new s e
Also didnt admins say we should overthink
Typo
Amyways
If we shouldnt overthink, then its prob actually not a hint
Wait am i overthinking?
90% for when full set
i rember
Did we try throwing fish back in the pond
Well im not losing my edition 37...
Speak up
Y?
I dont wanna see any hexadecimals
@Crooryine You have used your daily Hexadecimals!
Textwall = beam
I hate hexadecimals so much
I am in physical pain bcuz of the hexadecimals pls stop
Back to mandible pls
Back to Herring theories pls :hollow:
Change ur name
Yay
If jacob debunks hexadecimals i will give him 5k$
Now back to kooder's jaw
What makes sense to test with fish
Fish
Back to equation ig
It say not_a_hint:
Thats sus
Maybe he doesnt know kuudra is back?
What if Arch just doesnt know Kuudra alrdy returned?
We should show arch kuudra alrdy returned
Believer isnt a Kuudra Follower
Like archeologist and loremaster
Cuz he doesnt have a piece
Arch prob doesnt know kuudra returned bruh
Were overthinking
And y we talking abt arch
We have to solve fish
Arch is sus. He has netherrack and magma skin. Like loremaster's fav items
Didnt an admin say mandible isnt a Kuudra drop tho?
Mandible is the last thing 99%
Could the name Arch mean smth
Can we focus on fish tho
Bring him a term cuz its expensive and requires a hard milestonen like divan's
Rampart armor
Rampart armor bein named that is sussy
Term is different too
3 arrows + beam
Maybe the equation is a red herring
And we should focus just on the fish
The nbt says
Not. A. Hint.
h*x 🤮
Why
Focus on what we have instead
Not frickin arch
For Kuudra Follower armor or Rampar?
Do all pieces have same h*xcode
Or is 1 different
Alchemist staff if the only communication is coins then?
Hmmmmm
Here goes THE theory :waah:
Its called beamable
Not bannable
Back to mandible pls
Can we talk abt the mandible, thank you
Idfk
Im not
U are
Were still not talking abt the mandible breh
The communication to kuudra with coins is interesting
No, please no, not again.
Yes
Why tho?
Maybe its a wishing well and he throws coins into the pool for Kuudra
#general
Text wall beam him now
That word makes me feel physical pain
No sulphur
No
Forget sulphur
I just said no sulphur. Kuudra teeth desc kinda sus so prob used in Layer steps
Chaos
MB, i thought u were talking to me
Vector the equation has vectors solve it thanks 👍
Im so disappointed pleggy in bucket never worked
So much potential...
Wat happened
To hypixel
*high pickle
Anyways back to mandible
Ok gtg cya tmmrw gl with the equation
When did u join this server
Kinda sus
What if ur he*adecimal guy's alt
#general
Imma get veteran b4 u
#general
Throw fish in back into the pleggy pool, i dont think u lose it cuz lava returns items now iirc
Censor it
That word is not allowed
Did we try looking for numbers in the actual kuudra fight
I lost 48m when getting my Herring for the same reason
It expired like 20 mins b4...
Is there any crimson isle NPC with numbers in their dialogue
Did we try putting the code in the equation alrdy
But i dont think it would be, cuz its a new number every day
Unless its a donation value not coords, which is highly unlikely
If we get any new dialogue from NPCs that say numbers i will test as donation value too
What could it be then?
Ok ik this sounds dumb
But what if we have to turn the numbers into letters (without h*xadecimals 🤮) and use as chat trigger?
To believer
Thats just a quest
What else could be numbers, but not coords or donation value
H*xadecimals are banned
Unless theres another way that makes sense
To convert numbers into letters
Its actually h*********l (9 *'s)
Epoa is doing Kuudra a viable option for me when my method dies (i have like 8 double chests of keys)
Maybe the number we get is some kind of code like the barb faction one, cuz in Loremaster dialogue its kinda hinting at a group of ppl who believe in kuudra as he says that line is a classic.
(the number we will get from solving equation, not the one to plug in)
Me waiting for seafoam arma sticker:
:pepeselfie:
So it cant be new dialogue?
Elle wtf
Nooooo
Lets all go to #general and say ourple
Next update. Check #read-me-first and the Hunt website by carrit
U can click on the @ ON to reply to Jacob without pinging him
Ye
No ping
See?
Is what Jacob said a :lead_maybe:
:SquidInBucket: bucket plhleg supremacy
What if the change only applies to players when they find a Herring?
:SquidInBucket: :psquid:
Ok now back to topic
Censor h*xadecimal NOW
#general
Y does this guy keep pinging chaos
Brilliant
We need X and Y
And there r X and Y items
Check their nbts
I think theyre related
Give fish to Lasea
Is this a warning for me or?
Pogo u just randomly said what more times than I have said the words im no longer allowed to say lol
Anyways back to mandible
Equation anwser could be some code/code chat trigger cuz Loremaster dialogue kinda hinting there is a group of ppl who believe in kuudra
What happened in last 6h
Ye every1 knows that
Boar created all of existence
Ok now back to mandible
Kuudra gave us that fish
The missing X and Y will prob be given to us by kuudra too
Imma hyperanalyze kuudra fight
I need 3 ppl
Me but i suck at mana bombs
How did u read that
?
I think Deng might be involved
Did any1 talk to Deng after clicking book
Who can help me try the newest idea in #hunt-ideas
Its very complicated to me, but i can help in kuudra fight
Aura lab has sussy golem heads ive been trynna figure out what it means
Were 4k intel book hint guy, netherwart barb guy and corm also removed?
Aura could be just a hint NPC
Ok aura is unrelated
Back to Kooder's Mandiballs
On the topic of stickers, make a seafoam arma sticker
💀
Fishing 27 + plhleg is pretty grindy
Breh imma get even less xp than 85k an hour now if the nerf is true
Breh
Me waiting for Derpy: :pepeselfie:
Pacifist kuudra run for artifact is my theory
With full kuudra follower armor
Ye, it exists
I think Drakuu gives the artifact after pacifist kuudra run in full Kuudra Follower armor
How does that make any sense? Its prob a different NPC or just 1 reused from b4
Hotm 7 is more evil tho
Comms to hotm 7 r pain
U can buy enrager + i only get 15k xp in 2 hours
Drakuu's and 2 guys' at gate dialogue hints to it
U can when sm1 drops one
Either way, hotm 7 is pain
Its a WIP pfp
When i can im making an anti-boar pfp
Ok back to mandible
Try finding numbers in other fish
This is a certified fish moment
Whats ur total museum value
What fish is worth so much lol
Also, cuz u have all fish check their nbts
I asked to see for NBTs for equation bruh
If there were any other fish added in nether update
Gimme nbts
Check nbts
This is #hunt-discussion not next update discussion
Wdym, that clash of clans update video gave us so much Kooder's Mandiballs content
The thumbnail was abt Kooder's Mandiballs tho...
Diamond the fish?
R there any other fish added in crimson isle?
Beam him now (real)
Not funny + #general
Nice 👍 👍
Term for Arch cuz arch could be short for archer and eman 7 (was) kinda hard like hotm 7
Yes, copium
Clockseller y do u delete ur mssgs often its annoying
Beam him now (real and incredible)
Epoa i think what it could be if it isnt coords or donation
It could be a code/code chat trigger
Code cuz Loremaster dialogue hints at there being some kuudra enthusiast club so maybe code for them, but idk if believer is part of that group
Anything happen in last 9h?
Try release date of sb
Cuz thats when og blazing fortress
Didnt some admin say not everything has to be lore related with Hunt
Use the money from Ink Sacks u sold to more testing
Plhleg's drops r like 3m
I heard it somewhere
Here @Carrot @10K_KxYS (⌐■_■)/
He said Jacob seems to have implied
💀
R there any more donation values to try
Cuz otherwise imma just donate random values slightly related to nether
Anything less than 20m?
The thing i dont rlly like is a joke
Anyways back to mandible
Any values or no?
I can donate myself but im not giving anyone money to donate i dont trust ppl
Im trying to get fishing 27 but its so painful
When it comes to fishing, I have a large skill issue. Idk y
Anyways #general now back to mandiballs
I hate fishing in all games
Not first time. He started the whole discussion on sulphur and the word i cant say
That must be the bottom of smth
Maybe the secret house in a rock
Not funny + #general + pls join its official server its in my about you
I like epoa's theory that its not coords or donation value
It could be a code to tell to an NPC
That its not coords or npc
The equation results could be a code to tell to an NPC and the NPC gives u a piece
How does Hunt ideas work noe
I wanna submit smth
Believer?
How does it differentiate between reasoning idea and expected result
For legal reasons that was a joke
Your saying it like u actually do even though u dont
Ok posted new thing in #hunt-ideas, saying this here cuz most ppl dont read that
🤓
What fisherman npc
Sirius made the most
I spent 700m on my seal that i havent even purchased yet :hollow:
The good ol days when all i did was buy ice for hours and sell on ah
The result is a code to say to Believer then kuudra makes a armor piece float up cuz the fish is a riddle kuudra gave us
My headcanon ^
For legal reasons that was a joke
Does any1 have any ideas how to get hotm7 fast i need my leggings
Doin that, i only get 15k in 2h (massive skill issue)
Also can hyps/lvl 200 gdrags be used as collat
W8 mine is one of the first 100 iirc
Even if i get scammed and dont lose value
That hyp means a lot to me
Gdrag + 100m coins work?
(lvl 200)
Lvl 200 gdrag dropped in price
Now 1.09b
Ok
I have collat then
Time to sweat nucleus runs
And drop an alloy (real)
Hotm 7 gonna take 3 times longer than netherrack
Well atleast doing nucleus runs is very fun
But comms r hell
Takes like 2 months
Otherwise 3 days
Also one last #general question
Is any1 in this server a trusted divan collater
The one b4 the latest one is even more stupid
People should read #hunt-ideas and #hunt-tested
Would make things easier for every1
Y would ppl yoink it? They dont get any money from it
Does any1 have a high edition one
I can overpay collat and will pay 30m if i dont get scammed
How many ppl here even have one?
Hyp + gdrag?
Should i just grind the 1b and buy it myself
Im planning on doin mining anyways
Should i prioritize netherrack mining or hotm7 grinding
I cant drop an alloy in like 50 runs lol
Its 1 in 8k, rolled once and not affected my magic find
How do ppl even get it lmfao
Am i trusted enough to ping if i find cataclysmic
If i abuse it u can permabeam me
The only time i did smth with pings was pinging pogo ystrdy
U can trust me
Kheharad
He says he has smth to sell u later
Lets make a kheharad party
Kheharad's dialogue is very sussy baka
Kheharad is hella sus
Smth def unlocks him
?
Try stuff with kheharad
Dwagoon beam?
Dwagon go to kheharad since ur fishing
Prob some crimson isle 2 shit like with gwendolyn
Also smth i noticed when stalking kuudra npcs
Loremaster and drakuu have samd skin
And we know loremaster time travelled
But that would destroy the Human Kuudra Theory
Human Kuudra Theory is lore that implies Drakuu and 2 guys at gate r connected
2 guys at forgotten skull have similar dialaogue as drakuu
Drakuu is prob human kuudra
In hot tier we see kuudra
On top of kuudra's head there r 2 magma cubes
And 2 guys at gate have magma cube face hoods
But 2 guys at gate have magma cube face hoods
Kinda sus
Cuz similar dialogue to drakuu
Ive said in dragoon's server long ago that if 2 guys at gate and drakuu are NOT related im voiding my hyp or smth like fhat
Drakuu is basically saying he is human kuudra lol
When we pacifist run kuudra he will be grateful and give us artifact (mods dont attack me this is my headcanon)
Hes saying we dont understand kuudra
With full kuudra follower armor
Any1 wanna do a 24h one
So the step for mandible is completable no matter what we have rn?
ic
Also makes sense we need it for artifact then
And drakuu's dialogue we prob need full kuudra follower for him
@Carrot just checked #read-me-first and human kuudra theory is in drakuu section lol
Source?
Kuudra gave us a riddle to solve and if we do kuudra will reward us with a piece. (Dont attack me mods, just my theory)
Ik
But no1 said ee can conplete at any time
Lavapool
Is communication with kuudra
So there must be other ways too?
Herring imo is a riddle given to us by kuudra
Herring is a test
If we complete it kuudra rewards us eith a piece
nice ratio
Back to mandible
If we complete equation kuudra will see we truly r a follower of kuudra and gib da helmet
Arch makes too much sense to be chestplate
Yes i did :feelsbadman:
No herring is a riddle
We have to solve to prove to kuudra we believe in it
A code imo
Or donation value
If kuudra gave us herring as a test of if we are loyal to it
Its a donation value in that case
Ye but still
It makes sense kuudra would want to see if we are true followers of it
Through that equation
pogo :PogoDuck: :PingDuck:
:PingDuck:
Is pogo adding seafoam arma sticker? (real)
Ye ikr
He deletes everything he says
For legal reasons that was a joke
The equation is a lie
Yes
The helmet will come from the lavapool 99%
(the other 1% is so mods dont attack me abt me being certain its helmet)
If it isnt helmet i will void my hyp
Clockseller stop constantly editing/deleting ur mssgs its annoying
What if the equation leads to another one lol
I totally see that happening
Hotm 7 is a req so i can expect smth of that lvl of mean
The only thing i need to know is if we could find the thing that changed eithout jacob mentioning it
Was the change made when 1st herring was found or is it for players with herring?
That info sould rlly help
Pogo is brainstorming random ideas bannable
Solved steps not changed
Hmmmmm
Is there any stuff to test rn
:hollow:
Tested
Kheharad is prob gwendolyn for a crimson isle 2 type things
Human kuudra theory for Drakuu 😎
Kuudra gave it to us as a test if we are a true follower of kuudra and when we solve equation we get helmet (my opinion dont attack me mods)
Pogo typing :monkaS:
Phew
Beam
Im afraid bad idea = beam
Then kuudra rewards us
Deng is so sus yet so useless...
Corm must be related somehow
Or its just general sb lore
But magmag desc...
Also sm1 like Alluin is Yoink
Yoink says he likes watching netherwart grow
There must be some npc hinting at what to do rn
We have 2 hint npcs alrdy
Alluin and Yoink
Imma donate first pets update cuz thats when ember rod got removed from magma boos loot table cuz im desperate
Stupid idea time 😎
What if deng has a herring
And is thinking abt solving it
Show a herring to deng
Me
Some boarbarian npc that needs to think
Show herring to deng maybe he owns a herring and is thinking abt how to solve it
Nooooo
Click him with feesh
AYO WYF
I understand now
If i ever dropped an alloy and made divan i wouldnt collat it
Same
Thats cuz im mage
Lol
My feesh is #37 :hollow: :hollow: :hollow:
SHOULD I PING POGO
When me and riotrevoltz were fishing they got one in like 10 mins of fishing b4 swuid hat change
@uwudwagonl PET UPDATE RELEASE DATE
100 ench ink sacs (like 7m)
DO NOT KILL IT
Y u here then? :hollow:
@Mr Mindcraft IS THIS AQUA
R U ANOTHER AQUA'S ALT
@Mr Mindcraft pls stop aqua
PET UPDATE
Release date
N O W
Sm1 do it
Shitttt
BRUUUUUH
imma do it myself
Fishing when ur 27+ sounds extremely fun
How much golden jerry boxes for fishing 27
From 24 to 27
Ok now back on topic
:hollow: 💀 :waah: :nop: :psquid: :SquidInBucket: :sus: :linusweird: :lead_maybe:
Dwagoon dont do a ping for a test
So what should we do for herring rn :feelsbadman:
wat happened in last 1h
SO IT WOULDNT DETRANSFORM INTO A PLHLEG AGAIN. Boom. Sulphur Evolution
put in tested:
- kheharad equation chat trigger, fish click
- deng equation chat trigger, fish click
same, but lets just solve it :feelsbadman: :hollow:
wtfrick
i didnt know this
We finished loremaster
We have his piece alrdy
Jcob confirme dit
Also if any npc is kuudra
Thats drakuu
Yes
You should read #read-me-first and check out the awesome website made by carrot and duggy!
Wtf
Jacob here?
:hollow:
Can we stop abt sulphur
The ironic thing is that pig started sulphur evo (then i shitpostified it)
Is it a real idea or another joke?
:nop:
I originally said that idea as a joke lol
I rather donate intenger limit to beluever than listen abt sulphur ever again
I have one of those!
Open the party ig?
Wots that
Is there a f p rn?
I cant say the word
Lets fish
I wanna fish too
Im fishing 27 now
No kuudra chat triggers on wizard work
I just got a lead from pogo (real)
Where is the mandible meeting
I am a true mandiballer
what lobby did the mandible meeting migrate to?
wat lobby is it in rn?
i did some stalking and all of u r in ur mandible meeting uniforms
kinda sus
put saying equation and feesh clicking on Kheharad and Deng into #hunt-tested
Could the change mean that smth that didnt work b4 works now?
Can we now talk about the fucking mandible thank you
#general
U gud?
Read #read-me-first and check the amazing website made by Duggy and Carrot for updates.
We need an X and Y to plug into the equation
Ye i want to try that too
But no feeshegn patyr
Req for using mandible is 33
Did we try putting 33 into equation or 3 and 33 cuz prvs was 2 and 22
Idk rlly :feelsbadman:
Mods beam him rn (real)
Conspiracy theorist 🤮
Gm
stupid Rhanora's cats wont eat the funni feesh
can sm1 paste the fish equation here
thx
put saying equation to loremaster in #hunt-tested
and also to deng and kheharad
scarleton is rather interesting
The Sky gave mages sulphur???
Velyna dialogue hella sus
kk
did nothing
what is the sword with emblems on it
could it be blade of volacno?
cuz it has enchanted texture even when unenchanted
i think that was the only sword except sword of bad health
guys should i drop herring in velyna's magical fire
found pretty interesting stuff in scarleton
now imma try dragontail
any donation values to try
Ive tried fish/equation things with all scarleton/dragontail npcs :yep:
idk what to do anymore
4202022 gave herring
every. npc. in. scarleton. and. dragontail. :feelsbadman:
if i'd join it would be less dead
i was testing stuff earlier today
Anything to test rn?
@deleted-role i gotta hyperanalyze the boss fight (duggy dont beam me im not jk i just want a run ok)
literally every single block and feature
who wanna do the kuudra
2/4
wanna do the kuudra?
i saw sm1 do it here
can i ping it again in #general
also i pinged here cuz the run is purely for testing/analyzing stuff
any1 wanna kuudra run for testing stuff
2/4
Same lol
yes very sad, but also #general
sm1 do kuudra w me 2/4
its purely testing and analyzing stuff
put in tested:
being in kuudra for 4 mins 20s
bein in kuudra on same run until 20 mins 22s
fish slapping everything even tentacles
saying equation when run ends
all this was done in the normal tier
tried fish on every faction npc
today
:hollow:
kuudra od-ing on sulphur is most likely only lore and not related to hunt
Put this stuff i did in kuudra run in hunt tested and the 420 and 2022 thing i did was waiting for 4 mins 20 secs then waited until 20 mins 22 secs. Should i also try 4 mins 20 secs then 20 mins and 22 secs on top of that?
Yes now stop mentioning it :hollow:
We tried too much stuff with it lol
Ye but when i asked jacob if sulphur evolution is canon he replied a list of tested ideas.
💀
Is trying to find out what the jungle planks, red sand, terracotta and another terracotta color pads mean overthinking?
Im so close to hotm 7 :hollow:
Can you elaborate further on why that could be the case?
Even tho hunt is linear, it makes sense to me to interact with Drakuu at full Kuudra Follower Armor bcuz of his dialogue
I just bought a fire veil on ah and salvaged for mage quest, ashfang sucks
Idk if it does, i did that on the 1st day of its release, mightve been patched a very long time ago
:lead: :lead_maybe: :hollow: :waah:
I got 6 on dice then talked to him (but hunt was still linear then)
Me when Herring: :lead: :lead_maybe: :hollow: :waah:
f e e s h
But the equation is 70% not a red herring bcuz its prob a riddle kuudra gave us to solve and then kuudra makes a piece float up from the lavapool
Kuudra gaves us that f e e s h. And for a reason.
What if Kuudra is Dueces after he ate too much Sulphur not a Plhlegblast and him going to work for Bezos is a coverup???? 🐗 🤯
You should read all of #read-me-first and check out the amzing website made by carrot and duggy for updates!
Is any1 crazy enough to help me fish for double hook plhleg so i donate 8404044 coins :yep:
Imma try double hook plhleg and 8404044 coins
But no Feeshngin Prati
Not in hunt tested
Lets go do it :yep: :yep: :yep:
@RiotRevoltz got one in like 10 mins of fishing when we were fishing. wanna fish again riotrevoltz?
me with like 45k xp to hotm 7:
We can add 2 dungeon npcs to abiphone
Thats sus
@Deleted User, read all of #read-me-first and check the awesome website made by carrot and duggy for updates!
donate 8404044
is he alive
the plhleg
breh
did u try 8404044
double amount cuz double plhlegblast
we must test 8404044 on double hooked plhleg
i can donate if sm1 catches it
Is pig fishing rn
jacob moment
Real
drakuu gives artifact
when we have full set
prob
beam time
when you say that word, at least censor it
I still think we should test double hook plhleg and donating 8404044 coins
I think smth cool would be that when we solve the funni mandible admins reward us with the 3 new kuudra tiers and kuudra revamp (they will have enough time to work on it, were prob solving this in like december)
#hunt-tested
What if i donate
Since we know Kuudra gave us that f e e s h to test us if we are a true follower of it, it wouldnt be that crazy to say drakuu is a human manifestation of kuudra wanting to talk to us when we get full kuudra follower armor and "knowing wgat to do when fighting kuudra and understanding kuudra".
Do u have 400 more keys tho? How many barb dukes kills u got?
Wot how did u get 619 keys then
On the top of its dumb face there are 2 magma cubes and since drakuu could be human kuudra, aviar and gnyl could be those magma cubes thus also human kuudra and their dialogue is also very similar 🤓 🤓 🤓
U can profit without using keys every run?
Guys which theory do u hate more? S E ttheory or Human Kuudra theory:
Ok now back to mandible
So i dont get another warning
Cuz no mandible in #general?
Ok imma do it
S E is off topic, as it is debunked and a meme.
Bcuz human kuudra isnt off topic
Throwing herring into fortune teller flames did nothing
It was just a joke lol
11k xp to hotm 7 💀
Anyways wat u guys taking as collat
I have hyp and gdrag
If any1 here with divan that takes collat, is hyp or gdrag goog
Kuudra gave us that f e e s h
Kuudra will prob somehow give us the X and Y
Most likely by donating
If you are new here, I suggest you read all of #read-me-first to understand everything we have about the hunt. Alao check the awesome website made by carrot and duggy for updates.
I only said today kuudra will give us X and Y
I love fishing at the bridge with fren while hypm clears if mobs attack
If you are new here, I suggest you read all of #read-me-first to understand everything we have about the hunt. Alao check the awesome website made by carrot and duggy for updates.
@VeryUniqueName, I suggest you read all of #read-me-first to understand everything we have about the hunt. Also check the awesome website made by carrot and duggy for updates.
We need to put an X and Y into the equation
So tell us if you find new numbers from npc dialogue or otherwise
11k xp to hotm 7 :hollow:
What
Math stuff
*Kooder's Mandiballs
Also i still think a lvl 100 magma cube is needed
Sm1 show it to Strux
Talk to strux with a lvl 100 leg magma cube
He says magma cube pets r forbidden in dragontail
Lvl 100 leg magma cube to strux cuz he says magma cube pets forbidden in dragontail
Also magma cube pet is related to ember armmor
Corm
does any1 have a lvl 100 leg magma cube to speak to arch and strux with it
if u get double hook try 8404044 and 2101011
:waah: imma miss him
maybe the change was for the relic?
me neither
hotm 7 is pain
ye but it wouldnt require legs
just a relic
maybe herring is a red herring, but the fact its nbt could be a hint hunt could reuse stuff?
cuz we alrdy had an equation b4 and at archeologist
were currently trusting a fish equation which says not a hint. . .
i have 100% faith in the fish tho
Relic stuff
We should try stuff with relic
Dont say radio...
Wot
I said equation and fish slapped almost every scarleton npc
Including book guy
Also almost all dragontail ppl
Do u even have it?
Ur new here
Rlly?
Nice
Im 100% sure the helmet will come from the lavapool when we donate equation result
No
Chestplate unites the set, so chestplate comes from arch
I rlly like the believer part of kuudra giving us a test tgo
Kinda setting up for the final step lol
Im like 80% sure its a donation value
I htink its like this:
We fish up plhleg, we donate equation, helmet floats from lava
Donating intemger wouldnt make sense
What makes more sense here?
1. We go to coords and helmet is dug out at coords
2. We fish up psquid, donate equation, kuudra makes the helmet float up from the lava
Believer has been shown to have the least knowledge about kuudra
If he had a piece he'd give it to us when he saw kooder gave us a f e e s h
Wot
Arch
We get the helmet from lavapool after donating equation imo
I said imo
Not that its guaranteed
But arch is all about uniting and chestplate unites the set
@Carrot
What has become of this channel :waah:
B4 compaxt i got 119k in 30 mins 👍
Rogue sword gives 45 fortune instead of 50
Jacob typing :monkaS:
Jacob said smth then deleted
Istg we should add a ping role that alerts u when jacob says smth in hunt discussion
*Its called ghost libged
Carrot you became duggy and clockseller
You delete ur mssgs
Anyways, #general
Now back to mandible
If you are new here you should read #read-me-first and check out the amazing website my carrot and duggy for updates
The hint boar is my last hope for this hunt :feelsbadman:
Its been 2 weeks since we got herring and no :lead: yet :feelsbadman:
Can u explain rq
Well C I was literally crimson isles, so...
Are we 100% sure we need to find the X and Y?
Which idea
wats the texture of the artifact
ye ik but its bad quality
i hate pings
i am now the guy you have to always ping
its funny tho
i wanna see how it was for carrot getting pinged 20 times in 1 minute
nah im not changing it, im bored of changing it (mandible: check nbts of other fish items if theres any numbers there)
only for diamond and gabagool
i meant every the fish item in the game
Is there anything to test rn
he said he didnt go and rework values and change was alrdy there
what if we have to feed something with the fish
imma say the line...
feeshign patyr
try everything we tried b4
Should we retest everything now
Cuz it could be smth that prvsly didnt work
What happened in last 6h
If you are new here, I suggest you read all of #read-me-first and check the awesome website by carrot and duggy for updates!
Talk about Barry in #general as he is for the next update, and unrelated to the mandible
Proof
where is jacob
If you are new here, I suggest you read all of #read-me-first and check the awesome website by carrot and duggy for updates!
i just need his timezone
wots ur timezone
Me waiting for the hint be like:
I just wanna be done with believer
When will jacob come back
I fed jacob a sulphur cube and he turned into Boardraa
Now back to mandible
What should i name myself
This one is kinda needed tho
@zoz
im the guy u ping when ppl go off topic
@carortalt
@Floch
if ham radio returns, so does sulphur evolution
aviex better not mention the radio, cuz i actually have a new theory and potential evidence for sulphur evo
The fish gives more proof of sulphur evolution
kuudra only gives it WHEN a plhlegblast is nearby
because plhlegblast is a kuudra who didnt eat sulphur in a long time so it detransformed
the change could be that sulphur on plhleg now works
we should try it
Blame @Tenatian, Kuudra Understander
the sulphurifed monsters detransform after not having sulphur for too long
plhlegblasts only exist cuz of kudura detransforming as they are extinct on the isle, like pigs. Pigs are the detransformed piglins when they dont eat sulphur
sulphur makes thigns violent, like the mage outlaw
kuudra steals sulphur bcuz it doesnt want to detransform
:yep:
nothing
(mods i wont mention that theory again in this channel, i just rlly dont want ham radio to come back)
JACOB BLESS US WITH YOUR HINT
is it sulphur evolution confirmed???
(real)
jacob confirm sulphur
(real and very incredible)
. . .
me trying to extract a hint from that emoji:
jacob are sulphur evo and ham radio fully deconfirmed and have nothing to do with anything?
wait dctr also left for amazon?
sadge
jacob ping (real)
THERE IS A CRIMSON ISLE ITEM CALLED BEZOS
TROPICAL BIRD MINION SKIN???
so the mandible doesnt exist for some of us?
@Dwagoon
oh he banned :waah:
on thanksgiving
_filler
amongoose
pogo is the clue
amongoose is officialy a hint
hyperanalyze the video
jacob will there ever be an alchemy update
the hint is among us
so its shimmer dragon skins
the amogus skins
:hollow:
among us is the hint so shimmer dragon skins which r amogus. MANDIBALLS P2W OMG WTFRICK??????????
your ratio sucks
an alchemy update is needed jacob
jacob can you give a good hint so we can move on to arch :hollow:
textwall = beam
hint!
hint?
hint.
hint :hollow:
:lead_maybe:
ok now its hintin' time
this guy said he intends to troll
and is only here to troll
ok now its hintin' time
try talking to believer in shimmer dragon helmet skins
cuz amogus
@carortalt
3/4 to finishing water bottle for alchemy
btw mafin when u building the mutant bocaJ
how many days after derpy ends
why u should be beamed: 1. u disrespect the ourple multiverse 2. u pinged jacob (real and very incredible)
is the lavapool big enough to fit a kuudra tentacle???
btw pogo wots ur pfp
wot is this send help
did anything happen in last 2 mins
herring = :lead: :lead_maybe: :hollow: :waah:
so did we get the hint
@carortalt
who cares abt edition 1, lets just find the funni mandible :hollow:
the hint boar was prob a lie
jacob when can we focus on arch

without bringing him to the sea bruh
make bocaj's nose nether bricks ty
did thunder soul do anything
do we have any new :lead:
boar
ITS MAFINAM'S BOARDRAA
^ ok now my name b4 chaos starts killing ppl
☠️ PogoDuck burnt to death.
he still died to lava
doesnt change that
maybe the tides r volcano rising at odger?
i have active volcano at odger rn
explosive
LET ME IIIIIIIINNNNNNNN
i rather donate all those numbers than learn what directional derivatives are
fishing 27 better than learnign math
ye ik
rip, i accidentally donated 3m to beliver trying to get out of the menu somehow today
agreed
it could be odger cuz hes on top of the volcano and whatever we have to do is when the lava in volcano rises (no, not cataclysmic)
FlochForster
inv me
full
i wanna test smth
for like 2 weeks now
sadge
im in
LETS GOOOOOO
WHATS THE EXACT DATE OF SECOND PETS UPDATE
EXACT DATE OF SECOND PETS UPDATE
I NEED IT
TO DONATE
HOW TO TURN INTO DONO
5062019?
ok im donating
nothing
put in #hunt-tested
removed ember rod drop from magma boss (kinda related to nether)
could be odger when volcano rises
a trigger???
plhlegblast is to believer like tide is to shore??? idk
also i tested 5062020
try some diamond fish on viking furnace
me when no kuudra follower equipment:
can u put 5062020 in hunt tested
amongoose
BOARS
what if like viking misses the sea, beliver misses kuudra
Any new :lead: in last 12h?
What abt new ideas to test?
I cant read 12h of this chaos lol
Thats the first thing i read when i log on lmfao
I still think we should give viking a dia trophy fish
If you are new here, read all of #read-me-first and check the awesome website by carrot and duggy for updates!
I have the volcano stonefish or whatever its called
I will miss it
If it wont work it will just do the achievement dialogue again.
But i alrdy have the achievement so will it consume it?
If it does nothing you owe me 60 magmafish
Im not trusting any1 saying they did it without video proof
Unless its sm1 trusted and dedicated
Ok no video proof or it didnt happen
What abt double hook plhleg and 8404044 or 2101011 (i will donate, just get me the plebbies)
When was the dialogue for tears added???
What if the equation is a different date when kuudra returned in the past
What can i test that doesnt involve math or losing my dia stonefish
If its diamond trophy fish, i hope its volcanic stonefish
Would make the most sense
So it makes sense for viking
The new viking achievement, the existence of magmafish hat and magical lava, the months for viking obly updating in 2022, jacob's hint...
All of this makes too much sense not to be viking
Then we get number, put in equation, donate during plhleg and then helmet floats up from the lavapool
Ye
We did
A lot of things
Magmafish hat and achievemnt r so sussy
It wouldnt give the piece, but numbers
Old blazing fortress:
The achievement is screaming "hint"
They didnt add any outside crimson isle random stuff in new crimson isle achivements EXCEPT VIKING
Achievement
Meal Fit For A King
I suggest you read all of #read-me-first and check out the amazing website by carrot and duggy for updates!
Its too random...
I hope its putting volcanic stonefish into viking furnace
A diamond one
Sm1 do the relic coords gif and nethereart gif rq
W H Y
Wait that stupid idea gave me a goog idea
Legs were hotm 7 and divanon, boots were 5m nether magma and 1024 of each ench, so this could be all diamond or gold trophy fish and one of them to give to viking
Its a grind like the ones b4
I suggest you read all of #read-me-first and check out the amazing website by carrot and duggy for updates!
Thats y i said it could be also gold
Shameless promo for my new idea in #hunt-ideas
I have new idea
@feel free to do it yourself!
He wants to fish but broke his leg
Grind as in comp of all gold/dia trophy fishes and a specific one to give to viking
I suggest you read all of #read-me-first and check out the amazing website by carrot and duggy for updates!
G O   S L E E P
The thing weslay likes to lick?
Ok back to funneh mandiballs
I think its gold/dia trophy fish comp and a specific one to viking
A c h i e v e m e n t
Its screaming hint
No other non-crimson isle random achievements were added
He doesnt respond to the fish items
So ur point is gone
Change
Jacob mentioned a change
Herring unlocks giving viking a specific tier of a specific trophy fish to get numbers then donate during plebby at believer and helmet floats up :yep: :yep: :yep:
My crackpot theory :yep: :yep: :yep:
After viking gives u number u donate at believer
I  WILL :yep: :yep:
:nop:
viking viking viking viking viking viking
say no to this RATIO
It doesnt hurt to test viking smh
Viking isnt a shitpost like sulphur evo was
Can we just test it?
2+2=viking 👍
Who here has gold trophy hunter
Put herring in viking furnace
Try some gold trophy fish :prayge:
Trophy fish achievement for viking jskbfkjwkalocksnbebwkskjfjrnjeheuxijenwhajixox
If u put any trophy fish achievement in viking furnace u get a secret achievement
:lead_maybe:
I have the achievement
I hate this hunt. Now i will leave and come back in 10 mins
Back
?????????
Me when sm1 found solution in those 40 mins and its now gone forever:
Ok back to mandible
I have (maybe) proof its not viking
U cant put magical lava in the fire
From viking
And for the furnace step in the ritual u gotta put out the fire first
Maybe the viking achievement is hinting at us to do a nether viking ritual on a different npc?
In crimson isle
Its not
Use a nether viking ritual on Odexar or Odger or maybe even fookin Believer
sekret 👍
Ench lava and mahmafish and herring/trophy fish?
Its the ritual, not viking
Rhanora's dont like fish or equation. Also gave fish and equation to the npc that wants to steal a cat from rhanora.
^ my name :duck_smile:
Nothing works
Im dumb
But ye Corm only teasing next update
Hunt could be finished the day crimson isle was added
These wizards were added 3 days ago
Corm is and always will be  u s e l e s s
Jacob???
Dis we get a :lead: :lead_maybe:
I tried EVERYTHING ON EXISTENCE eith Deng
Mandiballs solved
Ok did Jacob mention Deng or sum shit?
JacobRuby is typing :monkaS: :monkaS: :monkaS:
Me trying not to make a theory from everything jacob says (impossible)
Current bounty for mandible: none
Theres no bounty for the actual mandible tho
S U L P H U R
Its confirmed Kuudra eats SULPHUR
^ my name
Now back to the hunt
No lets just go back to the hunt
I get my life energy from ppl saying that line
Deleting it is killing me
Ok now mandiblin time
We should do Viking ritual on sm1 like Odger or Odexar
But a nether one
Odexar cant fish cuz his leg is broken
:lead_maybe:
In mage quest
I GET IT NOW
ITS ANOTHER METAPHOR
DONT THINK OF FISHING OR WATER NPCS
Its a metaphor like the prvs one
LETS FIGURE OUT WHAT THE METAPHOR MEANS
its prob referring to jake, as in a metaphor
Sm1 give this man hunter
Didnt jacob confirm in vc that believer is the fish part?
Well yes but actually no
Me and carrot did
Ok so let me explain
We get numbers, then donate when plebby, then the piece floats up like herring from the lava pool @tevstio
This isy theory
Arch is chestplate
But chestplate unites the set and arch talks abt uniting
Breh
Yes
IF BELIEVER DOESNT GIVE HELMET IM GIVING THE MORBIUS KID 13B
Nah its prob we donate equation to believer during plebby and we get the helmet like we got the fish
^ Keep this in mind for later
I tried everything possible with deng
Noone
Finally active on topic mandible discussion :peepoheart:
The hint must be a metaphor for jake (jake wont be used in the hunt its just a metaphor)
Carrot ur in special class so ur specially smart
What do u think the metaphor means
Oh u did mb
Odexar cant fish cuz broken leg. Smth similar happened to jake
Mage quest
U bring odger stuff
Odexar party???
Its a metaphor for jake hinting at odexar :yep: :lead_maybe:
I tried most the fish and sm1 brought him all lava rods iirc
No its theory time
I made a whole essay on this
HELLFIRE HELLFIRE HELLFIRE HELLFIRE HELLFIRE
HELLFIRE HELLFIRE HELLFIRE
Epoa ur fishing 50
Give odexar ur rod rn
Pig give odexar ur rod pls
And if he takes
U get edition 1
Its in odexar dialogue that he needs a goog rod
So no hint needed 👍
:lead: :lead_maybe: :hollow: :waah:
Carrot stop imperonating me
WAIT CARROT IS RIGHT
It says not a hint
Admins said we shouldnt overthink
So its as simple as it not being a hint
Mods dont beam me im not shitpostin, k?
Sus
Im convinced its a donation value
THE HERRING IS A TEST KUUDRA GAVE US
and if we do the test we get piece
Hunt doesnt reuse stuff
Hint is very vague
We should forget abt this hint
Ye
Pov: u say s*lphur evo
Ok back to mandible
Any1 with hellfire should talk to Odexar
Who is mollim
Dialogue?
That guy only gives rainbow 2
Goog 👍
Rulenor sus
Odexar
Crimson isle v2 shit prob
O D E X A R
He has bad rod
He has broken leg
Deng
Tried all with those cats
A R C H
Magma cube lvl 100
Pig ur rich
Buy a lvl 100 magma cube on ah
And show to Strux
Strux says magma cubes r forbidden pets
I got it out once
Chaos r u as rich as pig
Do u have 60m to do smth
Pig ur here
Buy lvl 100 magma cube and show to strux
Also to arxh with ember
Yes
Carrot Deng is at a very low point
Also Pomtair, but Pomtair has a use
I tried everything alrdy lol
Duggy stop deleting mssgs
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Bro i went on unofficial wiki and saw 3 ads for sb coins irl trading :hollow:
Deng makes too much sense if tortle guy is right
The blacksmith
Deng party
Also filleting doesnt work btw
I'm also tried
Deng has his head down like a sad person andd says i need to think
Looks pretty mid-life crisis to me
Carrot moment
Jake was just a metaphor
Instead of trting to make deng smarter, maybe try to cheer him up?
Deep. We live in a susiety :sus:.
Make deng happy
Instead of making him smart
Amongoose
Quest where u give turd a toy
Its pretty obvious 🤣
If it has a rep quest it means its just for that
Deng has potential
Heres the twist. We dont.
He looks more like some1 sad
His head is down like a sad person's and he said he needs to think
What if hes thinking about his life choices
Cheer him up? Make him remember?
Make him remember
Wait
:hollow:
What if we do a nether based viking ritual for deng
I will :yep:
. . .
How do we make deng happy
Who dat
Maybe deng likes her? Kooder Mandiballs romance subplot????
Its a romance subplot
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
If its the blaze cave one...
I have the forgotten skull one
Breh
Suus
What if Pam stops at Deng cuz she likes him?
Maybe thats how we make deng happy
SUUS
MAGMAG USED TO MAKE LOVE POTIONS JEHDISLEHJWLXHCKDKBEKSKCJF
CORM IS A HINT NPC
CORM TALKS ABOUT LOVE
TALK TO CORM
LOVE HINTS
I unironically believe in the Kooder's Mandiballs romance subplot between Pam and Deng
Aqua_Phoenix do smth when pam stops at deng
Talk to deng whem pam comes by
@Honkvincible i have noticed aqua in your name
Are you another alt of the morbius kid?
Interact with deng when pam goes nearby
WHAT IF THE PATHS PAM WALKS ONE R LIKE THE THING WHICH COMES FROM EQUATION
He has over 20 alts
Dont call any1 aqua im getting war flashbacks
M A G M A G
its desc is its used in love potions and laxatives
MAGMAG
its desc
Kooder mandiballs romance subplot between pam and deng
Pam and Deng kuudra mandible romance subplot :yep:
And?
Use magmag
Pam is prob in love with Deng
And magmag desc says used for love potions
Pam has a crush on Deng
Pam walks arnd dragontail and stops at deng
We should interact with deng when she is around
Carrot said jacob hint could be an npc  at a low point in life
And deng has his head down like a sad person and i interpretated his saying "i need to think" as him thinking about his life choices
Maybe he also has feeling for pam
Try stuff on deng when pam nearby
When pam walks near deng's house
Try stuff on deng when pam nearby
PAM IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
What if ifs deng
Magmag descripition says its used for love potions
Give it to Deng
When pam nearby
^ my name
?
I suggest you read all of #read-me-first and check out the amazing website by carrot and duggy for updates!
Ikr
Carrot worst mod
Wait is he a mod?
No he isnt
Anyways my name
@Floch
Carrot said it means a low point in an NPC's life
deng
Cheer ul deng
Or get pam and deng together with love potion
A man's shore
Deng
Jake
What if its a metaphor
It doesnt involve jake, but its a metaphor involving him for another npc
But jake not related to hunt
Just the hint
Nothing else
👍
No
Deng gib number
Number put in equation
We donate equation
Helmet comes to us like herring
Kooders Mandiballs romance subplot with Deng and Pam???
Im srs btw
Would be an interesting theory to explore
Arch is the loneliest npc in crimson isles 🤔
Arch is 300 blocks away from believer
Pleb despawns after 70
ARCH HAS BINARY IN SKIN JELSKJSKPWAPNNSBEBEKSLKDNEKSKKD
Arch has binary in skin
But that destroys pam x deng :waah:
Ye sm1 found out that b4 ik
I think we should focus on interacting with deng when pam walks nearby
Corm talks abt love and magmag's desc says its used for love potions
Nah
I dont think stuff outside crimson isle related
Elaborate further on that please.
What happened in last 12h
We have to bring Pam and Deng together for numbers
Yes
Interact with deng with magmag cuz magmag desc says its used for love potions
(When pam goes nearby)
Sm1 said pam sometimes walks near deng
@Honkvincible
(It isnt morbius kid's alt)
Romance subplot
Im doing both
No, its cuz pam stops at deng sometimes and jacob's hint prob means its a low point in an npc's life and deng looks pretty mid-life crisis
Duggy remove my nickname perms b4 i get beamed
remove my nickname changing perms
Pam stops at deng sometime
Try interacting with deng and/or pam with love related items when they nearby
Yup
Not barb quest npcs
Just to access abiphones as a barb
Prob not related to hunt
Buy fire veil and salvage it
:feelsbadman:
Show the mandible to bocaJ
Jacob's hint mentioned a low point in an npc's life. Deng looks like he's going through a midlife crisis. Try bringing him and pam together when pam walks near him. Magmag mentions love in its desc
Pomtair has a use already
Hes a barb facrion quest npc
Yup
She stops near deng
This is even better than sulphur cube to bocaJ
Pomtair is a barb npc quest
And nothing else
Yes
🐵
Ok now real theories pls
Pam no give armor
When we donate equation at believer
During plebby
The piece floats up
Pam too
Try a ton of stuff with deng when pam is nearby
Idk
No reasoning for what step, expected result or why and how it would work
Its hinting at an npc which is in a low point of their life
Deng looks very midlife crisis to me
And pam stops at him
Also magmag desc mentions its used for love potions
Sulphur :waah:
Were forgetting that the stolen sulphur only gets mentioned in mage quest iirc
But dean's dialogue after completing the quest is sus
Mods is it ok to have sulphur theories if they arent sulphur evo?
Ok i had this theory for a long time
What if the fish unlocked sulphur backpack values
Its kinda sus how sulphur is so important
But was never used in the hunt b4 🤔
Check sulphir stuff nbts
Y would my former money making method want Sulphur?
He says it was kuudra
A tentacle monster
Ok so imma say one thing
What if kuudra wants sulphur
To not detransform
Like barbs turn into pigs when not consuming sulphur for too long
Kuudra stole mages' sulphur stash too
Would make sense, if Drakuu, Aviar and Gnyl werent kuudra also textwall = beam????
Duggy u made me realise smth
What if the equation is A CODE
For kuudra followers
(Not the mob)
Elle knows TOO MUCH about crimson isle
Most of sulphur evo was from elle's dialogue
[NPC] Elle: This Piglin got lost!
What if kuudra becomes plebb if it goes too long without sulphur?
And that explains kooder's motivations?
Thats dialogue when u join barb
How can we put sulphur + directionsl derivatives together
So one time sm1 compared crimson isle and sulphur to dune and spice
Where the earthworm produces spice
What if kuudra actually produces sulphur and isnt the result of sulphur?
if you're new here, i suggest reading #read-me-first and checking out the website (the website is also in #read-me-first)
Can we pls get back to quality mandible discussion guys :prayge:
Hunt is self sufficient so i doubt it would be related to that
#general moment, but how much jerry boxes for foraging 50?
If my pet skin investments sell, im doin farmin and foragin with boxes lol
if you're new here, i suggest reading #read-me-first and checking out the website (the website is also in #read-me-first)
Pig will u mention 🐗 in the video?
What happened in last 5h
Backpack full of sulphur?
Thats y i reacted with 💀 lol
Inb4 pig beams u
?
No1 mentioned it
Jacob didnt know that was even possible
Which values did u try?
K
Goog
Are there any other values to test?
Pig where r the values in hunt tested :yep:
Okie
Very interesting
I could see smth similar working
It would be a rlly cool grind for arch tho
Getting it then speaking to him in 2/4 shimmerig light and 2/4 berserker
Gm
The 3 guys who talk abt time travel, but its highly unlikely they are related cuz they were alrdy used for loremaster
Ndksocoojjwidjjfjjendnfhrkwkjsdjjd
Put magical lava there
Ench lava and all of its upgrades?
Pig
Ur rich
Put everburning flame there
Well he has a midlife crisis... :hollow:
Muted mfs doin loremaster be like:
David stop acting like duggy
Y did u delete msg
I got maggie out on multiple occassions
Suus
(The dragontail npc)
And porc
Why is his name in mythic color
Hes not thinking, hes rethinking his life choices
Lol double ping
Rabbit HMMMMMMM
Deng is the definiton of Suus (the npc)
Btw guys
I have collat for drill
Mafin why r u tryin random stuff on deng
Mafin give him sulphur
It could evolve him so he can think better
@mafinam click with sulphur to evolve his mind
Sad
Try spell powder
Rampart Armor
Rampart Quarry
I did all fish stuff with deng alrdy
That would be for arch, but i alrdy tested that
Guys archfiend dice
I got 6 on archfiend and high class archfiend in front of arch
BUT HUNT WAS LINEAR THEN
sm1 try it
Stop.
Its just an image wall
Of random shit
Give deng a stack of magmag
Kill pack magma cubes
Mafin i have idea
Say bocaJ's lines as a chat trigger to deng
@mafinam say bocaJ chat trigger
Imma do it then
I cant log on :waah:
Sm1 say "oink oink the solution is sulphur evolution oink" in front of deng
Power u have divan u lended out
Can i have it for a relic
(I have collat)
(Can overpay)
(Will pay 25m for lending)
Nop
U can buy on ah
Every1 remember this
Were at a point of giving random shit from e chest to deng
Can i use for collat (overpay) and pay 25m - 50m for relic?
Im not hotm 7 lol
Moving npc disappear sometimes
No its a visual glitch smh
This hunt is hopeless :waah:
Overpaying collat for ur divans and paying extra 50m when i get relic (after hotm 7)
Dont beam me pls
Just a smol ad
Yes
Just switch lobbies when cataclysmic ends
Power wats a good collat for divans
Which item
I have maxed gdrag and hyp
Maxed gdrag AND term?
:waah:
@Carrot look at this cold blooded murderer
Can i get it???
David did u get it in the end or no?
Sadge
Power how much collat u want and all conditions that you want for the divans drill?
This is a certified pigicial moment
What if theres kooder follower equipment too
Any1 here?
Any1 wanna talk abt kooder's mandiballs?
Pig alrdy tried
Whats our best :lead: rn
What should be the main thing to test
Ye ik
No new hunt ideas sadly
We should test stuff with deng imo
Jacob hint points towards him
Just explain a little bit
Yes
Also pig u better put BOAR in the video
Pls make a segment for boar
Pig u should mention sulphur evolution in believer segment it only takes 2s to say it (real)
I considered the barb code cuz i didnt knoe what it was at first 🤣
Pig could u try some values u alrdy tried cuz maybe the change made those values do smth?
@ArshaShokri explain whats hinting at that, what is the expected result and the reasoning behind it
It would
At least put some effort and thought into your ideas please
5 mins for hunt, 55 mins sulphur evo shitposting
We should try stuff with deng, jacob's hint is hinting at sm1 that has a low point in their life
To evolve his brain so he can think better!!!! (real)
Try making him un-depressed
Nice grammar 👍
I dont think deng needs to think though
I think hes sad and thinking abt his life choices
He has his head down
Lets cheer up deng
With a nether viking ritual
Pig ur rich af, try everburning flame in the hole at deng's house
Instead of magmafish, a specific gold/dia trophy fish anf instead ench lava i think everburning flame
Pig everburning flame isnt expensive
Its like 40m
Just try in the hole in deng's house
Its 16 flames to craft. 1/100 drop from an extremely rare mob
I can do it tho when ah reopens
Pig
Go on my strange addiction - fishing up psquids
Pig how much B did u lose to believer alrdy
Pig get everburning flame and put into deng's house's hole
I dont think were solving believer b4 the end of the year :feelsbadman:
It has a random hole
Cuz nether viking ritual
Cuz deng also sad
FlochForster
Most likely from drakuu when we do his step
When we have full kuudra follower
After artifact
Drakuu makes so much sense
And hunt doesnt reuse npcs
Drakuu gib artifact when we dewl eith kuudra "the right way"
Drakuu is kuudra
And aviar and gnyl the 2 magma cubes sitting on top of the lava kraken
Deng
He looks like he is in a low point in life, and jacob was hinting at someone like that
About his life choices
He is depressed
Give him smth he likes
So he becomes happy
We have an expert on that!
bocaJ!
My personal theory:
He is a follower of kuudra
And has a herring
And is thinking about the herring
Carrot can i buy your turtle for sb coins
Its cute
What do we do with deng
What if they are in love
Corm hints at love
And magmag desc says its used for love potions
(Guy from ur lobby that was beamed)
What if this ratio isnt related to this step?
What bet?
I made a different bet
If 2 guys at gate arent related to drakuu
The morbius kid gets all my stuff (made 2 months ago)
No
This is what the mandible will say when ee find it
Lets test Deng stuff 👍
We will. Soon.
fihe 👍
Any new :lead_maybe:
Mandible Meeting 👍
Ik wat it is b4 i joined
Did you find the mandible????
But ur hiding that
(real)
The mandible meeting was a joke
I was there (not in gc, but in wizard tower)
B4 server reboot
Try stuff with Deng :waah:
Try love related stuff when pam walks nearby
#hunt-discussion is dying every day
Nothing new in hunt ideas or in hunt tested :feelsbadman:
Does any1 here have any ideas to test?
But they just didnt put in #hunt-ideas?
We know some depressed guy must be involved
Is there any useless npc thats depressed eexcept for Deng
Sadly, I did :feelsbadman:
And equation chat trigger to most npcs
But only for crimson isle npcs
But also to math enjoyer and viking
Trying equation chat trigger on every npc ever would be stoopid
Strux is most likely for Arch
Truu is prob hypixel trying to say smth political but idk could be mandible
Turd and Suus not related cuz npc quest
Is this another aqua's alt
Ok goog
Now back to mandible
Give a stack of magmag to deng and/or pam when they are near each other
Im prob on the list of ppl who go off topic 💀 💀 :hollow:
Oh so only #general conversations are forbidden?
Not saying one #general line
Beam chances reduced
We should move this to #general ;)
Done
I did that like 4 times alrdy
And to pam
And to most npcs
:feelsbadman:
No deng MUST be involved in getting X and Y
Jacob's hint makes too much sense
Deng is more depressed
Odexar just mentions it, but isnt sad about it
Deng is Pomtair levels of sad
If he had this problem
He would react if we tell him equation
Pig should go donate some Deng related values
That would help a ton
I have a conspiracy theory
Pig is donating all these values to be known as the guy who donated most to believer
So ppl know him for that
Not the backpack incident...
Odexar's leg dialogue is mage faction locked tho
Why would he be depressed then?
Jacob's hint relates to
Some1 in a low point in life
Ok why do u think odexar is related?
Just bcuz plhleg was fished up?
Ok now i have the same thing to destroy your argument like for viking
Odexar. Already. Has. A. Use.
So far, only useless npcs were involved
Im kinda convinced he is related now
He gives 80 coins
When u complete his quest
Very random thinv
Mage faction quest
Put 80 and 10k into equation
10k is how much u have to give to rulenor
The weirdest crimson isle npc
They say they are famous then u havr to pay 10k for a photo of them
Like wtf
Me too
Y wouls they use smth only for ppl wirh rank
12k rep in each then talking to arch in 2/4 shimmering light, 2/4 berserker would be the absolutely coolest thing ever
But ruled out and not possible
Did we try bringing a sea emperor to jake?
We should at least try
i and j are imaginary numbers
We should just time travel for mandible after voting barry
No its time to speculate about meloncopter
It HAS to be related somehow
Ok so basically, Deng and Pam
Give deng 64 magmag when pam walks nearby
He renamed himself
@zoz
This is the dummy account
Magmag is hard to get tho
Like a 5% chance from pack magma cubes
Theres a barb npc that talks abt love
And werent there some hints abt love?
Idk if they were
Barb npc talks abt love
Go to Corm
Its sussy
corn
Y mention love so much then?
Its a very random thig
Magmag desc mentions its used for love
What if deng is looking for love and when you help him out he does the equation for you
function 🤓 🤓 🤓
Why strength for fish
If its coords
Its prob fish into lava
What if we cant solve the equation
And need an npc to do it for us
When we do smth for them
Get deng and pam together and then deng rewards us with solved equation
What if deng solves it for us when ee get the 2 numbers?
Drakuu is Kuudra
And Aviar and Gnyl the 2 magma cubes sitting on top of it
There is a random hole in deng's house
Wtfrick
Why is there a random hole in the floor of deng's house
Depressed barb guy
And x ray hacks for the chestplate
D E N G
Deng?
YOINK
YOINK IS BARB NPC
YOINK HINTS AT NETHEREART
Its Deng (probably).
Yoink
Hints at netherwart
Ok but Deng
Arch unites the factions
Go read the latest idea in hunt ideas rn
Its all coming together...
AND SINCE DRAKUU IS KUUDRA
the support npcs are Aviar and Gnyl!
Their dialogue matches up
Pacifist Kooder Run with full Kuudra Follower Armor
@epoa could u get drakuu's piece if the reqs were pacifist kooder run? U cant control urself from killing kooder
Mandible part
Is it a worthy sacrifice? U have to not kill him once, but if u do that u get to rip out his jaw next time
@Honkvincible read the latest idea in #hunt-ideas
Arch and Elle prob related
Aviar and Gnyl are for drakuu
If im wrong the morbius kid gets all my stuff
I would too, but their dialogue makes too much sense with drakuu
And them being human kuudra
Like drakuu
Nah
Drakuu is artifact giver
Silver or gold?
Try talking to odexar
With gold hunter or dia
Were doin believer rn
Im number 1 in xp!!!
Yes
Why should a boar hint be less valid?
But but muh deng
@opolars I suggest reading #read-me-first and checking out the website it'll get you updated on the latest announcements and leads on the hunt!
So no Deng???
Yes
Hes depressed
Jacob hint is sm1 in a low point in their life
Well, bocaJ is...
Read #read-me-first
Its not the wizard portal smh
epoa moment
Or squid hat for plhlegblast
:psquid:
Deng couls also be sad
Tides not high = not optimistic???
No.
Hunt is self sufficient 🤡 🤡
Forgor 💀
Lets focus on deng
Viking alrdy has a use tho
All hunt npcs were useless
D E NG   D E N G   D E N G
Focus on deng and pam
She walks around dragontail
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
but still, D E N G
walk around this ratio
She stops at deng
Ye i said that a ton of times alrdy
I have idea in hunt ideas about it
This isnt hypixel f*rums 🤮 tho
Counter ratio
Your message belongs in #general.
Pam stops at D E N G
try making pam and deng in love
And deng will give us numbers cuz he eill be happy again
Ok focus on viking
Stack of magmag
Its @zoz
I also told ppl to try
But all they so is speculate
I cant, cuz csnt log on
Test viking stuff
I have viking idea in #hunt-ideas !!!
Who here has gold hunter
Gib viking gold fishe
I wanna test magmag and romero and juliette stuff on pam and deng when they come near each other
Viking idea:
I did
But its archived
Ok the idea is no longer archived
Used for love potions
Its desc says used for love potions
Tyvm for testing it
Do u have herring
Same
Even if not deng, im making the 10k words fanfic still
Its too Suus (dragontail npc)
Turd :hollow:
Im in carrot's walls (he stole my explosionless)
Sus
Ok now back to :mandible:
The :mandible: emoji is underused imo
:mandible:
Why no Mandible Chain
Okie
I think elle gives the mandible in the end
Suus (dragontail npc)
Turd (dragontail npc)
Ok now lets go to #general or talk abt :mandible:
No how why. No.
Explain why
Cuz while we fight kuudra she grabs it and steals it? Idk i just said for no reason lol im dumb
Say Believer gives Helmet, Arch gives Chestplate and Drakuu gives Artifact for free magmag fishing gear after u get lvl 27
We donate full equation to believer when plebby then helmet floats up like herring
Ah yes, 6 reactions
Pig alrdy tried that
@Aviex
(We hate ham radio here)
@ShadowPrarYT tf is ur pfp
I see, an intellectual
Pig irl be like: :yep:
xd
Sulphur Progression
Me when u dont know its a shitpost:
I didnt start it?
Viking was established b4 the hint
Lets talk abt mandible now :prayge:
Yay mandible
Ok now that ur here
Lets talk abt mandible :prayge: :yep:
No
NO
NOOOOOO
Paying ppl to mine netherrack on my account 10$/h
I dont even care anymore
This is the worst update ever
Even worse than museum and dung
*its more just @Floch malding over the nerfs to things atm
You cant use necromancy on plebbies
Same :hollow:
Its the worst part of the udpate
Except maybe gdrag nerf
Sad
Was Sulphur Evolution the solution???
Ok now back to mandible
@Insert Blank Here did u try the gold slugfish yet?
Drakuu IS Kuudra
Now back to :mandible:
Nop :feelsbadman:
Maybe use strength on a block in the bastion?
Cuz mage stuff
How can we get 4k strength tho :hollow:
There is an npc in the bastion
When i was doing the quest
I found some gold block vault thing
And there was an npc telling me i should go
Cant find the npc or gold blocks thi
Tho
OMFG DUKES ARE PROFIT AGAIN
18M PER GNTLT
Wc
Meant to put in off topic :(
Is there any barb npc that mentions power/strength?
Its time for me to go through every barb's dialogue (3rd time now :feelsbadman:) :yep: :yep: :yep:
I will connect deng and/or pam with a bastion block to unlock with strength :pepeselfie:
Although now i believe deng isnt related but pam is the key to the strngh block
Ragnarock axe
Gdrag
Chimera
Necron with perfects
Shouldnt be too hard
Except for the chimera part
Whats not accessible
Highest achievable is 3831
Maybe 2k strength then?
Cuz intel easier to get than strength
Nahhhh
2k strength is just gdrag, no chimera ragnarok, legion 5 all perf jasper necron, valk and some more stuff
2k should be quite easy
Maybe 3k
Equation moment
🤓
Anyways
Back to 2k strength time
How can i get 2k strength
Yes
I did
Ok so @artificialair saw landon who is 99.999% the guy jacob mentioned in the fookin park
This is some hard viking evidence
It was in the park
Thats where viking is
Sadly no
Makes too much sense
Maybe he wearing the gold admin armor
Is a hint
Noooooooo
Viking is dead
@Insert Blank Here
Did u try the slugfish yet?
I have a pug
He is my pfp
Ok now back to mandible! :mandible:
I personally think its a block in the bastion unlocked with 2k strength
For the other 2 numbers
Im convinced its a block in the bastion to click on with a ton of strength
Is there any npc which could hint at power/strength/coords for the block in bastion
When i was doin my mage quest infiltrating the bastion, some npc at the gold told me i should leave
Never since him since
Nop
Doesnt appear on any wiki
He was like a barb guard
But standing
And didnt kick me ouz
Out
4 months ago 💀
Idk if i made it
Imma tell a friend to do the quest who didnt do it alrdy
Tried, but its common and was like lvl 60
Hmmmmm
Imma try aotving and hyping into kooder's fire circle eye thing
What if he's thinking about his life choices
He looks sad
He has his head down
No he's looking down
Like pomtair
Like a sad person
Its to make him look sad
His head is not down in the way that goblins' heads are
Basically deng says i need to think
And has his head down like a sad person
Lemme explain deng first
It looks like deng has a mid life crisis
Hole in his house?
Ok so basically
Jacob's hint mightve been a metaphor for a sad man
And deng is the sad man
Pam is just one of the solutions that couldve been used for deng
Like 4 times now?
Basically, making pam and deng in love to cheer up deng
And then he gives us those numbers cuz he happy he and pam got together
But its not neccessary pam is related
Although deng is sus
The hint couldve mentioned a sad man
So that
Which could mean thinking about his life choices
Pam was just an idea to cheer up deng
And didnt have much hinting at her
Although deng is very sus
Pig what do u think of the idea of a block in the bastion to be clicked with 2k strength
Aviar and Gnyl are way more likely to be drakuu related
If aviar and gnyl arent related to drakuu i give morbius kid 13b
I think we have to cheer deng up
Then he gives coords of block in bastion
And thats how we get the 2 numbers for equation
Very similar dialogue
Drakuu is human kuudra
They are the 2 magma cubes sitting on top of kuudra
1. 🤓
Not that
Drakuu says
We dont know how to deal with kuudra
And drakuu has kuudra symbolism
And aviar and gnyl have the magma cubes sitting on kuudra symbolism
I've been in italy for 1 month, and always hunting :hollow:
Sussy
Drakuu is human Kuudra
Anyways, any ideas on cheering up deng?
U mean hole?
@Pigicial found forum post from march 22th
Hole there
It was on alpha btw
What makes npcs happy
This sounds stupid but...
Give Deng Sulphur
Piglins love it
Ok dont beam me i have an extremely stupid idea rn
Give Deng Sulphur so he "evolves" and can think better
Maybe that will work?
Bruh no
I was serious
Its CONFIRMED piglins evolve from sulphur
Barb duke x is so strong cuz of sulphur
Wat abt spell powder
Or a stack of sulphur blocks
No but rlly, its canonical duke is so strong because of sulphur
We have no confirmation it works plhleg to kuudra but we have that its pig to piglin and piglin to stronger piglin
Tried
Interesting idea
But how?
I rlly wanna sulphurize deng :yep:
Its prob the only way to make him smarter
I am expert on duke
I tried EVERYTHING on him
Pigggggg
Buy a stack of cubes
And gib to deng
U have like 20b nw
Ok who here is rich
Shhhhhhh
Ye but i blew it all on a gdrag
I have no liquid coins
Okie imma do some of my method
I WAS PLANNING ON 1B PURSE AFTER VACATION
I GOT GDRAG 2H B4 GOING TO THE AIRPORT
Tried
Ye tried
Ive tried a ton of things with deng alrdy ;_;
And when pam nearby
Lets shift the focus to making deng smarter
Maybe TIDES ARENT HIGH MEANT HIS IQ ISNT HIGH
maybe it was referring to a dumb person
Sus
Pig do you like Carrot?
Pig donate deng related values
I went broke
I will beat u in money donated to believer when i come from vacation
I have a ton of shit to test
Gimme like 2 weeks to come from vacation then i beat u in money donated to believer :yep: :yep: :yep:
Make deng smort
How can we make him smort
Stack of sulphur cubes
Btw if it doesnt work u can resell lol
Give him the textbook pet item?
Idk
If we make him smart he can solve the equation
Tried
The hint
Either hinting at sm1 sad or dumb
Odexar already has a use
Tides not high maybe means he not smart
Equation hard to solve = deng needs to hint
Drakuu is Aviar and Gnyl
Sussy dialogue
Idk his whole house is very weird
Wait wtf
Y slabs there
Nope
I dont remember the slabs bein there
This is impossible
I found another img
And his house is different
This image is from alpha
It is in alpha
The image i posted
The slabs were in alpha
Yes
That is sus
That had also been on alpha
The missing block
@Insert Blank Here give viking the gold slugfish pls
When can u do it
Reasoning? Expected result?
But jake isnt in the room
Any ideas to make deng smort?
I said that alrdy
Btw theres smth interesting i did when relic lock
Rolled a 6 on arhcfiend and high archfiend in front of arch
Sm1 try is again
Cuz i did when relic lock
Then wat is the tide hint
Pig what
Tysm
I am also commited to deng
And in return he makes vids off it and irl money
Use 2k strength to open the chest with ur fist
Pam prob not related
Kinda sus
When i come from vacation me and pig r gonna compete in domating to the believer
I will beat him
Ye ik
I will be donating stuff that makes sense
I donated 42042042 during first fishing party
Also do u need sulphur ideas?
Listed b4
Mention sulphur evolution once in the video and imma help u with donating values which u wanted to donate during plhlegs
Just say one of the ideas was turning plhlegblast into kuudra via sulphur 👍
:mandible:
Did any1 10 star the alchemist staff
I think that block would be in the bastion
I will
Gimme ideas for blocks
Ok i need to punch Sebastian with 2k strength so he gives numbers
Idk is there any npc hinting at that
Maybe the gold blocks
Theres a lot of gold blocks
In Sebastian
Tf is peggy?
Oh
I will 2k strength all gold blocks in Sebastian
How do i get 2k strength
I only have a clean one
Carrot being smart??? Omg real??
I once saw an npc at the gold saying i should leavr
When doing my mage infiltration questline
Do u mean guard or npc?
No
Maybe he did idk
What npc says that?
Whats the npc called
No not barbarian guard
Those walk around
That one was standing at gold
Jacob pls do it
Corm dialogue
Made me make the Pam x Deng theory
Its a theory that deng is depressed and we have to bring him and pam together then he will be happy and give us numbers
Its not a shitpost btw
37277272727379922019th time saying this
DENG AND PAM ISNT A SHITPOST
Its a genuine theory i have
Deng, Deng x Pam, 2k strength in the bastion
Its basically cuz deng has a midlife crisis
We should bring him and pam together so he happy
And when he happy
He gib nombars
Also pam stops at deng's house
This is the main supporting factor of it
Yup
He has his head down like a sad person and his thinking quote could be him rethinking his life choices
Another theory is
He is dumb
And when he smart he solves equation
Do u guys know the sulphur evolution phenomenon?
Basically, its giving deng a ton of sulphur
So his brain evolves
And he can think better
Were giving deng a stack of sulphur cubes so his brain evolves and he can think better
(Not a shitpost btw)
A genuine theory
Sus
But imma try cuz y not
THROW RANDOM SHIT AT THEM
THIS IS RARE
I HAD TO WAIT LIKR AN HOUR FOR HER TO COME THERE
RING OF TRUE LOVE, MAGMAG, GYRO
JUST THROW RANDOM SHIT AT THERE
AND USE HERRING
AND EVERYRHING
Did u just say dwarven mines?
In dwarven mines
There is Rampart's q
In crimson isle there is rampart armor
Rampart armor is sus
We have divan armor
Divan's gate
And rampart armor
Rampart's quarry
Uhmmm
Pig did u get the cubes from the buy order yet?
Pig give deng the cubes when pam nearby
oh shit caps
Not added until pepper update :pepeselfie:
The fact pam stops at deng the depressed guy out of all ppl is sus
No
All we need
Is jacob coming here and saying
Saying this
No
When he debunked sulphur evo
We got herring in 2 DAYS
Jacob say this when i talk abt deng and pam so we can finish this damn thing
The point is
He debunked a theory
What is our best theory rn
SHE STOPS INFRONT OF HIM
What if its pam and deng
But not love related?
Hmmm
Yes
Lets drop pam x deng
And start pam and deng
It most likely isnt love related
But they are both used
What if deng has one number, pam the other and we the function?
During plhleg
Then helmet floats up like herring
Nah
The helmet will be given to us by Kooder
Like herring
We had a ton of creative ideas (sulpjur evolution was NOT one of them)
And then it was just 4202022 during plhleg
My name was Suwphwur Ewowutwion once
Ok back to mandible :monkaS: :mandible:
What if dive ghasts explosions are powered by sulphur? 🤔
Hm
:waah:
DAVID PING IT
@Hydromoon do u have a cataclysmic lobby
PING IT
David
Plegblast ping
Say herring equation to deng and pam when they nearby
And maybe they give their nombars
Guys i still think we havev to give a terminator to arch
Sadly
Cuz eman 7 is a grind like hotm 7
Term expensive like divan's
And arch = archer
The bow
While wearing 2/4 shimmering light 2/4 berserker?
Ok back to believer now
Bruh
He is human kuudra
And aviar and gnyl
Are the 2 magma cubes standing on hot tier kuudra
This channel is diving into insanity :yep:
Can we now talk abt solving believer :yep: :yep: :yep:
EURIQUTE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Lets focus on believer rn
And how to get x and y
:prayge:
Its not even hunt discussion anymore
Its just random bs
Partially mine
Mandiblin time :mandible: :mandible: :mandible:
We should equation chat trigger on deng when pam comes
Do it when pam nearby
And say equation when pam nearby
:prayge:
Pig did u do it yet?
Pig
Try the thing with deng
Yes
We are giving deng a stack of sulphur cubes
:Pug1:
:armadillo: pig when r u gonna try the sulphur thing with deng
Deng
Hint boar 2.0?
Alts getting hint boar shouldnt count
We need hint boar 2
:hollow:
U know what would be better?
Arch being 12k rep each then wearing 2/4 shimmering light, 2/4 berserker
But thats debunked
Suus (dragontail npc)
Did we get a lead
Im not hunting for that
I just noticed smth
Kid Named Finger:
Y we talkin abt legos again?
:pepeselfie:
Hes very sus tho
Same
What if the lava pools drying up is the change
Maybe its something in the ghost crimson isle
Is it confirmed that no npcs r there
Not even ghost ones
Does pleb pool fully dry out
Are there ghost npcs in other ghost crimson isles
Makes sense, but problem is that he alrdy has a use
We tried that
In a lobby with an explosive active volcano
When it was riaing
The drying up of lava pools is kinda related to the hint
Pool drying up is tides becoming low
Ye but he prob not related
I tested a ton of stuff with aura
Writer is a Quest Npc
For factions
All npcs used in hunt so far served no purpose
Forget abt deng
Park crimson isle has ro be somehow related
This isnt from a new update
Ye
The pools drying up is too sus
Oh no
Thought this was off topic
Pls dont gatekeep ideas there
Type it out here
Pleb
Sadly yes
U cant call odger
@Insert Blank Here do u have the gold slugfish to test or do u need to catch one?
Confirmed not kooder drop
Actually i did
It only gets magmafish
No other drops
I fished there for like 20 mins
The drying out pleb pool
#hunt-announcements
Ok
Its worse than its sulphur evo days 💀
@midoriya_bala_tensa sm1 said fart !
Ok now back to :mandible:
Hyp it
Ok gl tmmrw
Ty for trying 👍
:KidNamedFinger:
What
I never duped
:pepeselfie:
Bruh i never duped
Pam x Deng war flashbacks
. . .
when will pig do the sulphur on deng
Magmag desc says used for love potions
But id we are to use love, its on pam and deng
@Carrot go test if pleb pool accessible to u
Has act 4 been released?
i d k
Its not a fanfiction
Its a theory that deng has 1 number, pam 1 number and we have the equation
And we have to somehow interact with them when they are near each other
Pam stops at deng, deng is sad and tides low could be interpreted as sm1 sad
Why deng of all ppl tho?
She stops directly at his house
Why would they be added?
What do we have rn
What ideas to test
So its not pam and deng?
Im quitting the hunt
If the hint is to be taken literally, the only place where there are "tides" is volcano
And there is odger there
Ye but everything in the hunt so far was in crimson isle
Blazing Fortress is literally old crimson isle
The 3 mage npcs were actually talking about loremaster in deep caverns
No :KidNamedFinger:
Beam !!!!
We got a hint like 10d ago
If the hint is to be taken literally its odger
But why?
Its either a hint for pam x deng (if that exists) or teaser for next update
Ye i did with lvl 200 gdraf
Iirc i had edrag equipped when first talking to him
What
Leg no tb
But its possible i had sheep equipped idk
But ik for sure i talked to him with gdrag
Cant log on im on vacation rn
He talks about love
Anyways
Corm is most likely only a teaser for next updates
Ye
Like a week after crimson isle was released it was completable fully
No u need it
Oh btw theres opal in crimson isle
A gemstone
One of the theories is full gold hunter and a specific gold trophy fish to viking
Y did u get banne
Wdym
did hyp also get nerfed?
Pig which server is the high quality one in
:pepeselfie:
And rename himself to PogoAmongoose on discord
The game isnt allowing you to get slugfish so pogo gets it and gets edition 1 !!!!!!!
Sadge :feelsbadman:
Roe Jiden boar
Pig how much coins to mention sulphur evo once
If the slugfish wont work i will be sad
Me when beamed gets muted and not actually beamed;
I will repay you in magmafish
For ur suffering
I lost 250m or 300m doing archfiend dice and high class archfiend dice
At arch
And i have to do it again cuz i did that when hunt was relic locked :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah:
I hope pig does it this time :yep:
Ye he told me i wont get hunter role on like 8 occassions
Which i know but it still hurts :FeelsBadMan:
Pig can u try getting 6 on archfiend dice and highclass archfiend dice on arch when were doing arch
ITS DEBUNKED LETS GOOOOOOO
The thing i had the most faith in got debunked :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah:
What can we do now :waah:
What part of a squid is its jaw
Cuz the fire circle thing on kuudra looks like an eye not a mouth
The mandible should be under kuudra
This supports my claim that elle gets the mandible for us
Ur ytber ur rich
Donate to pig
So he can test more donation values
:prayge: :prayge: :prayge:
He is
But pig is broke
We need funds
Imma go do my method and get fishing 27 when i come from vacation and test pig's values
Or @Carrot will fish and i will donate
Cuz hes getting lvl 27
Hmmmmmmm
Wait
Gold slugfish made so much sense i will never recover from this emotionally :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah: :waah:
Hmmm
@ jacobruby :pepeselfie:
Fishing parties were fun
Who is mrkeith
Who is that
mrkeith is a gamemaster i thought he was aqua's alt :hollow:
He has like 10 alts ok?
Pig did during the first fishing party
+ european hater + pug hater
Wats ur nw
I have 100h more and 30x ur nw :KidNamedFinger:
Ok back to :mandible:
Rng + investing + 36m/h method
When i come from vacation im selling all of em. I alrdy prepared a menu
I have like 830h with 200h+ bein afk
But tbf i only play sb if i have smth to do that makes money
Not just running around doin random shit
Believer sucks
fishe
Who can i borrow divan's drill from
Have collat
:KidNamedFinger:
David who did u borrow it from
Can i borrow it for collat :KidNamedFinger:
I have lvl 200 gdrag as collat
Can i borrow from them for collat :prayge:
I have lvl 200 gdrag and hyp as collat
:KidNamedFinger:
EURI REACTED WITH FINGER OMG
THIS IS A HISTORICAL MOMENT
Hyp fell in price
Look at my sky crypt how much it worth
Mine is shit i only use it for rcm lol
Wat abt the gdrag
What NPC should we focus on now
Wait did smth happen
Wait what happened
Did we find another island
With pleb pool accessible
Cant rn im on vacation
Whats in the gold mines crimson isle tho?
What are ppl writing off as a bug?
Is the pleb pool still accessible from park and gold mine?
The actual crimson isle?
The real one?
He did? Send me the link of the msg
Is believer a ghost npc there
Cuz he wasnt in the park one
Sm1 should go test rq
If the hint is to be meant literally, its the perfect place
Magmag nbt
Sm1 check it
I think we should try making a love potion in the scarleton potion house somehow
This step harder than prvs 1 fr
We should make our ideas more boring (no im not trolling)
We had so many creative ideas for what to do on pleb and believer but it ended up just being kuudra's return while pleb nearby
Maybe just put stuff together and not think of lore relates stuff
Kuudra's return we took literally and donated for herring
Now lets just take everything in herring literally
the fact that its called not_a_hint: could be taken literally
The equation is the red herring
Although we need the fish still
Just not equation
Hmmmmm
What can we do with herring that doesnt involve the equation in any wqy
FEESHING PARTEEEEEEE
Any ideas rn?
We completes that step  alrdy
What can we do with fish that doesnt involve equation
Do we have any other ideas
What if the thing in the pane is only accessible after u get ur 1st herring?
I meant 1st :KidNamedFinger:
We tried that
What if the glass panes hint is only accessible after u get ur first herring?
And that thats the change
All solutions were more boring than our ideas tbf
We should just take what wr have literally and not look into lore that much
Believer was just release date of kooder
+ squid
We should look into what he have not lore
DENG ANDPAM
FORARCH
What ritual
@Floch can u do it?
Im not doing it
I was jk lol
Thats 1.16 not crimson isle
@Floch DO IT
FOR A HYP
Wdym. Im not @Floch lol
(Alt)
1?
If theres thing on glass, its after 2nd herring
Racist
matpat video: What SULPHUR Is Doing to the inhabitats of the Crimson Isle
I realistically see him making some shit lik that if he'd were to make a mandiballs video
Can sm1 try if herring works rn
Ye we should just work with what we have
Prvs step was just donating kuudra's return when pleb nearby
We should stop looking too much into lore
So taking it literally, i believe the not_a_hint actually isnt a hint
I believe in jungle's glass theory
And that herring has no use
Nah
Completable 1 week after crimson isle added
Kuudra's return -> date of crimson isle
not_a_hint -> not actually a hint
jacob is here
jacob is the herring thing a bug
breh
him not making a statement about it makes me feel its not a bug
this is kinda weird
i have a feeling it isnt a bug
cuz for the ghost crimson isle jacob said it isnt intended
this whole herring thing confuses me
why did no1 confirm its not bugged or is bugged
no1 who tried got it
then y did jacob not say anything
like for the ghost crimson isle
i dont think its bugged
if it were jacob would say its bugged like ghost crimson isle
how did ppl get into ghost crimson isle
i cant even get to ghost spider den
then y didnt they patch the herring
i meant abt herring
thats just a video of herring not working
why the fuck is pam in a house now
jugnle's glass idea
i have more pam & deng stuff to test tho
yes
all of that
i tried all think and math related stuff on deng
i think his thinking is him thinking abt his life choices tho
sm1 with big brain 5 on their helmet should talk to deng rn
im surprised pig didnt do the sulphur on deng yet
imma test it ig
wish me luck im losing 21m rn
PAM IS AT DENG RN
ok i made the buy order
16.5m
WHAT DO I TEST WITH PAM AND DENG
PAM IS AT DENG RN
I WAITED 40 MINS FOR THIS
/boop flochforster to join the pam and deng lobby
pam is gone
she wandered away
pigicial
did u test the sulphur on deng
theres a hole in deng's house
i went through a lot of dragontail houses
deng's is like falling apart
deng looks mentally unstable to me
his house is falling apart
because of his insanity of needing to think
also carrot can i give the dolphin to jungle for a bit
deng's house is extremely messy
although theres another explanation
theres a dragontail aspiring architect who made a weird house for herself
maybe she made deng's too?
idk
but deng's house weird
i see viking parallels
we have nothing else to do while herring bugged
and hint could be reffering to deng
carrot has it rn
he cant log on until tmmrw
bro even the dragontail banner on deng's house has holes
this is extremely weird
just log on and see
deng looks like a madman
with a house falling apart
his house is literally missing chunks of it
wtf
btw pam lives very near deng
HE WANTS TO FIX HIS HOUSE
THATS WHY HE NEEDS TO THINK
:pepeselfie:
yes
her job should be right here?
DENG IS SO NEAR PAM
deng's entire house falling apart everywhere is such a strange detail to add
i just went on the forums and. . .
another picture of slabs missing at deng
the image has no slabs
pig
did u try the sulphur on deng yet
64?
:KidNamedFinger:
Any1 have ideas i can test
Do I?
dog
Tortle :KidNamedFinger:
I have 1 daily finger to use
Any1 have ideas for me to test?
Any1 have ideas for me to test
It means jaw
All hunt npcs were completely useless outside of the hunt
Aranya has a use
Gimme all ur ideas i have a 30m budget and logging in in 10 mins
Herring bugged rn
I would do that when the idea was published, but herring bugged
The potato guy has a use alrd
give me a reasoning behind it and expected result and i'll do it
if its under 30m i'll do it
ok i made the buy order
ok when its filled imma do it
i only got 20 so far 🥲
mafin send me a visit request i wanna see bocaJ
ur online
i did /g online
@Rigner lets gooooo 215 potatoes alrdy
out of 512
no potatoes in 15 mins :feelsbadman:
should i just instabuy and lose 3m
ok placed
49 more
50 MORE POTATOES :yep:
i said i got 49 b4
i got 153 rn
i need 50
THE ORDER IS FILLED @Rigner
name it careor
deng is sad
and his house is wrecked
any1 have any ideas for me to test rn
tell me
deng makes sense then
no
with this criteria, deng makes sense
i alrdy tried the 64 sulphur cube
smth epoa said was interesting
kooder being a parasite, leeching off the forgotten skull's corpse's sulphur
and the forgotten skull producing sulphur
The Calamity is its name according to Corm
but we shouldnt focus on lore too much
all solutions were straight forward and related only to the dialogue and hints
pam is at deng rn
/boop flochforster to join lobby
but nah i dont thing its pam
i think its deng, but not pam
ye but the forgotten skull is also very near and 3 lines b4 he calls the dragon skeleton Jythar and a he
the wiki lied abt gdrag having 20 base mf not 10
pam still there btw
theres a mage npc waiting for her friend
thats sus
Aviez
For odexar, viking and deng
In the reasons might not be related
Put that they alrdy serve a use
Trophy fishing
Gold trophy hunter and a gold trophy fish to viking
Waiting
There is an npc at the cathedral
Waiting for their friend
That could be related to herring lore
BACKPACK ON HEAD
i had the page open ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
this is a weird thing to say
Cyndarin's dialogue
it isnt
weirdest crimson isle npc
it has a weird use
this guy does nothing
he 99.9% isnt related cuz he has a use and faction locked
deng fits the hint
why is there a colloseum in dragontail
it serves 0 use
he needs to think and equation is scary math
why is there a colloseum
not that
the colloseum has no use
deng just disappeared
deng's entire house falling apart is a weird detail
he has a use alrdy
+ his quest is faction locked
what could deng's house falling apart mean
it is
come to his house
what could deng's house falling apart mean aaaaaaa
the roof has chunks missing, there r slabs on his floor, a block missing in the ground, the opening is destroyed and his dragontail banner has holes in it
the protestors are most likely for the drakuu step and they fall into the human kuudra theory
"Kuudra is just like us."
more proof of Drakuu being human Kuudra
drakuu is hinting at being kuudra
If its a red herring why would jacob point us to it so much?
Jacob typing :monkaS:
Counterratio
Oh wait jacob here
IS HERRING BUGGED
No hint
Just anwser me
IS HERRING BUGGED OR NO
JACOB NO1 CARES ABT THE HINT IS HERRING BUGGED OR NO
Just tell us if herring is bugged
Just that :prayge:
Jacob is herring bugged or no
Tell us
HINT
BOB OMB
Is the hint
(real)
JACOB IS HERRING BUGGED I WILL GIVE U 3M IN SB IF U ANWSER ME
Ok
Ok hmu when i log on do /boop FlochForster
All i needed was that
Now i can continue
I have money in bz
Me giving jacob 30m will solve inflation
Im at the store lemme log on like 5 mins
Oh no what have i caused
I just wanted clarification on the herring thing
I need 11m rq will sell a gyro/ice spray for 11m (20m lb for each)
Or jacob will death me on high pickle
I forgor i spent all my money on potatoes
Ok good
Gyrokinetic Wand
I could sell the livid i gave carrot ystrdy
Need 6m loan will give ice spray/gyro
For collat
U give me 6m i give ice spray i give u 6m bsck u give ice spray back
I need 6m to pay jacob
I have 24m rn
Idk
Dooks
I bribed him to clarify if herring was bugged
Then he will death my profile
Oh no
Bruh stop saying i should scam him
No
Can sm1 check if my profile still there :hollow:
Im back at the hotel now
3 mins until i log in
I wanted to take jacob's soul but am too much in debt
I am in debt to jacob
Im giving it rn
I am speedrunning getting to the hotel room
Just gotta open mc
Visit me for 11m gyro
Im on
Jacob boop me
7m icespray
Jacob im ready
@Chaos_Filter the gyro??? U interested?
7m
jacob im ready
i cant trade u
jacob where do we trade
i have the 30m
the trade is done with mafin
idc if i got scammed
i can get the gyro in 1h of duking
jacob u booped me
what do i do now
i have the 30m
funny mandible man
idk
ok now that ik herring is bugged it should help
funny mandible man took my gemstone gauntlet funds
Ok logging off for the day, tell me tmmrw what i should test
Barbs and mages are only now aware of kooder
But the kooder club (the hunt npcs) know kooder's history
Nope
We shouldnt think of it as lore related
All solutions were straight forward and only related to the step's npcs abd items
Nope
MODS PING IT
HAVE HYP AND GDRAG COLLAT FOR DIVANON
No
Its a relic ping
Wait i forgor to ask jacob if they are making snail fortune back to 400 from 150
Or is it a perma nerf
Lets gooooo
Its netherrackin time
Jacob i could pay u 300m for friend add cuz  it helps a bit with inflation :pepeselfie:
Ok now back to mandible dont beam me
I will add him to a private server and inv u so u can use here
What if the hint isnt reffering to a sad person
Maybe its literal?
Why would it be tho
It was a bug
We tried things during a explosive volcano
Ye, me, pogo, dwagoon, tevstio and tenatian
Were testing stuff
I aldry tried filleting it
Odger doesnt give a f abt herring
We did a lot of stuff during volcano
And diving to magma boss in burning volcano does nothing :hollow:
I paid him -_-
Proof i paid him:
I didnt bribe him for a soul :hollow:
I bribed him so he told us if herring is bugged or no
Just wanted to confirm it xd
So ppl wouldnt speculate its related to the hunt
And its nice that theyre fixing it
No jacob confirmed its a bug
When i hit 1k playtime all my friends will disappear into thin air :KidNamedFinger:
Dont be mean. Its lore, just not related to the hunt
funny looking z
Wtfrick :boomboar:
Wtfrick spy accounts
Who is the spy
The dragoon's cousin guy is confusing
Nah lets not speculate abt it
Back to :mandible:
What if bocaJ is a spy account
I did that
Any1 have stuff for me to test
Carrot dont dare you ping me
Also any1 wanna collat divan's for hyp/lvl 200 gdrag
@Carrot
:pepeselfie:
Tried
Carrot this is the 3rd time u pinged me
I had to block hunt bot -_-
Where did he say that
There is one?
Carrot lied then
Since plebby is fixed we should make a feeshing partee
For the glass test
We have to do that
/boop FlochForster to join
Now
how do i turn it on
bro i just got carrot syndrome
i crashed 2 times in 4 mins
my bank deathed ystrdy 💀
can test when i get some money
i did but then i bribed jacob and lost it all
minecraft
I CRASHED AGAIN
oh i just froze

/p join rigner for swag fishing party
/p join rigner swag fishing party
join swag fishing party /p join rigner
aviez join the party
didnt he make it?
who wanna join the swag fishing party
3482 coins
"have we tried evolving a plhlegblast with sulphut" :J_Nerd1:
/p join rigner for swag fishing party
maybe we can get fishing slaves if pig joins or smth
:waah:
does he also have loot tables of mobs so its confirmed the pieces and hunt related items arent mob drops
lets goooooo
so when me meet the conditions like pleb to believer
the piece is guaranteed?
this makes the hunt more fair
pig pls make a fishing party its the only way ppl will join
when i made 1 every1 left
I thought this gm was aqua's alt :hollow:
2 weeks ago
Back to :mandible:
Isnt ragnarok some norse mythology destructive event?
Worth a try imo
ok im paying 300m for the hitn now (real)
i thought mrkeith was aqua's alt a few weeks ago :hollow:
lets pfish to test jungle's theory
tried for all dragontail and scarleton npcs i could find
ye in hand
but not all crimson isle
just in scarleton and dragontail
patience
an npc is waiting for their friend
at cathedral
and has 1st time dialogue
no
i paid 30m to jacon
to confirm it
we should :yep:
yes
lol
deng
dont spam
wtf
was that
Deng wave supremacy
pomtair is a barb rep quest
all npcs had no use
that were related to the hunt
faction locked
counterratio (all npcs related to hunt have no other use)
my use is annoying you :pepeselfie:
fishing party'
carrot said its here
so the 30m helped
WE GOT A HINT
arch the npc
@mafinam bocaJ said hint
GIVE HIM A LVL 100 MAGMA CUBE PET
LVL 100 MAGMA CUBE PET LEG TO ARCH
lets take "Kuudra would be impressed!" literally
jungle ur becoming me talking abt sulphur evo
its arch now
sulphur evo 2.0 lol
also log on
for dolphin
united
sm1 do it
i have a 500k midas
how much does applying cost
lvl 100 leg magma cube
to arch
☠️ PartDoggo was crushed.
talk to arch with legion 5 rekindled ember
☠️ PartDoggo was crushed.
again
what is a batchest
ye idk how to relate fish with arch
its huntin' time
sirih is faction locked
so not related
except lore
(the lore is sulphur evo)
i tried sulphur on all barb npcs
idk
any ideas rn?
what if u made no friends?
Suus
(dragontail npc)
its not shipping
its just connecting them
Dwagoon
check dms :waah:
*deathing
arch is high up
he has low tides on shore
what if Aviar and Gnyl are their own step
and not part of Drakuu
counterratio although u didnt even ratio me lol
hello mr i-thought-u-were-aqua's-alt
did jacob ever visit u?
he visited me tho
Mindcraft
i was in debt to him and he visited me to collect my debt
Mindcraft indeed
wtfrick @jekobrubee ping????????? beam??????????????? omg? )real?
no ur mindcraft
:boomboar:
yes
this isnt mrkeith
this is aqua's alt !!!!
dog 👍
4 emojis perfectly show the hunt: :lead: :lead_maybe: :hollow: :waah:
:Pug1:
wait i havent used my daily finger yet
:KidNamedFinger:
You got a Common Finger! Next time you can use this command is in 24 hours!
kid named boar
i have jacob soul
that better
I hate you, I lost the game
what should we do with arcj
the tides hint was 99.999% arch
goog song
best classical music type song
jacob when hint give: :lead: :lead_maybe: :hollow: :waah:
hunter chat leaked
and hunter vc leaked
ok we have hint
its Arch
what do with arch
this is pure chaos now
its like cowshed
what with arch
everyone likes boar multiplier
what if we have max ppl for legion to work in ember armor all with legion 5 on all pieces
its just a burning memory is the mandible hunt in a way
backrooms boar
bump
he is high up
so tides low
👍
didnt bearded say
that jacob didnt want to differentiate between believer and arch
and that herring completed believer?
in a VC
"aqua's alt" trying not to say Mindcraft (impossible)
he said mindcraft 7 times today 💀
y arent u aritheboar anymore
its a joke based on me thinking he was aqua's alt when he joined the server
keep the pfp tho
it was rlly good
the boar one
its archin' time :mandible:
any1 have arch ideas
im 99,99999% sure the tides hint is arch
what
hm
averag no longer mod :waah:
how can check for aqua's alts now
what
david was very goog mod
i only hunt more
now that believer is done
i had so much to do with arch
i just hope carrot doesnt become a mod
great
im afraid of what would happen to me if carrot was mod
dragoon only said barry shit
u were very goog mod tho
averag can u still see the join logs
then the inevitable is coming towards ohd
some mod needs to check
hes waiting 2 weeks for the new to discord msg to go away
so he can join
and no1 will suspect anything
he says he has an army and i saw him make 5 alts today
his intentions are interacting with me on those alts a ton
also he has an alt with fledgling but im not diving into that cuz its prob a scheme by him for me to harass fledlings looking for him and getting beamed
ye ik
he doesnt have a fledling alt
its prob a scheme for me to harass fledlings and get beamed
mutual servers and mutual friends and mssgs in cowshed check completed, not aqua's alt
eh imma stop talking abt him until the 2 week period hes waiting ends and he sends in 10+ alts he showed to me and are confirmed to exist
wont mention anything until i see 10 new accounts coming in at the same time 👍
wat abt tmmrw, its 7:30 here in italy rn
hmu when im online
party me when it says FlochForster joined in guild chat
gtg now
gl with arch y'all
Believer is a fookin red herring
Why did jacob have to tell us to do believer :waah:
Just saying this so mods dont kill me, there is also a chance he isnt a red herring
Hey aviex to u want money so u can hunt better
You will get money when all skins sell
I am
All of em
Anyways dwagoon is getting hunter b4 aviez
Now back to :mandible: :mandible: :mandible:
The carrot boar!
If its a hunter set its gold
evolve
Donate all the fish on odexar's wall to funny viking man
Oh wait
We doin arch now
How can i hunt
Ok imma test it
Ok
Btw
Odger said he has a crush on the barb fisher
But thats only dialogue in barb questline
I tried all that except magma cube pet
Wait ember didnt have fire prot
Tested
+ jacob didnt know it was possible
Its debunked
Cuz jacob didnt know its possible
Hm
Should we completely drop the herring?
And make a new start with arxh
can u show the dialogue
there are multiple outlaws?
so thats what happens when they eat too much sulphur
more proof
guys i made a buy order for the mandible
y do some ppl call it greg
i can use it now
its sellin' time
oopsie
give arch loremaster stuff cuz his skin netherrack and magma idk
i tried all kooder npcs and dragontail npcs and scarleton npcs with equation tellign to them and holding herring
dont give me hope abt sulphur evo :hollow: (goog and useful format tho)
kuudra prob returns only when its on a shortage of sulphur
kuudra came stole sulphur, then went back to forgotten skull
no it needs it to survive
its not about evolving
what if
like barbs turn into pigs
kuudra would turn into pleb if no sulphur for too long
That could explain why it returns then hides back!
and aviar and gnyl dialogue...
kuudra only wants to live
it attacks for survival
not survive but make a wand
it needing sulphur to not detransform into plebs
could explain its motivations
ye
same for kudura
gn
kuudra returned only for sulphur
then hid back
and elle fished it up
kuudra only wanted peace after getting sulphut
and would go steal some more in a couple decades
do we have info how much it stole
hm
kooder wants sulphur so it doesnt deevole into a pleb
S L E E P
hm
this kinda hints at kooder wanting sulphur to survive
so it doesnt deevolve into pleb
my theory is that the forgotten skull is The Calamity
what
heavy purples are made of sulphur?
what if matriarch produces sulphur
like worms in dune produce spice
ye but the Recover Sulphur name?
matriarch could be an evolved hellwisp (no im not joking but i understand if u wanna ban me)
@BananaTheBot
Is there a edition 420 alrdy
Cuz im getting mine when i reach hotm 7
3 monthe ago
I will now become a relic collector
tried giving him juju and term
you are a genius
what if he meant it literally
what if the binary in his skin is used
ok done
i wanna test it when kooder comes up from lava
since after he comes out he actually speaks
@epoa can you help test something in a t2 kooder
yes
@FuriouslyFast42 wanna join were testing a spinoff of ur idea
i ran out of mana :pepeselfie:
i will say the dialogue
shut it 😃
does he have term?
carrot ur annoying
imma try divan's on certain blocks
kuuda mandib
lets do the kooder
duggy
reinv me to guild
once again i am asking for the t2 test
lets do the t2 test
omg gib him haunter role!!!!!
can sm1 with hyp and sm1 with term help me do a test
i need 1 canoneer, 1 clearer with hyp, 1 clearer with hyp and term
to test dialogue chat triggers
im shit at clearing
i run out of mana a ton
im the one who will say dialogue chat triggers
when u test my idea
furiously can u help test it
is there a 420th kooder legs?
ok now sm1 find me a cataclysmic lobby
im hotm 7 and can get relic now !!!
where cataclysmic lobby
Most likely the second one
Weve made 0 progress with believer after herring and have no theories
Although tides hint could be reffering to arch 🤔
Arch and believer dialogues are similar ye
FUCK
I JUST GOT HOTM7
How long will this last
I need it
Breh just turne don computer
3 mins for mc to open
This is the perfect opportunity
@Kuanglee party me
Yes
Just hut hotm 7 2h ago
Shit i crashed
Party me
Now
KUUDRA PANTS OBTAINED
now imma do netherrack since netherrack is suprisingly less boring than powder grinding
i subconsciously bought maxed mining setup for funny pants 😐
yes
totally
the fact that archeologist lets u keep the relic is sus
ik ik hunt isnt linear
but the step for mandible is
and maybe even for artifact
imma collect a few extra relics just in case
Dw u can borrow from me
If a mod can trust u i can too ig
So i wont get kicked from the guild if i stop hunting?
Can we do the t2 test now
Its chat trigger b4 and after kooder comes out of the lava
But i need:
- dropship clearer
- mob clearer
- cannoner
Im on cd for relic :hollow:
Oh shit no
Is it aqua
I can next time im online
How much collat
It costed 1.285b
Hyp is 980m
U cant soulbound divanon iirc
I put mine in special items
Im not online nr
I just wanted 420 :hollow:
Ye
i think the arch hint means we should stop doing believer cuz were achieving nothing
and after arch
do believer
kooder gave us herring as a riddle then we donate the solved function to believer when pleb the kooder follower helmet floats up
if infernal was a req
jacob would give some essence hint
patience hint
and is it even worth it after the smol stat boost
infernal meets the herring hint :boomboar:
is there any1 close to infernal
any1 with fiery?
dew it
pls nerf hyp
gm
if jacob gives essence hint reshi makes his armor infernal 👍
nah admins not merciful enough
who ping
im pooder grinding
what is act 4
can we do the t2 test now -_-
ive been waiting for more than a day
i need 3 ppl
1 cannon
1 dropship term
1 hyp clearer (prefferably epoa)
i freaking suck at dropships
the fact we can keep kooder relic is sus
what if the change is that hunt is linear now
jacob never said the change isnt that
so like we had with loremaster
we told him the lines and he gave new dialogue
what if ember armor is nothing but a trigger
no im just saying it could be just a trigger
its first time dialogue
for loremaster
while for arch its repeatable
hm
arch repeats that kuudra would be impressed
so lets impress kuudra
with my t2 test!
(shameless ad)
3rd
i believe that believer either isnt related to arch or is a red herring completely
deng
herring says:
not_a_hint
because it isnt!
okay can we now talk about arch
arch's ember armor dialogue repeats
while crimson isle loremaster's dialogue is once
dwagon in the fookin roles channel it says begging for hunter wont get it for u lol
im leaning towards arch being related to believer now
its believerin' and archin' time
i have some values to test
and done
i gave him term and juju
also his name is arch cuz hes standing on an arch
XD
y
e
s
no its cuz he believes in kuudra
bruh
can we now get serious
gn
me too
okay how can we impress kuudra (through believer and not arch)
give me ideas and imma test
kooder relic
maybe thats the change
imma try
does nothing
sm1 put in hunt tested
WE HAVE TO IMPRESS KOODER AT THE POOL
arch is nothing but a hint npc
tried that when i got mine
wait
lemme try
no longer works
sadge
dwagon u like fishing plebs
lets impress kuudra with donation
multiple kooders
because
they evolve from plebbies
impossible
tried
kooders r plebs who od'd on sulphur
change my mind
:J_Nerd1:
imma gib feesh to bal
BRO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT
but to arch
not believer
btw bal doesnt like the feesh
dwagon that was a bad idea
kooders only exist cuz of sulphur
which was confirmed
kooder only exists cuz of sulphur
that isnt even sulphur evo
just sb lore
i said it because kooders cant live in magma fields cuz no sulphur
ye all solutions were pretty straightforward and only related to dialogue and what the npcs meant literally
so we shouldnt focus on lore too much
what follower
ok now back to impressing kuudra with pleb at pleb pool
ik this sounds dumb
but what if we sacrifice pleb
at magam boss
no at the magma boss pool
if sm1 gets a double hook ive been wanting to donate 8404044 or 2101011
put the pleb in magma boss pool
impress kuudra with a sacrifice
arch + beleiver
i have a new idea
lets test it
#hunt-ideas
what was alrdy done
b4 or after herring
lets retest it 👍
dwagon u like pleb fishing make party
+ it might help with ur hunter role (real)
us sacrificing it would show kuudra we want to impress it
SACRIFICE THE SQUID
i am
on arch + believer
lemme give u my 1b while u test that!
no wtfrick
what if arch is only a hint npc
like alliun
cuz repetitive dialogue
patience
theres a mage npc
whos waiting for their friend
and has first time and repetitive dialogue
also faction xp quest npcs r 99.9999999% not related
dwagoon if u test the squid sacrifice it means u tested smth so higher chance of hunter !!! (real)
make party when u can
srry chaos i was jk
ye lets go back to believer ideas
lets do the magma chamber sacrifice
dwagoon make a party for it tmmrw
in pins it said a single off topic line shouldnt be redirected to off topic
before herring
this conversation is now actually off topic lol
anyways arch
squid sacrifice
i tried blade of volcano
with ember
enrager :pepeselfie:
oh item
i thought weapon
sus flare more expensive than subzero wisp btw
why do u think its a req just cuz its expensive?
ppl think expensive stuff needed cuz divan's
but its just a coincidence bcuz of bp 10
patience
who here is fishing 27
hard
who wanna test thing with plebby
pig we have idea to test
make party pls
phlhegblast sacrifice
ur yt so ppl are like: "omg im joining a yt's party omg!!!!" and it gets more ppl to join
giving pig rank to sm1 else is kinda disrespectful
he can reach the outer lava
ik dwagon
But not tested after herring
yes
outer lava
we didnt test it after herring
outer lava isnt the middle
we never tested it after herring
can any1 fish for the pleb to sacrifice in lava
in magma chamber specifically
ik it was tested but not after herring
i get less than 80k xp/h with most maxed setup i can buy
now back to arch
bro i can mine jade with maxed mining setup
why would i care abt a 2m/h method
HOW
i thought he meant 2m coins/H
did reshirex talk to arch with his fiery crimson?
i dont think its related to kuudra sets cuz hollow is unrelaeased
ye but its not in the game
so it wouldnt make sense to use 4 but not the unreleased ones
imo
Which of these 2 could it be
And how could arch function as a believer hint?
if herring leads to another fish i quit the hunt
and sb
and mc
and life
imma log off soon tell me if u want anything tested
aurora beats storm if it has high level breeze and mana pool + burning tier
bz/lava fishing/kuudra (kuudra gives the least)
1. why would kuudra be impressed by armor recieved from killing it
2. its prob not all 4 sets together cuz hollow isnt finished
its a parasite
not octopus or squid
it lives in the corpse of forgotten skull stealing that sulphur
💀
so its infernal?
party me
WHICH BLOCK CLICK
ITS BOOMING RN
IT WONT LET ME CLAIN RELIC WTF
it wont let me wtf
ye
but u can get multiple
no relic for me
get me 1.3b worth of collat
(It didnt involve sea emperors it was only a metaphor btw)
Sea emperor to jake was a metaphor
Also pfish despawns
All sea emp jake were referring to the same thing
Both
5m collectiob
Ive only mined netherrack for 30 mins in my entire life
any1 have any ideas for me to test while i wait for my buy order to fill
ok which ones
and which protesters
the barb ones or kuudra ones?
@erm what the christmas ?
imma tell the kuudra ones the lines from the barb ones
they might be related
put in hunt tested:
said dialogue of kuudra protesters to barb protesters and dialogue of barb protesters to kuudra protesters
@Carrot
lmfaooooo
can sm1 put in hunt tested it was pain to do cuz i had to keep killing barb guards who kept attacking me
xd
Sm1 should put in hunt tested
said dialogue of kuudra protesters to barb protesters and dialogue of barb protesters to kuudra protesters
he prob was
i think the pieces are: arch, aviar & gnyl then drakuu for artifact
the artifact's ability is literally 50% less dmg from kuudra followers xd
bingo time (pig goes insane)
epoer
we need epoer
wait rlly
show ss
HOLY AMOGUS BALLS ITS CATACYLSMIC
but im on my relic cooldown
@davidamiago FAST LEMME LEND U MY DRILL
he looks like 🤓 + 🐗
ye my theory was sacrificng pleb but thats alr tested
i think arch is magma cube related
idk
maybe it has relations to the magma boss
mrkeith say the line
it was one of the moments of all time when mindcraft said its mindcraftin time
maggie
strux
sea emperor to jake was just a metaphor and was already solved
massive skull
so like it was for believer, arch also says kuudra's return is a future event
WARP ME
ye do u have 1.3b collat
ITS DEAD
1.3b
I think arch and believer are connected
And herring led to arch
Arch talks abt return of kuudra as a future event
Just like believer
Lets do some kooders with necromancy rings in inv
1s
The 1 month anniversary of herring
Uhhhhh how does necromancy work
How do i know i got a soul
No :pepeselfie:
Where would it be? On the ground?
This is one of the aviex moments of all time
Yes
Omfg euri
I thought hes gonna say smth :FeelsBadMan:
Kheharad
What if its a Plhlegblast who ate too much sulphur?
Which is very likely but not related to the hunt since all solutions were straight forward and never lore related
We shouldnt focus on lore
And Jacob debunked Sulphur Evolution himself
Oh ye school starting soon imma ask my math teacher abt function too xd
Kooder Mandiballs arg???
Ok imma leave the server i cant stand TWO carrots
Imma put a 1b buy offer
For the funnies
Ok i found the mandible
Give not_aquwua 11m coins and i will tell u how to get it
Refraction :Yep: quality edition
Golden ball isnt made from sulphur wtfrick
my favourite hunter is dwagoon
Oh wait
He isnt hunter
Since when is DarQ a hunter
Skill issue
Spoiler: not dead and not a nazi
More insanity
Arch doesnt look like he has a piece tbf
I Think Arch is a hint npc for Believer
Didnt bearded say jacob said in a vc that believer solved now and that jacob didnt want do differentiate between believer and arch after herring was found?
Koodra magic
:nop:
All solutions were straight forward and solvable through purely npc dialogue. We shouldnt look into lore too much or at all.
I dont like you
He wasnt related to lore though
Just netherrack and magma cream
law
We should just decode what impress kuudra means, what stands united means and what putting aside our differences means
Waiting for magma boss something something?
Wellllllllllll
Im the guy who bribed jacob with 30m to clarify herring bugged
I have 1b rn soooooooo
I think its an external condition
Ok but why
No it really didnt
Put aside our differences
Wait carrot has a point
Arch is united with the crimson isle
He is literally netherrack and magma
Crimson Isle Communism Arc
Pig wtf
:hollow:
GIVE HIM PAM'S NUMBER
Careor's idea made sense
Arch's skin is crimson isle materials
He is the embodiement of the crimson isle
And watching over it on the arch
Hes made from netherrack and magma chunks not blackstone :pepeselfie:
We must unite with the entire island
Okie
Kooder club isnt corrupted by kooder. They are just a cult
Circled
:troll:
Pigicial, opinion on circles?
Can we now talk about arch and not pigicial's circles
Ok im losing braincells this is enough #hunt-discussion for today
Most sane mandiballs hunter:
Can we talk abt arch now
I tried a ton of bal things
At bal and kuusra and kuudra npcs
l*re 🤮
pig is safe nowhere lol
Poor pig
We can cry :Frog_Cry:
Should i bribe jacob for a hint (i have 1b and i alrdy bribed him once)
Why holding herring tho
eh doesnt hurt to try ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
How?
Never got it lol
I have like 50 magma boss kills
:floppaXD:
:floppaXD:
Ok imma log on rn
What r the reqs again
Ok gimme 3 mins to log on
Im mage faction
shut it jesus
Oh this is gonna go out of context
Shit
Hyperion :pepeselfie:
Sword deal like 500k per hit
Hyp can be used 3 times per second and deals 2.5m each time
We unite with hyp spam
Hyp spam kill barb
jesus is dumb
Ok its archin' time
Lets do pig's idea
Its archin time
Pig when do we do ur idea
Pig when r we doin it
Ok i have all reqs
pig when r we doin it
Pig's big brain idea
We need 10 ppl
Carrot leaked now remove his hunter role!!!
Were currently doing a equation from a fish
But jacob hinted at doing arch
Hunt is non linear so wr could theoretically go for any piece of the armor rn
Weve solved kuudra archeologist and kuudra loremaster so far
And we got a lead from kuudra believer
In the form of herring the fish
Boots, leggings and a fish
We think we have to speak to Drakuu with the whole set
An npc
He stands on an arch in the stronghold
U need 5m netherrack collection and 5m magma cube collection for boots
Btw
Dragoon videos are jokes
Ok so
Accessing deep caverns spanws sponge instead of ores in other lobbies
But sponge is sulphur on crimson isle
So they replaced with netherrack
Duggy i thought u stopped taking metherrack when u got ur boots!
Abt what talon's doing or metherrack?
talon whats the update
Sb?
Moment
david is the new duggy
No
All content released 1 week after crimson isle is unrelated
Were currently solving a fish equation
Its our latest lead
So we most likely need full kuudra follower armor for the mandible
No
We already know there is a helmet
And its texture
2 protestors are most likely linked to drakuu
But if arch and believer are same piece
Then protestors are their own piece ig
Kuudra protestors not barb protestsors smh
What if jaocb only advised us to do arch bcuz were so far off from believer rn?
I also think we should focus on arch rn
We achieved nothing on believer in 1 month and a half
The tides hint could be Arch too
He's standing very high up so tides at him are low ig
U cant fish up the "the fish" items tho
99% that only herring related to hunt and not prvs fishes
Pig when can we test ur 5 barb 5 mage ember
Not many online rn
Pig did u ever donate golden ball release date
We need some type of thing that asks questions from #read-me-first content
Make the thing where no channels visible until you read #read-me-first
Every1 just scrolla through that then "have we tried bringing a plhlegblast to jake???"
The fact magma boss isnt neither barb or mage
Hmmmm
Magma boss equipment set
Scoville belt, scourge cloak, delirium necklace but no bracelet/gauntlet
Contagion is duke
WAIT
contagion is duke drops (barb) and mage resource (mycelium)
I am certified barbarian duke expert with 6k+ kills
Anything else except that equipment and rekindled ember
?
Maybe lvl 100 magma cube pet
*with magma boss
Im logging in
yes
I do
I did
Im mage
Party me
pig party me
Why is pogo trying to kill me with fire
i will do it for the funnies
im putting on whole magma cube equipment set
yes
pogo trying not to burn me challenge (impossible)
i want to roast the duck
bocaJ dialogue chat trigger didnt work
sadge
RELIC PING
im testing smth with pig rn
no
jacob r u alive
carrot moment
talon how can i murder pogo
no its smth with flaming fist burning and derilium
and very incredible!
funny moment
:KidNamedFinger:
@ Pigicial credit us !!!
pig when credit us and put idea in hunt tested
funny purge
Omg so deep can we get 15 likes
We cant be in both at the same time tho
any1 have any ideas for me to test rn
all solutions were straight forward and only related to npc dialogue so we shouldnt look too much into lore or not at all
SULPHUR EVOLUTION
I still think tides arent high is arch
theres also a mage npc which tells ur future from the flames
mrkeith u work at high pickle pls rename mithril to methril
david is duggy v2
missing all relic pings
that message is literally telling us to stop decrypting everything jacob says
did you even read it
it says to stop trying to decrypt everything he says
he just gives hints
hes not a part of the hunt
its a mountain not a volcano
it just has lava around it
what if the lava flows from the volcano to magma fields
:boomboar:
no it flows down from the lava that came out of the top
:boomboar:
i thought u meant magma fields in ci 💀
yes
how tf does a bigass squid visit scarleton and dragontail
and rob the dean's apprentice
ye
rollim
tried calling rollim with kooder pet, molten set, rekindled ember at arch
@Carrot put it in hunt tested
carrot
do it
😠
any1 have ideas for values
ok but what number
sure, im gonna pick up arch and put im in the donation sign
i need numbers
what abt the binary in his skin
for arch ideas i need a group of ppl
so im doin believer rn
carrot pls put that in hunt tested
pig finally sm1 with perms
put calling rollim near arch and then talking to arch while wearing rekindled, molten set and kuudra pet
in hunt tested
i need 4 ppl with burning+ kuudra sets
:pepeselfie:
i meant burning or higher
the 4 towers and ppl stand there while i in ember talk to arch
any other person with perms except carrot pls put "calling rollim near arch and then talking to arch while wearing rekindled, molten set and kuudra pet" in #hunt-tested
ok who here has a full burning or higher set
does a burning or higher fervor even exist
rartmopr
anyways who has burning fervor
:kekw:
does a burning fervor set exist
or burning terror
i need all 4
ik crimson and aurora exist
i need 1 person with each
i dont need all 4
jacob said it
i need 4 ppl each with a set of kuudra armor burning tier
@Chaos_Filter does it need more red
hmmmmmmmmmm arch
arch is united with the entire crimson isle
he is made from netherrack and magma
Who here has full burning of a kuudra set
Arch idea
So 4 small tower things on arch platform
And 4 ppl stand there
While rekindled ember talks to arch
Yes
Did someone say duke?
Imma be getting the duke soul 😎
Im a duke expert
Whats chances for his soul
Its gonna take 1h 30m
But cant get on for 4h
Yo @midoriya_bala_tensa wanna do some dukes we kinda need his soul
To test an idea
My neanderthal brain forgor to take pig's soul when i was in a lobby with him for like 8h
Still need me to get the duke souls?
9 of what?
I think its full set -> talisman -> mandiballs
i found a ring on ah with outlaw for 20m
imma do 100 dukes now
wish me luck
im not doing this
u cant get the soul unless u final hit him
i found lobby with 7 ppl
imma stay there and wait for him to respawn
3h
:Frog_Cry:
3 ppl killing duke there
now
:Frog_Cry2:
IM MALDING RN
everytime its on 1m health some aurora non bozo final hits duke or outlaw
and no duke souls on ah
i give up
ppl think i want his soul to rcm emans
so they got 7 PEOPLE AT DUKE
SO I CANT GET HIS SOUL
voidgloom is kill
just the guy who tps u into kooder fight
not hunt related he alr has a use
its arch cuz hes standing on an arch
its a joke lol
is it from t1 or t2
there might be a difference
try t2
alright so theres a duke soul for like 56m on ah
and a mage outlaw for 20m
sm1 with high nw pls buy it
lets go
lies
i think we should test things with magma boss
what if ember armor dialogue is just a hint towards magma boss
he faked the ss
and im no longer loaning it
lets test magma boss stuff
him being united with the island
he is made from netherrack and magma
i think we have to unite with the entire island
tried calling rollim, dean, ahone, igrupan near arch while wearing ember armor and molten set and kooder pet @ carrot put in hunt tested
the ping was a joke reference
i dont think it involves factions tho
we should think literally on why ember armor impresses kuudra
velyna dialogue mentions a sword with emblems
wait
since magma boss lives under volcano
kooder maybe wants magma boss dead so magma boss doesnt take kooder's sulphur
(No not sulphut evolution btw)
no
no evolution
kooder is a kraken
magma cube is only its texture
why would it impress koodra
arch is also impressed by the set and says kuudra would also be impressed
we shouldnt look for lore based anwsers
because all solutions were straight forward and only dialogue related
so we shouldnt look into lore too much or at all
kuudra wont return until we put aside our differneces
holy shit its bocaJ in his original form
now he evolved into Boardraa
@mafinam
yes he is very real on Mafinam's island
but no he's a joke
we have to put our differences aside before koodra returns
oh god no
:Frog_Cry:
:Frog_Cry2:
pig can go test it
im broke af rn
who here has a full set of burning+ kuudra armor
i wanna test smth
4 ppl with kuudra armor in each tower and 1 with ember talking to arch
person in ember gets it?
faction locked + quest npc so not related
I also wish to be a testing monkey
Pleb die in lava
Pleb not lava kraken
6 minutes
They changed it its 6
Why r u sayin it like its an ingame thing that plebs despawn after 7.2h
All scc's despawn not just plebby
Any1 need testing?
I can be a test monkey
Ok lets do it
ok lets do the kooder run
pig party me
i have everything ready
check my profile viewer
my ign is flochforster
we should get a 4th person
how much is full inv of cubes
who clear
ye ik
put on ember btw
carrot do u have ember
agreed
mine is smth smth 90
how did u make it lvl 100
hm
protesters!
sulphur was never used b4
so this might work
i have faith in it
i tried barb protester dialogue at mage protester and mage protester dialogue at barb protester
also the barb protesters want sulphurcare
i have carrot syndrome
i crashed
barb protesters
gg
@Pigicial
keran and prie
pig was asking for imgs of the house
nope
totally normal house
meanwhile deng's house...............
party me and i show u
pam at deng rn
im always high on sulphur
boaricial
Shit opinions
We should just solve the hunt bruh
No you cant get jawbus' soul and jake was used as a metaphor and is highly unlikely that he is related to the hunt
ik ik hunt was solvable since 1 week after crimson
But jawbus drops bobbin scriptures written by a follower of kuudra
Did believer write it?
Or jawbus?
And right as i decide to take a break from mc, bocaJ drops a new hint
Its huntin' time
I see what we should do with Believer and how it ties in Arch more clearly now
I have a ton of shit to test today
Yay new abiphones
Cant wait to burn money
Herring was a red herring
The blessing + ember impressing kooder
Hm
I think arch and believer same step
Ye i did
But only with cube
Didnt bearded say jacob said in a vc that believer is now done and didnt want to differentiate between arch and believer after herring was found?
No that was after herring found
I think 1 or 2 days later
i misremembered, nothing abt arch
I think herring was the transition from believer to arch
:weirdChamp:
who wants me to be a test monkey for your ideas?
oh come on
1. how was it hinted at?
2. reasoning?
3. expected result?
yes
he did
we should just wait for jacob to tell us to go from believer to arch and arch to believer for months until he stops then we look at all posts from that time period cuz it means we were on the right track
:yep:
A
but mostly C
nop
Kuudra Mandibles
so you can get more than one
:J_Nerd1:
Mindcraft
Magma lord thingy bonus is called Lord's Blessing
And the believer thing is  fishing
Why?
Nothing has hinted at sulphur so far
Ok but why? No indications of sulphur anywhere
Surely the plhlegblasts would be responsive to sulphur somehow?
If kuudra gave them
Can u link the msg -_-
Sulphur would make them resistant to lava not the other way
In all examples, sulphur made creatures influenced by it more adapted to the isle
Proof?
I meant proof that they were influenced by sulphir
So sulphur devolved them?
Wtfrick sulphur de-evolution?
They devolved
Even b4 herring, i always wanted to try making plhlegs lava resistant
Were currently solving a fish equation
The mandible is 99.9999% obtainable only after we have the full kuudra set
Infernal kuudra key
12k
But not to randos
To ppl trusted in the communit
This is why it should be only for trusted ppl
Act 4 leaks
joe much
any1 have any ideas rn for me to test
dwagon go fish and i will donate!
We could also say the fish was a "blessing"
Maybe the blessing is an item
Kuudra also blesses us
So its prob not sulphur
We donate 1m
Its related to the blessing
The solution
he pinged leads and hints with arch
he wouldnt do that if it was just a different npc
then we sucked at it
and now we doin believer again
low tide could also be talking abt arch bein high up
arch and believer not related
now back to believer
i found this first!
also not related to hunt
bcuz hunt was completeable 1 week after crimson isle release
what happened to weslay
gg on hunter!
trophy hunter armor has odger's blessing full set bonus
kuudra's return
we took that literally and donated 4202022
for herring
we should also take kuudra's blessing literally
kuudra will show favor upon us
like with fish
Current information about Kuudra Believer:
should i add/change anything?
they changed things abt the hunt b4 too btw
not just with pleb
anyways what should i add to the list
this is the info list for kuudra believer
arch =/= believer most likely
any other items of interest?
or info?
ye i put that in
magma lord
too far of a stretch
kuudra has shown favor upon us :agree:
kuudra has blessed us :agree:
we did all in believer's dialogue
what does kuudra want now?
im into worse insanity than pig rn
what if
plhlegblast is the blessing
and a projection of kuudra itself
thats why it dies
the pleb comes
and its like a blessing
he makes 4202022 work
updated :YEP:
did any1 who NEVER EVER donated catch up a plebby?
i wanna see
if u can catch one without the "blesing"
it would be confirmation that the plhlegblast is a the blessing
dwagon go fish
imma donate
the plhlegblast might be the blessing
can any1 pleb fish
what should i add/change
. . .
ic
anyways any1 have donation value ideas?
(im donating, ur only fishing)
guys i need donation value ideas
fast
any serious ideas?
dwagon gets credit for fishing, i get credit for donating
bruh
i love free fishing xp
not funny
something random, you are contributing so much to this discussion
👍
back to me needing donation values
chaos do the thing where you tell sm1 to go to off topic
yes
mods put an end to this madness
end this
im losing braincells rn
les goooo
mandible time
Current information about Kuudra Believer:
believer info thingy
I DID
were pleb fishin rn
testing carrot's number
the plhlegblast is the blessing
nah
all kooder npcs appear after beating kooder first time
its kuudra's blessing
frm believer
not kuudra
i think he just wanted us to focus on a different npc for a while cuz we are stuck on believer for 1 month
i think dueces said he has alts here but lets not talk abt that
reshi said it iirc
but lets not ttalk abt it :monkaS:
dueces visited reshi tho
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
no
gib unrefined uwu
oh god mods help
were not killing it
plhlegblast is the blessing
t1 is just killing tentacles
its just attacking kuudra
we need numbers
i need serious hunt ideas
for number
quitters dont get hunter
i just wanna see if it drops smth after the test bruh
Current information about Kuudra Believer:
final time posting -_-
their full set bonuses are named "blessings"
are there any other items of interest?
I did 1m then 4202022 then carrot's number
why would kuudra bless us so we are more encouraged to kill it?
its most likely not related to the fight
we should focus on believer and the blessing rn
how was it hinted at?
i need donation value ideas
8?
aviar, gnyl, arch, drakuu, kuudra believer, kuudra archeologist, kuudra loremaster, kuudra gatekeeper
oh ye thats 8
im dumb
gatekeeper has white name
he alr has a purpose
not hunt related
i think protestors are related tho
they even have barb parallels
both protesting about sulphut
gnyl literally talks about how he wants kuudra to get sulphur
we should focus purely on the blessing rn
i think pleb is the blessing
gib noomber
is pig alive rn
he gibs noomber often
can we get 15 likes?
gib value noomber pls
why
i think kuudra blessed the pool with its presence
the plhlegblasts are a projection of kuudra, completely frail
thats why kuudra's return donated doesnt work unless a plhlegblast aka kuudra is nerby
nah cuz kuudra blessed it
believer says kuudra blessed the pool once
nah i think kooder just gave it cuz it saw we are a follower of kooder
believer says kuudra has shown great favor upon you
any1 have donation value ideas?
yes
we believe he is also human kuudra
no i tried cake souling all the funny hunt npcs
plebby is the blessing
"kuudra's return" donation doesnt work unless kuudra blesses you with its presence
(i believer plebs are a projection of kuudra)
pig gib noombar
odexar alr has a purpose
should i add a npcs of interest section to my believer list
i bad at math can u make that section and i will add it -_-
oh ok
i didnt see the 2nd part
btw do i add odexar to the list or nah
do i add arch
to npcs of interest
should i also add why they are npcs of interest
i dont see odexar being related
updated
match sticks are also odd
sure buddy
should i do the funni kooder run ping
if we tryin
gl
imma close mc now should i test anything or can i go
barry not related
everything after 1 week after crimson released not related
should i look for arch related npcs or believer related npcs
pig should i use the same format for the arch list
Current information about Arch:
we dont have much info abt arch, what should i add
ok but what do i change/add
have we tried fishing in the magma chamber pool
any1 need any testing done?
i have no ideas
well dragons can talk
so
why should kooder speak
ok but how is kooder speaking arch
i need a kooder run test
there has to be some hint npc for arch
archeologist had scholar
loremaster had the 3 mage guys and yoink
believer and arch have nothing hinting at them
some step must be related to fire
velyna and porc dialogue is hinting at something
@deleted-role we're testing aviex's idea i need 2 barbs 1 mage all 3 with rekindled ember and herring
and donate 1m b4 the start of the run
say all kuudra npc dialogue
ALL
jake most likely isnt related  he is only used as a metaphot
cuz i alr have that
ok any1 wanna help me test that
who wanna join
:pepeselfie:
it despawns after 70 blocks
wat
sm1 pinged me
drakuu looks easy
we have nothing on drakuu rn, do u guys have any ideas?
i wanna solve drakuu :pepeselfie:
should i make a drakuu lis
t
i need ppl to help me test aviex's idea
:yep:
can u stop arguing and help me test aviex's idea
you cant go to crimson isle
not combat 24
arch list
Current information about Arch:
what is ur opinion on arch list
i wanna do the funny drakuu secret test
what do i change/add
why would drakuu be full armor
when do we get to test aviex's idea
so arch says his lines in an order
drakuu says them randomly
like a normal npc or the lines after 1st tiem dialogue
but drakuu has no first time dialogue
not sand, terracotta
act 4 evidence
ok back to arch
pig log on so we do aviex's idea
can we now talk about arch
beam him
k party me
ye
me too (i wanna solve drakuu)
aviex's
what do i add to arch list
ok we need 2 more monkes
1 barb and 1 mage
yes
you must
we must fully test the idea
do it
@deleted-role need 1 barb, 1 mage both need rekindled and donate 1m to beliver b4 we start the run, say ALL kooder npc lines in the fight and look around for Arch
swag
pogo when u logging on?
3/4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
need a barb
a barb
i need 1 person who's barb
with rekindled, herring and has to donate 1m
rekindled ember
do u have the herring
we cant live in ember to that point
unless epoer helps us
ok put in hunt tested
this is a fully tested idea
we cant survive in fucking ember
we'd need sm1
unless we clear in storm until that point
ok when epoa logs on we do it
who here can kill a t2 kuudra in ember armor
were doing it up to the point where kooder's face shows up
imagine 2 carrots 💀
i also made a list btw
my list shows current info on arch
my list :pepeselfie:
nah i dont think so
what if unite means the other kooder npcs
drakuu is weird
drakuu randomly says dialogue lines
all other npcs say it in an order
its like were missing a trigger for drakuu
what was loremaster dialogue b4 hunt was non-linear
no smth after u show him pants
when u showed him kuudra follower leggings he had dialogue
when hunt was linear
he said smth like if we met in the past i could give you something
oh
i thought they added the trigger after
im completely out of ideas rn
i dont think you need multiple ppl for arch
should i look in dragontail, scarleton or somewhere else
(for uniting)
what if we have to arch + herring
or arch + 4202022
CORM
i speculated abt corm bein related to arch on day one of ohd
its cormin' time
make pam x deng beamable :pain:
[NPC] Corm: Despite the wars raging at the time, we were still able to unite and beat this common enemy.
corm talks abt uniting to beat an enemy
kuudra isnt our enemy
we worship kuudra
corm is sus
yes dont argue, we need to stand united
for kuudra's return
!!!
pig gib donation value ideas pls
where should i look for uniting
scarleton?
dragontail?
somewhere else?
ive been running around scarleton and dragontail for hours and nothing
no unting npcs
so kuudra will just give us it's jaw?
there is always a condition
cataclysmic
tuesday
plhlegblast
there must be smth for arch
that isnt a condition
its just hidden dialogue
ye but we got nothing from ember
from cataclysmic we got relic
from tuesday we got boots
its not at arch
did u see jacob msg
ember is a hint
a hint for magma boss
i have a horrible idea

[NPC] Eludore: I'm just waiting for my friend to arrive so we can walk back home together.
[NPC] Eludore: My friend should be here any minute now.
[NPC] Eludore: Annyyyyy minute now...

@Xiadie
what i got 3 pings
lemme study believer ffs
arch was just put on the arch
archeologist was tossed at kaus
drakuu was tossed on an arch
loremaster is in the painter's house
but believer has his own area
why are all kuudra npcs tossed around randomly but believer has his own area
and he has a function
you can donate different values for diferent dialogue
believer is different from other npcs
he has this whole donating system and his own area
no
unless you get a hint boar
if you get a hint boar
you get a hint
guys lets go solve believer
plebby is the blessing
we test shit on plebby
were 1 piece away to full set
fishing party now
we have to test
when is jacob coming here
guys imagine
jacob says
we have 3 more pieces to get

i think protesters are related to believer
im now considering sulphur evolution an option
feed the plhlegblast
protesters related to believer
ok?
yes
so now
we
do
believer
!!!
i will eat believer's liver if he doesnt give helmet
pig after most ppl get the piece can u make a fishing party for believer
i wanna get em solved
remove my ugly booster role
veteran color best

we dont know yet
but its ppl at barb townsquare and ppl at mage plaza
jacob
here
Guild > [MVP+] FlochForster: cant wait for the hint man to say its hintin' time and hint all over those guys
/p join ashcon51
he be a depressed boi
:sadge:
most likely no
unless the tides hint meant not a lot of people were looking into arch
duggy had that theory
:kekw:
:kekw:
we need 3 barbs, 3 mages to help my friend get chestplate
/p the_swift
boaryine, duggy had that ideas before you + pig got the first piece
did you ever publish it?
pogo
is jacob
in ur lobby
first time crooryine mentioned it was ystrdy
i got a low edition
ye ik
i got mine 8th
bro aviex log on
get ur chestplate
what how did i leech now
3 at barb townsquare, 3 at mage plaza
were still active, do /p the_swift
/p the_swift for testing exact conditions!
@midoriya_bala_tensa GG On Chestplate!
now go to #deleted-channel and state the edition of your chestplate and your ign!
did we get exact conditions tho
get exact conditions first
give mvp++ to crooryine and 250 to pig
ez fix
i want
maid illager
drawn brining plebby
im deathing rn
crooryine if u get it
give it to jacob
he is selling hint for 300m
hes selling a hint for 300m
buy the hint
epoa ur rich!
jacob is selling a hint for 300m rn
we need to buy the hint
300m
my only coins are gdrag coins
which are like soulbound coins
*1.5m
also make the slander
it wasnt
dont lie
anyways, back to mandible
we need 300m rn
give mandible man 300m
thats was 9d ago
now back to mandible
jacob when is the hint boar hint coming
is it even coming
so true
boaryine should give it to jacob
jacob is selling a hint for 300m
yes
mods should make a fund
where we can donate
ye
and artifact
sad
also nice name
dwagon
we were right
:kekw: 200+ alrdy
its a crooryine alt
banned again
is it guaranteed we will get hint
no gatekeeping kuudra piece is dumb
hmm
ok
its fair for ppl who helped to get low editions
jacob hint
i am malding over edition 8
so you need 3 barbs in dragontail and 3 mages in scarleton
no believer
jacob wtf
is that the x and y
put that shit into the function
jacob you are stinky
are we getting the hint or no
we got a hint boar
kuudra will bless you was for believer
believer is NOT related to arch
dible
we now wait for jacob's believer hint
then we brute force believer like arch
why am i still banned from boarpire
bru
anyways back to mandible
i have 2x better than chaos
have we determined the exact conditions
GG
!
duggy i am proud of you
this is a very good achievement
jacob stinks
did we determine the exact conditions
who deleted my msg and why 💀
pig its only 1 am u can still make fishing party :yep:
test on plebby
plebby is the blessing
ok cya gl with believer i hope u get the funny hint from funny mandible man
will #general be open
oh since we doin believer now i have a believer list
mogus
Do we have the exact way of getting chestplate yet
Back to testing then
Is there a list of everythig that was tested
Also ppl were saying barbs at scarleton and mages at dragontail, so i tped away from scarleton just as i left the plaza ppl started getting it
Whatever the req is for ppl at scarleton, I dont meet the req
The second i tped away from plaza my friend got the chestplate
Had both
Mage
But ppl were saying barbs at plaza, mages at townsquare
And when there were 3 barbs in plaza it didnt work until i left
(Also 3 mages in townsquare)
3 barbs at plaza, 3 mages at townsquare worked
i was at plaza as mage
And when i left
Ppl got it
Could it be that there could be multiple things that work for arch
No
Confirmed not kuudra drop
Imma do it
@jekobrubee
We still dont know the order of Drakuu's dialogue
Ive been wanting to donate that or 8404044/2101011
For so long
Protesters
Believer looks like the least knowledgeful out of the kuudra npcs
If we got a herring in front of other npcs, they'd see kuudra likes us and give us their piece
Believer knows nothing about the pieces
If he had any info about the pieces, he'd give them after seeing kuudra shown favor upon us
Getting herring we were closest to kuudra
Then other steps
I had funny dream where Drakuu gave helmet after catching 50 plebs and believer was a red herring
I love my mandible dreams
2nd so far
I think theres multiple ways to get chestplate
Multiple ways worked
Ystrdy
Helmet theory was always right
I still think theres some hidden req for chestplate
I have a crack theory
The "nothing" jacob said is a hint
Because we have nothing to do with believer
I wanna focus on protesters
No he said an empty msg
Believer is nothing
To solve believer we must do nothing
Because there is nothing to solve at believer
Protesters time
(real)
what are we focusing on now
we should test on plebby
something related to Kuudra's Blessing maybe even the 1m donation
people were saying 3 barbs at plaza, 3 mages at townsquare, then I, a mage leave plaza and my friend gets it
maybe there are multiple solutions
who has donation value ideas for plebby
yes!
it is!
and give me donation values to donate
although i think its mainly on plebby
we should ignore the herring, it says not_a_hint:
if its a hint
then the step should be solvable even if we dont get the hint
its only a hint!
nothing else
2 and 22  wasnt a hint
it was the solution
the function is mentioned as a hint
here it states not a hint
why would it say hint
we need ideas to test on plebby and donation values
ok gib value
im trying
yes
protesters
i made a whole idea about doing protesters
and saying bye to believer
u gave me an idea
drakuu is a Kuudra Follower
from the boss fight
that was most likely from arch
is #8 chestplate good
not related to hunt
bcuz released after crimson
I CRASHED
WHEN U GOT PLEBBY
RELIC
term :pepeselfie:
I DIED
FLOCHFORSTER
Imagine having a divan's drill
ikr
i unboosted for it
bru
can we do 1 plebby
i couldve gotten first one or a low edition but no, i had to check my backpack to see if my jacob soul disappeared
and the jacob soul was in my inv
double ping
:pingsock_red:
:Frog_AngryPing:
:Frog_AngryPing: :Frog_AngryPing: :Frog_AngryPing:
i have 439th legs
some guy has been in hunt vc for like 3h now
i wanna do boots cuz i got 5m magma today
yes
pleb soul to jake, have we tried asking nicely, have we tried decoding everythign jacob ever said
now gib donation value
any1 have donation value ideas
wait kuudra pet is a req?
also gg carrot
We do protestors and believer was a red herring
Funny c
Haha
So funny
Back to mandible now
Is kuudra pet a req
Yes
I had gdrag when ppl got it when i was at plaza and when i got the cp
So prob not req
I saw many different methods worked
Its strange to say the least
I saw so many things work
It wouldnt be a stretch theres multiple solutions
3bt 3mp, 4mt 4bp and whatever it was when we got the first 25 editions
Believer is the worst step
Im malding so hard over my edition 8
Is the lobby alive
Noooo
I was just abt to log on
Mindcraft!!!!!
mrkeith go say the line rn
MINDCRAFT
Have you tried Mindcraft?
i got edition 8
i will never stop malding
i couldve gotten even 1
i was browsing my backpack
when they got it
pogo did
pogo should get 1
so he makes a 10 page essay on anything he wants to and makes his legal name pogo duck
i opened my backpack then pig got it 4s later and i was oblivious until dec1ph3r got it
those ppl who were at plaza and townsquare when the first of us got it are gigachad
i also go to parties and just afk at plaza so ppl get it
#deleted-channel if u wanna make one
parties start there
cya
gn
arch is a depressed boi now
his dialogue when u get chest :pain:
noice
any1 have ideas to test on plebby or donation value ideas?
i waited like 2 mins once and it didnt despawn in lava
(middle of plebby pool)
les go finally some values
it isnt
looks like
balls
we dont know
but its people in ember at townsquare as barbs and as mages at plaza
how did we get confirmation about relic
there has to be some condition we dont know about
there has to
there is some condition
make arch party so we find it
#deleted-channel
ye
there has to be some condition
YES
its only a hint
lets ignore it
it mislead us so much
focus on believer dialogue instead
gm pig
gib donation values
why does pig wake up at 11 am
lets do believer
ye
so ppl can get cp
bur zero arch parties rn
im fishin because there is zero arch party
sm1 make arch party pls
8232009, 8242009
id do literally anything, fish or arch party
big sad
dwagon can we go fish
if lfg ded, every1 here pls go help with arch
👍
arch says traveller
and we travel for cp
believer says adventurer
we need to adventure somehow
:yep:
we have to adventure to solve believer
we had to travel to scarleton/dragontail
dwagon
we have to find the exact condition
we have to solve arch
he's mod
what thing
no not fishing party
we have to test more arch stuff
8232009
8242009
idk
i donate everything
that was me months ago
also arch parties
we have to find the exact solution
i dont remember anything that consistently worked, but i saw like 3 things work
arch time now
pig lemme transfer to u if u comin online
like dwagon said, i suck at organizing parties
also u can make open party
pig
u can open the party
so ppl join easier
we can just tell an amount of ppl to go somewhere
if we have mroe ppl we can just tell em where to go
k when u comin online
i crashed
pogo join us
ye imma party u
epoa fish festival over
now take over the party
:yep:
mafin this is toxic
let others get cp
i reinved him once
👍
mafin
who is party leader
he doesnt want to
give mafin hunter now
great work
we cracked it indeed
yes we, i was in the party for like 3h
I made the fricking party at 8 pm
no more arguing, back to arch reqs
are we sure we have the exact reqs
there was like 10 of us there
yes at arch
like 10 of us there
same
ok believerin' time
now we wait for jacob to go online and give hint

Amy problems
relicus pingus

if he says tides hint its still useful
as we currently believe tides was arch
thx
What
Normal ppl cant ping the role
So it wouls just ping jacob
And yes i know thats the joke
/remove hunter_role @aviex45
@JacobRuby
@JacobRuby
Mindcraft
Oh shit i forgor abt landon
Poor landon
Only for a hint
!!
I love how jacob doesnt have the jacobruby role
im not clicking these ik what they always are
Why is believer like this
Believer was specifically designed to bully us
Ratio because you forgot about veterans
Dueces designing Believer specifically to bully us:
We have devolved into pure insanity
What believer does to a mf
JacobStinky
gn
I AM AWAKE
What took place
What
Wait no1 noticed
Should i go sleep or fish (its gonna be 2 am soon)
Imma sleep for no more than 5h
I wanna fish
K
Gn
Tides
75 times
Hm
What if yall solve it b4 i wake up
I dont wanna sleep
Not neccessarily
No1 said it always occurs at same time
Im thinking of the thing that happened like the moon cultists that appear
Is it sb day based?
It wasnt we alr solved it
Can we convert 4202022 into ingame time
I think smthing happens with believer
At a time relates to 4202022
I made swag idea
Also we should put together blessing + 75 something happened
Wait
What if the blessing happened 75 times
beam.
Is my #hunt-ideas idea swag and poggers
Gn every1
Do we have any clarification if tides was for arch or believer
Should i try putting tides + kuudra blessing + 75 times something happened together :YEP:
Combining literally every single hint to try an piece stuff together
I rlly donr believe believer gives a piece
I think a different npc does
Related to the step
If believer had a piece, he'd see kuudra shown favor upon us and gave us a piece
I thibk the occurence is at the most underlooked kuudra npcs
Protesters
If drakuu is artifact
Where would protesters fit in all this?
i can help i have rekindled and kuudra
im mage
any1 have plebby ideas?
y did u ping my first ever msg :floppaXD:
i have idea
kill plebbo in front of believer with alchemist wand, crown of greed, lvl 200 gdrag with 1b in bank
relates to the purse emptying hint
im gonna reread hunt tested rq
so i see what we did 75 times
i think its sulphur
sulphur was tried the most
what can we do with believer
im deathing over believer rn
lemme kill dwagon scc
dont ping
th
its smth tried 75 times
bru
SKILL LEVEL UP Fishing XXV➜XXVI
so close
then i can become ceo of pleblast
90k xp :pepeselfie:
thats cuz it used to be mineable sulphur
so they changed to netherrack
what if 75 psquid got fished up
also pleb is prob the blessing
what
thatp ingedm e
nice everyone
:Frog_AngryPing: :Frog_AngryPing: :Frog_AngryPing:
:pingsock_red:
what role
MATTEOKA
UR BACK
LES GO
les go
:floppaXD:
what is the thing
did it physically take place somewhere
damn i just wanted to say i think drakuu might be related now
drakuu is prob artifact
yes
we tried it a ton
hm
gm
we have hint we should make fishing party
brute force believer
tried
brute forcing believer as in donating stuff that makes actual sense and testing on plebby and observing around
not just random bs lol
oh im dumb
its meant for faster plebbies
no just like 20 of us pleb fishing
i meant pleb fidhing
lets just make a fishing party for fast plebbies
oh wait we have 0 donation value ideas or any ideas
no pleb until we get ideas
!!!
pig u wanna do all npcs on isle'
?
how many donations would that take
if its 1 donation
then inv me
imma do it
@Aviex donated 1m no new stats or pot effects (but no plebby)
frick
i cant rn
poor clock
pigicial
where is your list
pig
i finished dragontail
(All except the chief cuz i cant access him as a mage)
holding herring, after 1m donated
barb quest
barb rep quest npc where u bring a toy to their child
dwagon afk i think
for 14m
pig go do scarleton i did everything except scarleton
(dwagon afk)
divan drill for 14m (joke)
reminder that sm1 has to talk to scorn im mage and cant access the area
pig we done
every npc
holding herring after 1m donation
no deaths
he did scarleton, i did all other
bro we tried so much on protestors
theyre prob the mandible step
carrot you can mark pig's idea green
i just opened wiki page after speaking to em
nothing changed
hm
i dont like this step so much
but we gotta solve it
it was same for every npc
as on official wiki
i did
barb and mage
i did all except scarleton
dwagon did mage tho
no i said this
i never said barb and mage
yes i was talking to dwagon that i tested barb and mage protestors
(mage protestors at the ones at forgotten skull)
also my next msg was i didnt do scarleton lmfao
they have mage skin
so i call them mage protestors
anyways we did this test any other ideas?
we literally just did it
no shes there in every second lobby
back to believer
:floppaXD:
Mindcraft
Talon based for once? Wtfrick?
If tides hint was for believer and not arch, it makes it seem its plebby pool lava and it would seem like smth that would go unnoticed 75 times
Jacob if youre reading this, clarifying for what npc tides hint was for would be more useful than a new hint :pepeselfie:
Ye we just brought a plebby soul to jake and he gave the helmet, artifact and mandible (extremely real and extremel incredible)
Now back to believer lava
#hunt-ideas
I have idea
it makes it seem like its not smth that happens on a set time like for example loremaster
oh frick i forgor to ask my meth teacher abt the herring function
No
Read this
This one more readable
Imma use this next time
at plebby pool
i have a whole theory about it
:yep:
do you like :isforme:
how can i know
i never saw in hunt ideas
oops i forgor
me big dum dum :2Dumb_Bonk:
we already solved a small part of kuudra believer with herring the fish
believer isnt solved with full armor
he gives armor
les go
:2Not_Cool:
Have we tried looking into potential Plhlegblast Pool lava changes?
like does any1 check the lava?
thats would be our best chance at solving believer :skull:
also "something taking place" could be lava change
pig loves circles
oh ye
deng!
imma theorize about deng a bit more
deng does nothing after u donate 1m
neither does his house change
lava change in plebby pool (tides hint + something took place hint)
we should look into lava
RELIC PING
COCKSELLER QUICK
@ClockSellerSeller
log on
clock
guys can i trust clock with a divan drill
the wizard portal npcs are not related to the hunt.
and she only has some new dialogue when you do it
everything added 1 week after crimson isle is NOT related
yes
admin confirmed it
yes!
i still think its lava change in pleb pool
[MVP+] Cristian0103: I hate aviar
:floppaXD:
do i re-do the 1m to believer and talk to all npc
believer lava being only half a block is such a weird design choice
you cant ember volcano and its full block
its so weird tho
i think we have to make it rise
tides hint!
75 times!
like literally noone would notice if it became 1 block for 20 mins
i rlly hope if jacob would just say "the number went up" once
would rlly help
plebby pool lava did any1 ever check it
did any1 check it after donating
it perfecty encapsulates slayer rng meter
maybe its related to inferno demonlord?
Poll:
i think its lava changing
ITS 80 NOW
HOLY SHIT
IM SO HAPPY
IMMA POST FINGER
:finger:
:KidNamedFinger:
FINGER POSTING IM SO HAPPY
it isnt pleb pool lava
its season change ig
i dont think its time based
i think its smth that you trigger
jacob since ur here...
was tides believer or arch
will pay 1m for anwser
bru i explicitly said 1m so u'd say "10m and done" :floppaXD:
all i can afford rn is 27m
big sad
dwagon but it died
in 20s
jacob i offer you: 27m skyblock coins
dueces made it btw
wait rlly?
hm
didnt jacob say arch hint or believer hint in vc
so believer is prob still needed
i talked to all npcs in crimson isle (except scarleton, where dwagoon did that) after donating 1m
JacobRuby is typing... :monkaS:
ye i was just pointing out that u said "believer hint"
so its believer
and we focus on him
not just slap a different npc with hint
jacob say finger for 1m coins
every1 in ohd be like:
:floppaXD:
nah
i dont think its squids
what happened 5 times
do u remember bearded's list and furiously's list for believer?
we should make a list for this occurence
i meant make a new one with the same format
so we can investigate what happened in those 46 hours
also should i update my believer info list
things of interest in the 46h basically
we should make a fund
to pay jacob the 100m
what npc tides was reffering to is important info
gg
i donate 25m to the fund
duggy should make the fund he manages that stuff
jacob saying if tides was for believer or arch
duggy or some highly trusted mod should start it rn
ok lets ignore it
ye but it could be for either
when he gave it arch wasnt solved yet
ye lets forger about it
me and dwagon
we got 1 plebby that died in 20s
no it died in 20s
jacob if ur lurking
you have an extra boar
use it
now back to :mandible:!
ye that proves it isnt a time based thing but smth that gets triggered
no the occurence gets triggered
i dont like believer
i want believer to go away
and do drakuu
:Frog_Cry: :Frog_Cry2:
Would anyone notice if lava at Plhlegblast pool became full block not half block for a short amount of time?
Does anyone check it after testing smth
Me
How long exacty
Do i need to break it
glowstone respawns very quickly
but something weird i noticed is that it doesnt get replaced by bedrock
it just disappears then reswpasn
i think theres something behind it :yep:
big sad
nothing was behind it
no herring wasnt related to arch
we are just dumb
like with the herring
hm
by accident
if it happened so many times maybe its very simple
if no1 noticed
maybe all the 80 times were "on accident"
what if its as simple as entering a zone after donating 1m w herring in inv
we still dont know how obvious the change is
but its prob very minor
since 80 ppl didnt notice it
i just sold all of mine :floppaXD:
ask bearded
he has em
rift is next update
its confirmed next update
we have item leaks
the disturbance was old blazing fortress
that forum post was made b4 boots were found
Mindcraft
do the ping
carrot
do the ping
ive seen protesters disappear multiple times
signs stay and they disappear
wait is smth happening
in like 3h of grinding i will be able to join you in plebby fishing
deng?
we tried a lot of stuff with deng
nah they wouldnt reuse stuff
i tried some things with arch and believer in a cataclysmic
although cataclysmic happened defo over 80 times
also they wouldnt reuse
in 2 days
not 1
ye
they wouldnt reuse
i hope jacob will update us once like 1h after it happened
theres a person in front of cathedral
eludore
waiting for their friend
maybe it could relate to patience thing
some trigger at eludore
first herring or all my herrings
yes
they could do that
bye bye special item museum slots 😦
k put all mine in
hobo has one they cant put in museum cuz they dont have enough slots
so 105th ig
he put in
what edition we at now?
averag since u tested so many things, whats ur playtime?
Well jacob did say he wont confirm or deny the exact method
Which isnt smth he wouldn't say for legs and boots
Kinda sus
Its screaming "you missed one req you bozos"
Im at 6k
Herring's thing is patience and theres Eludore in front of The Cathedral waiting for their friend
Jacob
Since ur here
Read my name
Nop
No use
It has first time dialoguw
Then keeps saying they should be there any minute
The dialogue resets aftet so time though
holy shi
JACOB
YOU HAVE AN EXTRA BOAR
USE IT
how do we not notice it
:2Dumb_Bonk:
jacob is counting how many hours i have to barnfish to get fishing 27
jacob approximately how long ago did "it" last happen?
im gonna go find it rn
we can solve this today
yes
we will
Eludore
jacob
was tides arch or believer
just that
im doin dialogues to believer
we should all do just dialogues on believer
(in the donation sign)
no not tides hint to believer sign
ingame dialogues to believer sign
also its not herrings
we tracked herrings
what short lines do i put in believer donation sign
i no longer think its about the pool or plhlegblast
if it happened 82 times, its prob 1m + entering a zone
do we take kuudra will bless you literally or should we think about the donation
"Kuudra will bless you." is 1M+
not exactly 1M
updated for the new hints
how do i update believer info list for the new hint
do i add new npcs of interest
and items of interest
JacobRuby is typing... :monkaS:

WHY
WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO US
CAN U AT LEAST GIVE US A TIMESPAN
JUST A SMALL TIMESPAN
this is me rn
look into hunt ideas
look into hunt ideas NOW
we must hyperanalyze them
a few days is like 3 - 5 days
im gonna hyperanalyze everything
wha
jacob was it ever in hunt ideas
PIG?
when he talked abt we have to solve arch to get beleiver hint?
BRUH
me rn
JACOB WHY DO YOU MAKE US SUFFER
DO YOU ENJOY THIS?
we should now all calm down
and sit through pig's vc recordings
:pepeselfie:
ok the solution for the mandible is:
was the idea mentioned only once
wha
what idea
who was in a vc
if you were in a vc in the past few days, react HERE
we need a list of ppl that were in the vc
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
we need this list
no
it isnt timed
its player triggered
it didnt
"on averag" doesnt matter
jacob said we have to notive
its player triggered
bump because we need to know everyone who was in a vc
im gonna go through all hunt ideas in august
one of them HAS TO have something :yep:
jacob said we were very close in august
did anyone mention using numbers from herring as coords without solving anything, just using the numbers in the equation in the VC?
i need to know
there wasnt green on the idea
so i assumed not
huh strange
just went through august's ideas
and there was no common theme in all of em
idk what jacob meant with that we were close
although i found a very interesting idea there
hobo has one herrign that he cant put in museum cuz not enough slots
i donated 1m now i will wait (patience hint) for lava to rise
i did all that
only thing i didnt do after 1m was wait for lava to rise
but i dont have herring in inv cuz its in museum
yes me 4 times
and pig like 50 times
0
well pig prob donated 1m with squid
but i didnt
no
only boots, legs, chest and a fish
no not helmet
tried
we were so close hm
all solutions were so simple once we found them
were overthinking
like we had all these ideas what to do with plebby and believer
but it came down to just being 4202022 to believer when a plebby is nearby
we shouldnt overthink
the solution is prob simple
boots werent
chestplate wasnt
herring wasnt
lets brute force believer it wont be that expensive, most likely the only value needed is 1m and every1 can afford donating 1m once or twice
sm1 did iirc
no were clearly missing smth
thats why jacob wont confirm
Mindcraft
i need this list
a list of ppl who were in vc
ideas ppl said
so i can narrow down the idea jacob meant
what does not work?
pomtair not related
he is a barb rep quest
_with an use_
do i do it :hollow:
24
get fricked carrot
i need a list
nah im just bumping it
Mindcraft
player triggered
jacob almost confirmed it
jacob wanna change the 100m deal to 100m for a new hint?
100m to clarify if tides was believer or arch but i wanna make it to 100m for hint
how is this possible
make a fundraiser for 100m so he gib hint
i donate 25m
i tried to use reverse psychology :pain:
i think its getting triggered by some randos constantly
what did we do that increased it?
how many ppl have herring that arent here
rhanora's cats dont want to eat it
it has to get triggered by randos
like nothing we did did anything
i am now afking at eludore for 1h
cuz they waiting for friend
and herring has some patience stuff
an npc in front of cathedral
they are waiting for their friend
do i donate 1m b4 i go afk at eludore
jacob ping moment
jacob ping has 207 results :skull:
no
but jacob said he was thinking of an useless hint
and it could be for either arch or believer
we should focus on "Kuudra will bless you." and the 83 times something taking place
as the hints are connected to same thing
believer
after u donate 1M+
it could mean we have to take his literally or its related to the 1M+ donation
we dont know yet tho
nice
its used to get herring
we dont know if its used in the later step of believer tho
ppl have world downloads
they'd notice any changes to the map
also jacob didnt go and change any values
herring unlocked a change that was already there
nah its something that takes place triggered by a player
thats our current info on that occurence for now
this is a believer list for all our current info on believer
kk
gimme dates and i will add
done!
we have enough hints to solve this alr
we just need to think
mandiballs cult
no1 confirmed its plebby also before they take you is a joke
im starting to believe eludore is a hint npc for a hint npc (scholar alliun)
maybe the scholar is their friend and eludore is simply a hint for scholar
doing what
also nice texture pack which one is it
i have no texture pack rn
i love being at eludore for 1h
big fun
finga as in :finger:?
do i hold herring while waiting for eludore?
or just have in inv?
this is on topic, im mourning the loss of my progress of testing smth
CATACLYSMIC
I FOUND CATACLYSMIC
WHERE DO I CLICK
You found a Kuudra Relic!
You claimed Kuudra Relic!
first time finding a cataclysmic!
except the time i was in a cata lobby but carrot warped to f3 but we dont talk about that
IF ANYONE HAS IDEAS RELATED TO CATACLYSMIC LOBBY THERES ONE ACTIVE RN
PARTY ME TO GET WARPED
it ended
i want to death
ye
jacob said
say what
@Fing
here he basically confirms it
we put most into museum
around 110
ask weslay for the exact number
nah
we tried herring edition stuff
the thing is most likely player triggered
jacob hinted at that
yes
what
no
jacob is this related to my eludore shenanigans?
ive been stalking eludore
First interaction
[NPC] Eludore: I'm just waiting for my friend to arrive so we can walk back home together.
[NPC] Eludore: Annyyyyy minute now...
patience from herring
like 20 mins then server reboot
now i will be afking at eludore for like 1h
ive been at eludore for like 50 mins now
speak
ITS 91 NOW
believer info list to help
highly unlikely
wait thunders
when did me and dwagon last fish
i have an idea
me and dwagon got 3 thunders on the day jacob dropped the first hint
he has a torn down house and says "I need to think."
tried a ton of mana stuff at deng
new idea - donate 1m at every scc
we have to try
roe jiden! @Aviex !!!
were clearly on the right track
8 times in 2h
i hate eludore
plebby pool lava go up?
no
just me
eludore waiting for friend, herring patience
9 times in 2h
it has to be related to secret plebby testing from guild
bro the entire server combined doesnt have 2 braincells
ok i afked at eludore for 1h and....
absolutely nothing
:pepeselfie:
this is literally my next plan
im gonna use my curse of finding secret lobbies first try to find pogo cuz his party is prob the cause of the 8 occurences
jacob never showed up when it occured tho
hm
what
afk there
and wait for lava change
ghostping???
oh its boar ping
talon were u fishin
did u look at lava change
i afked there for 1h
for nothing...
wat abt plebby caught with blessed bait
what is our best idea rn
to do
abt the occurence
from the fishing parties in the 2h is there a list of scc's caught
why are we pleb fishing is it even confirmed pleb is related to this step
by tmmrw imma be fishing 27 so i can also pleb fish
so inv me to secret parties when i hit 27 :yep:
im like 2h away from reaching it
hm
donating damage?
imma shoot it with alchemist staff, while wearing crown of greed and having gdrag 1b bank equipped then donate damage dealt
also whats a good plhlegblast fishing setup at fishing 27
does shark work for pleb fishing
Ye
koodriballs
Next time ur fishing can u regularly check the lava
If anything changes
on the topic of hint npcs, why were there 2 hint npcs for archeologist and loremaster but none for arch and believer
ye but no npcs hinting at em
so loremaster had 1 hinting at the blazing fortress and 1 hinting at netherwart
archeologist had 1 hinting at cata and 1 hinting at book
is there any hint npc for herring step?
i wanna look into npcs if theres any believer hint npcs since its strange we havent found any yet
just got my relic like 1h ago
no
I tried all npcs with a herring after donating 1m
except scarleton, but dwagon did scarleton with same conditions
I can donate 125m
Is there a list of value to try
I can plebby fish now so i can test em myself
Can we make a fund or smth for the 125m number
Then sm1 trusted donates it
I keep  forgering the 1b bank is gdrag
You dont lose the divan's drill tho
We found a npc
I can do 3934022
I got my entire mining setup and 1b from selling some of my pet skin stash
No taxes involved
Got it all in a trade
Imma go pleb fish now
sailor is most likely just 15 and 2
Prob dono value
So it makes sense now
Sailor's "maybe you can fish up kuudra" is hinting at donating when plebby
Theres a big fish in these waters, maybe u can fish it up or smth
Is his dialogue
"A big fish in these waters"
Did you see any other big fish in kuudra's end
Not magma cube, its a lava kraken
Whatever values we donate, donate them during plhlegblast
Imma pleb fish soon gimme some values
Why are you arguing over grammar can we fookin focus on donation values
Lemme try
I believe the sailor spawning and no1 noticing just some nons randomly donating believer to see dialogue then going into kooder soon after
I dont see how we donated 1m then beat kooder
Why would they make it 125m
Can we organize a non-secret fishing party where every1 can donate because i can fish plegblasts now :YEP:
1b on standby
I wanna pleb fish for the first time ever!!!!!
Drakuu prob isnt the end
What abt the mandible step
Yes lets gatekeep low editions so those that participate in the hunt get them
Ok but what abt protesters?
Its a boat but normal boat deaths in lava
Its time i say it...
Fishing
Party
I no longer leech i can fish now
Lets make a mass fishing party so ez donation testing and ez plebs
me
FlochForster
Logging in in 5 mins
i will
amogus
SKILL LEVEL UP Fishing XXVI➜XXVII
PLEBBIN TIME
carrot am i cool now
Mindcraft
need 2 ppl for a kuudra run, doesnt matter hypm or no, also need ppl for m1 (testing)
i crhased
Do i clear out npcs of interest
@Carrot done
should i add anything to believer list
is the list updated enough
ye i can try
i said that
first
Theres 2 lava pools on the railway system
One below the rails and one at dirt guy
Dwarven mines
Wait weird sailor is in a minecart
Imma investigate dwarven mines
Lava pools
Dwarven railway is the most train related thing in sb
Do i dono 1m b4 i investigate dwarven mines railway
U cant get out of it
m1 time
lets go do it
lol i myself did it over 10 times
i also wanna know what its now
ye xd
any hypm wanna help us test smth in 1 kuudra?
need 2 ppl for kooder and m1 tests
/boop flochforster
wait i have idea now
267m
is it worth trying
i was either in m1 or in kooder
also im not gonna do the 125m
cuz it doesnt make much sense
@Carrot did u crash
we need u for kooder
carrot log on so we can start the tests
i will take squid back if u dont log on 😠
@Crooryine
POLL:
just opninion poll
interesting results
gg
bump need more results
2/8 now
hmmm
Doesnt look bonzo is involved
Although id like to retest that on m1 sometime
we did a ton of bonzo tests
i think the dialogue is just a fancy way to give numbers
back to directional derivatives!
done
@Rigner gg on hunter u deserve it!
its time to directional derivatives herring with 15 and 2 donated at plebby
gib values imma go fish
the watcher bonzo?
any1 have ideas for directional derivatives herring with 15 and 2 that isnt 125m
boar is love, boar is life
ok who here regularly fishes plhlegblasts
ye
what rod do i use what attrbts what enchs what reforge
5m budget
im 27
i cant use inferno
#hunt-announcements
ye
were looking for values of that
@Crooryine ya gonna need this
gn
u dont
that idea debunked
some hunter should put red on it
no way to test
aviex put red on my idea its impossible
like shit
but tbf every1 was saying solution prob wouldnt involve killing kuudra
so i have that in my defense
textwall
u posted it for the 3rd time now
he got it like a week ago
you hunt
which fish guy?
believer?
odexar?
hub fisherman?
ye we tried
theres only like a 50s time window of us having access to him
nah he just give noombers
to donate at believer
we put it in herring function
happy birthday stuffy
When i got into my eludore afking lobby i saw chaos at skull then chaos disappeared
So ye they were most likely doing kuudra
We tried f1 stuff
Looking for him in bonzo boss room, reshi said weird sailor lines to bonzo
Ita prob just a fancy way to give us 15 and 2
It gives a talisman
Kuudra Follower Artifact
Epic rarity, makes u take 50% less dmg from kuudra followers
Mindcraft
Why is there a "Boar." chain but not a Mindcraft chain
The npc was THE change
Sailor just give 15 and 2 can sm1 gimme values of function with 15 and 2 plugged in
I will be pleb fishin tmmrw i need function with 15 and 2 values
What is already donated
2 of what
Wtfrick
What did jacob mean
Was that a hint
Why would there be a 2nd tracked statistic :hollow:
So now we have to get herring, 1m and weird sailor, some other thing and will we even get the helmet then?
Believer is so strange and overcomplicated
So do we focus on putting 15 and 2 into herring function or the other tracked statistic
Coords?
Maybe the other statistic gives the other coords?
No, like -268 Y Z
What if the numbers we would potentially get from the other tracked statistic plugged into Herring function are the Z coords?
Wdym? A sailor hint?
I think sailor's only purpose are numbers
epoa the solution involved killing kuudra :pepeselfie:
You were wrong
You find sailor after beating kuudra
👍 👍 👍
epoa you have problems
Also mandible defo needs kooder to die
The mandible step
I need values related to function with 15 and 2 are there really none ive been asking the whole day
"Are you a believee in the return of Kuudra?" hints at the release date of kuudra although very vaguely
We can
Me too
Also you can resell the drill if u only wanted it for kuudra relic
So what should we do now
That we have 15 and 2
Gm
1/4 kuudra party need to test some sailor shit, /boop FlochForster to join
its for testing not a normal run
still need a hypm for the tests
its 1 -2 kooders
i cant
can sm1 hypm
so i can get this test done
when i hypm i insta die and lose mana
lose mana then die
even with a flux same problem
i get like 4k mana
any hypms?
we have hypm
sm1 join rn so i dont lose blessing effect
need hypm to fully test 1/4
Yes
Weird Sailor dialogue is most likely just a fancy way to give us numbers
But i can try doing things with elephant and lion pets in f1/m1
Not related cuz from new update
Everything released 1 week after crimson isle
Is NOT related
No you need to click the bookshelf b4
See carrot's msg in off topic on how to get 4k intel
Duggy ur mod
Just delete it
Not even an idea or hunt related
I think its just a value with 268
Whats the whole number
2.7b 👍
How do we donate a negative number
:thonk:
Pet levels?
Wth is this step
Ohhhh
Its abt kuudra follower chestplate
We alr solved it, but it means kuudra pet's levels
Yes he said chaos looking at pet levels
I got a mp brz during testing xd
I think sailor dialogue is a fancy way to give us numbers
I think we should focus on 268
Herring function with 15 and 2
Yes
Without
I also did 268999 squidless
I donated everything without squid
Can retest with squid tho
That was archeologist equation
Into archeologist equation
We also put 15 into x and 2 into y this time
And got 268
:pingsock_red:
Were overthinking again
Finding sailor is such a simple solution
I think we just do 268 simple thingy
Imma try the ridiculous helmets
But where
Where do i go underwater
The point of the msg was looking into kooder pet levels for arch
Also weird sailor dialogue is most likely just a way to give us numbers
Arch is solved
Also hunt wouldnt use stuff from other steps
.
Avorius is a mage faction rep quest
Although there could be smth in the house
Ye u can give to Avorius
For 5 rep
Every day
Wolf area?
Where then
Numbers
We shouldnt overthink sailor dialogue, just take numbers
👍
ye
Thats smth worth investigating
Not circus or train stuff
I think its hidden dialogue u can unlock
Flaming chestplate?
Imma try to thibk abt secret boots
plebby?
Sailor?
he wont gib
Mogus
Donate 268, 268999, 26899995
Wait
What if it was 2689995
Look at the calculation!
Me and dwagon got one in 30s then it deathed
Frick its 267999 or 2679995 not 26899999  or 2689995 i forgor
Just use chyme
1 chyme is 500k
And u get 1 per day
i only like 268
what edition
imma get my boots next tuesday i rlly have nothing to do but that rlly
Can i get boots by next tuesday i need 19h of mining netherrack
Typo
5m
I need to do 2,7142857143h per day
Google calculator moment
(How long i have to mine netherack each day to get by next tuesday)
Netherrack is boring, im planning to do netherrack 1h -> smth else for 1h and repeat
What do i do for that 1h
I started rewatching literally ystrdy
Ok 1h metherrack, 1h helmet hunting  and repeat
What except coords could be a negative number
Well i did just make a dh7 fs7 magma rod
So i can plebby fish that time
Im only fishing 27 and i wanna get dh 10 and fs 10 b4 even inferno so i ssve some money
Now back to mandible :mandible: :YEP:
I have a chance to get lower edition than u now :omegapog:
I will get 5m by next week
Pls dont start stalking me too i alr have a stalker
I no longer think sailor is just funi dialogue with numbers
I think sailor is to be solved
What can we even do with just -268?
I thin we gotta solve sailor dialogue
Did jacob say they are related after they were found?
Oh ye 2 and 20
Not 2 and 22
Ppl r focusing on circus too much i dont think thats related
The 15s under lava and mayb you could fish it up are more sus
It isnt
Confirmed that it isnt
Sm1 said a long time ago that we shouldnt think abt new items bciuz they maybe werent yet developed at the time of when the hunt was being made
Thats probably the reason sulphur hasnt been involved and most likely wont be
What abt in off topic?
I think like herring is a riddle that kuudra gave to us, sailor is just a form kuudra took to help us
Because in t1 kuudra doesnt die
We just attack its tentacles
15s under lava, big fish in water mayb u can fish up
We have enough to solve without hint
We just got sailor
Crimson Isle, to get herring
i hate how sailor splits us between "its just 15 and 2" and "we have to solve his dialogue"
i need more results
why is believer such a weird step
so far its such a weird step
did any1 try 267999 or 268999 while plebby
function with 15 and 2
david should i put on THE skin for when i fish pleb
what was it 26799995 or 26799999
ok so david did donate the right number!
now i gotta do 26799995 or 26799999 which one was it
which one was it
i wanna know b4 i do it
i dont rlly need 3 imma give to david or sm1 else i only plan on fishing up one for an noombar
david that looks oddly like ur pfp
ok mandible
i am once again asking if it was 26899995 or 26899999 or 26799999 or 26799995
oh sm1 said smth abt shen
me dumb
we alr clicked him with seal tho
wait lemme buy smth from da then speek to funi sailor
its extremely useful for minion slime afking
268 :catnod:
We shouldnt look into lore too much imo
All solutions were straight forward and we only needed npc dialogue
We needed to beat kuudra in the current step
Weird Sailor appears after beating kuudra
But to see him u have to be blessed (donating 1m )
The effect of the blessing lasts 10 mins
Slightly deeper lava?
Like a block deeper?
No this is important
All lava blocks there f 1 block deep
If this is rlly 2 block this means thats where we can dive
For sailor
We tried things on f1 and m1
U mean bonzo heads?
Ur prob gonna try a ton of things reshirex alr tested so read from 18th of september forward
What was tested in #hunt-tested
So u dont test what was alr tested
i also have that
we got it at the same time
ok now its time for 268
can we talk about 268 now
it seems so strange for believer to give helmet
he'd give it when kuudra shown favor upon us
like arch gives it for just dedication and archeologist just for finding the relic
red
what are some currently untested 268 values
speaking of uncanny
ISTG I SAW SM1 NAMED strangesailor with 2 numbers after it saying typical newbie stuff
like 5h b4 we found sailor
but how b4 we found him?
furiously moment
funneh relic time
p FlochForster
can i trust clockseller
need anwser
ok i can give to carrot then
i can let anyone who doesnt want the drill for any other purposes borrow
yes
collat?
i will take hyp as collat
why
i had to crash
wait
my drill was in menu
will this drop the drill
and destroy it
talon do u have collat
the unrefined as collat
then how can i get to see ur foraging setup :waah:
yes
death
damn
why every1 hating on 268 so much
based jacob
i alr did that
i didnt
no ping
is there multiple anwsers for function
does it give multiple anwsers
:lead_maybe:
wait my theory
floch moment
for archeologist equation
were there multiple anwsers
were the different anwsers for the archeologist equation
can sm1 anwser me
wat was that
when u put 2 and 22 into archeologist equation
was the coords the only anwser
only anwser?
do we get multiple for herring
its in the order 15 and 2
pogo change ur name
so 268 is the only anwser for function
i meant with 15 and 2 :2Dumb_Bonk:
if u get 268
then why is every1 not focusing on it
herring function with 15 and 2
we should still test
can we get our mana down to 268
can we get mana down to 268 no matter our game stage
268 in exp bar?
268 bits?
u get cookie on b z
wdym
did we try 267999 when pleb
and ik there was some 27m number that i forgor about
what was the 27m number sm1 said to test
fishing up kuudra?
cuz sailor said that
where do we fish for kuudra tho
do u lose coins when dying in kuudra lava
smth weird is that having a herring of your own wasnt required for sailor
so finding sailor might not be required for next step
maybe its just his dialogue and/or numbers
ye ik but u can find him without having one of your own
i think sailor is just telling us to do smth from his dialogue
like scholar
without further interactions with him
poll
any1 have any ideas?
sailor says waters and not squid or kuudra but fish
what if he isnt reffering to kuudra's end and kuudra
personally i think by fishing up "Kuudra" he means the plebby
You're now going 2 da circus!
wc
his took up the entire screen
im on computer and it was the whole screen :floppaXD:
did what???
wdym
Can you use grizzly bait as actual bait tho?
Iirc no
:thonk:
No
Old ember is discontinued
So its defo not used
Also we did that alr
:pig:
weslay
Lets combat /hunt sailor
With smth that adds Mindcraft to ur name
K now i say mandible stuff
What is the 26m value sm1 mentioned was there any reasoning behind it?
Lost Adventurer isnt related to hunt btw
Then y u talking abt him in #hunt-discussion
It might make new ppl think hes related
Srry didnt mean to come off as rude
U still need the kuudra runs?
ok imma log on
how many runs?
ok
im back
i can also help with it
what even was the test?
now try smth with f1/m1
he gives 2 numbers, 15 and 2
we believe we have to put 15 and 2 into the herring function
we believe its related to 268
although sailor's dialogue could also be of some use
mainly the train and circus part
we tried things in dwarven railway and f1 and m1
like a lot
you can see how many things reshirex tried in hunt tested
relating to railway and f1/m1
me
thats an ad i made to recruit new ppl
i put in that u cant necromancy on squid and jake was only a metaphor rn
fix'd
what is the bounty  rn
i have to update the pos
t
mafin muted
prob mafin cuz he automuted
more circles pls
not enough circles
more arrows pls and where is an image of the mandible
wat is the exact result of 15 and 2 in herring function
wot
i meant the -267.99999 thing
im a better budget hunter (veteran)
you cannot use necromancy on a plhlegblast
I think the big fish is plebby
And it meand we have to donate a 268 related value when pleb
gn
I think its as simple as a 268 related value at a plhlegblast
Dont forget how simple all solutions have been
We had so many complicated ideas for believer 1st step, but it was just 4202022 when a plebby was nearby
So i think its as simple as a 268 value at pleb
What abt the 27m number
No david tried that iirc
There was a 27m iirc
Were overlooking sailor so much rn
Lets just look for a simple solution
I still believe sailor is only 15 and 2 but fishing up the big fish and 15s under lava is interesting
If its a red herring
Then why did jacob want us to solve it
If herring isnt related
Then we hsve nothing for sailor
It alrdy repeated
4202022 then 1m
What zone is it in
?
We alr have the boots
No
Sailor was unlocked for every1 with the 1st herring
Whatever the big fish to fish up is i dont think its in kuudra's end
You only have like 30s and u cant fish up a rare thing likr a plebby in the 50s kuudra's end is opem
Maybe u insta get it if u fish it up with the condition?
Im in bed (i woke up like 30 mins ago)
Imma try to log on
Im getting my 4th relic
ok im on
who is in lobby
can u party me
where do i click
i always forget
me
i need my relic ;-;
gib lobby me needs relic
no1 joining
ye
its been 7d
nop
IVE PARTIED OVER 10 PPL FROM THAT LOBBY
no1 accepted
im in
where do i click
still on cd for no reason
smh
FlochForster
ye
any1 wanna do the 268 kooder run
268s
how tho
i meant the 268s one
maybe spirit mask could work
but wither cloak and mithril coat didnt
is a 267s run possible
ohg has reqs of hunting and seasoned
we alr know abt the 4k mana bookshelf its used for Kuudra Archeologist equation and its solved
when i was doin runs it seemed like 15 mins
then he disappeared
maybe theres a different factor for blessing length
a common theme in believer is fishing
i think we have to step away from believer for now and fish up the big fish
i dont think the big fish is kuudra tho
wait solution was always obvious and straight forward
im overthinking
big fish is prob just kooder
we just have to do smth with fishing kuudra or elle
maybe its referring to elle
how long does elle have fishing rod in lava
i think its elle
can sm1 help me do elle tests (i'll hypm)
does elle ever have fishing rod in lava for exactly 15s
we should think of a simple solution without overthinking and relating to only npc dialogue
just buy fire veil on ah and salvage it and there u go ez fiber
no rlly
thats how i got it
idk if still works tho
does elle use any bait
did any1 observe that
need help with kuudra fight?
i need to do some runs for observation (im hypm)
literally no1 in guild or lobby joined my kuudra party
hunt is non linear
and doesnt reuse steps
2 and 22 r alr used in archeologist who is solved
theres a small pool by odexar's house
although odexar and his dialogue is most likely not used since he is faction locked and some of his dialogue is faction locked
if theres a barb counterpart
then it makes sense
U need 4.1k mana
Thats 4k intel
Did u try clicking other bookshelfs around it
Huh strange
Last cataclysmic i was about to borrow drill to sm1 but they also coukdnt get the book with 4k mana
Just dm the img
wait maybe giant fishing rod cuz big fish?
frick i forgot giant fishing rod was after crimson
I think its smth with elle (she fishes up kooder)
bean stuffy rn!
Carrot made this one
me too
I think its simple but theres some obscure condition
I think its in the timeframe of elle fishing up kuudra
Maybe sailor hinted at that
What can we do in the time elle is fishing up kuudra
And for how long does she do it
Yes please
We found sailor like 1 week ago
We have a ton to do with his dialogue
We need hints if we get stuck on sailor for a month
Drakuu is prob mandible or arti
Ok dont jacobruby moment me but this kinda looks like theres more to sailor than 15 and 2
stuffy what
Ur overthinking
All solutions were straight forward and only related to npc dialogue
Any other weird sailor anagrams?
gn
Prob not related
Its just his boat
But i have my theories about it being related to the only train related thing in sb
Dwarven Railway
Minecarts also burn in lava
If minecart is related, it has to be somehow related to the dwarven railway which is the most similar thing to a train
ye i think we have to do smth while elle is fishing
stats pipe is defo just a joke and not a part of the hint
We solved the occurences tho
It was sailor
Sea emp hint solved
It was for herring
I also dreamt abt believer but sailor wasnt there. Believer was behind a jasper vein and u had to bring 268 fine jaspers to him for helmerlt
Can u find it in magma fields
The da
4. It just means kuudra and lava
We arent
I think we have to do smth while elle is fishing it up
Hot Bait ig?
If there was bait tho, i doubt it would be actual bait
Maybe somehow use the herring as a bait
(I actually once forgor its from shen update and thought we have to fish up kooder with it)
How could we use the herring as a bait
I mean kuudra gave it to us so
replace 🦆 with :PogoDuck:
Anyways back to :mandible:
I still refuse to believe herring only exists so only the 1st one triggered sailor
It has to have a use
No
You cant use necromancy on a plhlegblast
I opened it once to see if it was updated for arch and sailor 💀
I think we have a limited amount of time to do smth while elle is fishing it up
Enough discord for today
gn
Ye the actual theory should be mentioned
But not the shitpost aspect of it
very funi
Did we try having a water rod in kuudra's end for 268 ticks? (not joking)
Yo new member les go
Faction locked
He alr has a use tho
All other hunt related npcs have no other use
Thats sounds so stupid that it might just work
No
It isnt
.
what did u find
tell us
Unobtainable tho
It was craftable for the 1st few weeks of sb release
Ever since then, its uncraftable
And therefore unobtainable
:nolead:
pogo has one iirc
Unobtainable item tho
Unobtainable for over 3y
Im not joking, but did any1 try crafting a salmon hat with herrings
What u doin with the 268 cubes
oh using sulphur as bait
Thats smart
Pig also try 2 cube, 6 ench, 8 normal
Odexar has a suspicious lava pool next to him
Did any1 try fishing there
Try now :yep:
Odexar has same dialogue for both faction so i think hes worth looking into
K odexar added to info list
Any other stuff to mention abt odexar?
euri's status!
Ok back to mandible
What do i add to odexar
Velyna?
The fortune teller
Kheharad is defo crimson v2 or kuudra revamp
Gives me gwendolyn vibes
Could also sell the mandible after u originally get it idk who knows
no
back to odexar
odexar giving 80 coins is sus
Big fish
Overdone
Soul?
i think sm1 did that
And also thunder soul
When u finish mage quest he gives u 80 coins
he says
Take those 80 coins and dont spend them at once
Big fish should be our main focus tho
Im making sulphur evo v2, making herring the big fish (not a joke)
We also shouldnt overthink
All solutions were straight forward and only related to npc dialogue
Wait do overthink
cuz kooder return --> 4202022 was a large stretch
*7d
based reshirex
You found a Kuudra Relic!
You claimed Kuudra Relic!
oh this is my 4th relic, 438 btw
its funi how i got same leg edition as my discord tag
4
3
9
and artifact
me
if boarthday
how do i get 2.5b museum so i can buy it
that was extremely scuffed but we got it
ye
In t1 it should work since we only attacked its tentacles but idk if we can fish it up after killing it
I think we must show sailor the kuudra fight
what happened was sailor was unlocked at the 1st ever herring
idk but it is like that
we should focus on sailor
look at where only focusing at herring got ut
us
not solving anything abt believer for over a month and a half
yes
also its not an actual bait
i think the next lead (i dont think next step is the helmet) is guaranteed from fishing up in kooder's place under some obscure condition
fish with blessed bait during fight and some unknown condition is my best bet
floch follower set 1st (ur literally my stalker 🙄)
Me like this idea
the red sky to blue sky could be parallels to water and lava
So sailor saying these "waters" mightve not been just "HaHa lOoK Hes SO StrAnge"
Oh no so sad! :supershocked:
Anyways
I think circus and train are meant to be hints for equipment or armor maybe even rod
And we have to use those with blessed bait in kooder fight
Me with my usual stupid stretches, a tier of a dojo belt cuz "training"
But iirc u cant buy em at rusty so any tier should work
In like 2h and 30 mins can sm1 join a kooder w me i need to test smth
I have idea that i will test in 2h
Weird Sailor: let me introduce myself
1st ever herring was prob unlock for sailor
And thats it for herring
Elaborate further
Why exactly *that* number
abandon mandible abandon mandible
mods
make a new channel for this
this one is for mandible
the other one for spooky
guys make new spook hunt channel
hi mods make a new channel for spooky hunt :pepeselfie:
anything found except talis?
rogue flesh defo rogue sword
with so many new ppl were prob solving mandible very soon
need sm1 to join kooder w me we need to beat him (im hypm)
kooder fishing with bozo mask and dojo belt
1 more person :prayge:
ok aviex just left
we need another person
:pepeselfie:
what if combinations is 15 + 2
most sane mandiballer:
breh
arguing is cringe, lets go back to hunting
can i trust reshirex with drill
(Hes givign racing helmet and 200m as collat)
bump
flock moment :2Dumb_Bonk:
now i see i can trust ppl here
no the trusted ppl
the ones who put time into hoonting and would have no reason to scam
jade vein stealer :pepeselfie:
carrot i have decided you can have the drill when its the time
it is not poggers :2Not_Cool:
same
yay veteran content
cool
official or fandom wiki?
No it was the relic  ping
Im mostly on kooder fishing
Thats our best idea rn
Its prob fishing up kooder eith obscure conditions
I still believe herring's only use is that the 1st one ever unlocked sailor and thats it
Very cool and goog ppl will read now and new ppl will be engaged for mandiball hunt
talon got the helmet 2 weeks ago (very real and even more incredible)
Wait thats the real skin of it?
How did u get it
Ye ive been saying bounty needs an upgrade
If we wanna keep the new ppl invested we need a 100m+ bounty
*2h
What if we have to combine all things in sailor dialogue
Into 1 lava fishing
circus: bozo mask, cath train: dojo belt (you train at dojo), 15 and 2: blessed bait,
Are there any big fish items
Are there any train related items
(Dont say minecart i beg)
Imma donate tmmrw this will get new ppl to help us :YEP:
Not goog
Ok this even further makes me think artifact is the 2 kuudra sulphur protesters
Its defo them
Sulphur IS related
Artifact texture is based on it
So it existed when hunt was being made
Aviar and Gnyl artifact defo fr fr
Haha so funny im laughing
Also admin confirmed it if ur actually serious
Mandible texture defo changing after we find it
Tell us still
Artifact is literally kooder tentacles over sulphur cube
Makes me thi k gnyl and aviar are for the artifact
We prob need full set and artifact for mandible
Full set for artifact is unlikely
I think theres a link between kuudra protesters and barb protesters
Ye
Even 4 cubes, 20 ench, 2022 normal
We were doing it cuz we were so desperate that we went to try protesters :YEP:
Anyways was chaos' 125m number tried?
I literally asked if it was tried since it was basically a combination :2Dumb_Bonk:
what was the exact number
ikr!
why that number
hmmm
anyways back to :mandible:
I think its:
wait we did?
can u link the msg
talon got it lol
i hope this hint wont just be smth like just "combinations"
I hope the hint gives as a small idea of what we should do cuz sailor dialogue could mean a lot of things
It'd be protesters, i think they are for artifact
Cant wait for hint boar hint
268 is very yes
:ChaosButterfly: is an emoji for some reason
DENG
i think deng still might be related
Tried
Tried iirc
and smarty pants also tried
Hm
That could mean smth
Theres a condition you have to meet, but when its met the piece is guaranteed
Its no longer bugged (i had to pay 30m for confirmation)
admin confirmed it isnt rng related
isnt that enough proof
You just pinged landon and mrkeith
_W H Y_
WHAT
NO
WHAT THE FUCK
what
what
this is so strange
why did they add new stuff
isnt everything supposed to be alr made since 1 week b4 hunt
what triggered this
So there was some other trigger for that dialogue
but now its changed
?
I was doing the right thing it seems
bozo mask with resp 1 while fishing for kooder
that was the combination
its all coming togethet
Ik ik
But its a part
i always used a dojo belt
as it was obtsined from "train"ing
We dont have the item that triggers dialogue after "mayb u could fish it up?"
We need to get the dialogue
Imma fish up plebby with resp 1 bozo mask
wait no
an item is missing
speak to it with herring in hand rn
The secret part is just the 15s lava part
we only need fish it up
did u try holding herring in hand
this isnt donations
this can be brutrforced
sailor bruteforcing parties rn
I see all of it clearly now
sailor dialogue tells us new reqs to do smth (presumably fish up pleb)
We have 2/3 reqs
try all fishing rods try all fishing rods
with specific reforges
The "..."'s could indicate a line to be solved
So its the secret part and big fish part
we have 2 things to solve
bruteforce sailor with items relating to the words: line 1: SECRET; line 2: FISH, FISHING,
nah
i think we just have to unlock all secret dialogue
and then use all items
while doing smth
(Prob pleb fishing)
isnt it just resp 1
or does it have to be submerged
try all rods with all reforges
we have to bruteforce this
wait yea
"these waters" could mean its a water rod
What fishing reforge would make most sense for fishing up kuudra
Lets get the helmet
imagine we get helmet and its like edition 15
why
Its most likely 1. A water rod 2. With a specific reforge
Also the secret part
thats smth we have to do
Any ideas on the secret part?
hmmm
not supposed to be obtained its a quest item
Somehow it can be put on ah tho
Where do i join testing party
i crasheded
oh great elegant tuxedo
bye bye gdrag bank
same i also wanna borrow tux and give collat
do i buy the tux for 75m
i need when we get all 4 conditions to claim helmet tho
i do
for all 4 lines
im stalking pogo's, talon's and pig's all at once :pepeselfie:
anyone i can collat tux from?
i dont wanna permanently burn 75m
i bought the tux
-75m
death
a>>   Achievement Unlocked: Glass Cannon   <<a
death
bro i just spent 75m on a completely useless armor set
and u complain abt 1m
ye
everything released after crimson isle not related
would it be a lava or water rod
what reforge on rod
and must it be a water rod
anyone kuudra testing party?
i dont wanna my blessing to just run out
what abt this
was this tried
no sea emp souls on ah last time i checked
hm vc
sm1 mentioned stiff reforge on fishing rod
no sm1 said cuz bigger rod for a big fish
any kuudra parties
i have to test smth rq p me ign flochforster
sea emp is defo just a metaphor
what was said in the vc approximately 30 mins from when jacob said the thing
why bal tho
bal isnt a big fish
what abt moody grappleshot its ability is called big pull
maybe it can pull the big fish out of the lava
sadly full
we alr have to wear bonzo mask tho
what kuudra run
i need to do 2 runs to test
ye iirc
i think its a held item
any1 in a kuudra testing party rn?
need 2 runs
talon found a line
so he gets ig
what were some notable things said in vc during the jacob msg 30 mins timespan
any1 one kuudra run i need to test smth
chaos typing in announcements
napkin
any1 kuudra party rq
p me ign FlochForster
im hypm
any1 kooder party rq
inv me too vc ign FlochForster
so does this tie in herring
What if napkin is the thing missing from herring
Can you obtain multiple napkins
Do we have any ideas on what to do
Ye my blessing ench got me 2 then i got that blacklisted corrected msg
Do we know what the obfuscated stuff in napkin is
The 2nd obfuscated thing is only 2 letters
what could be 2 letters
also is its description just weird or is it related to math stuff
so it could be related to herring if its math
Maybe herring got a purpose once we got napkin
its time to do the thing again then
putting all our herrings into museum
So did we find any relation of napkin to herring
Today im organising kuudra runs (im hypm) where u can borrow my tux (need 75m collat) cuz im selling the tux tmmrw
prob
any ideas on the 1st word (i refuse to believe it actually is imposter unless it was in hunt announcements or a mod confirmed it)
letters changing makes it hard to look at is it 7 letters or 8 letters
does that reveal the obfuscateted text
why are the eyes unmarked
they look like amogi
Does it have anything in its nbt
the napkin
What does elbuod mean i never seen that word b4 or is it just double backwards
I dont understand any math but
Could it mean -2
ye that too
I might be overthinking but is the napkin sailor's?
After we solved sailor it makes me think more of the Kuudra Herring Guidr theory
that kooder is giving us herring as a riddle and that herring unlocked sailor so we could solve him and get napkin to complete herring
And sailor is just a human projection of the almighty kooder
The whole believer step is orchestrated by kooder to see if were a true follower of kooder
(my theory not confirmed)
The randomness and length of it 💀
I wanna dry the napkin maybe it mskes the obfuscated text visible
Did we try hyper foornace
I borrow for 75m collat
and do kooder runs as hypm
Although premade, the believer step looks like its making fun of us
I got blessing do its 2x drops thing on mine and it deleted 2nd one
Jacob is just the hint man
dueces made this a long time ago
i think we have to dry the napkin b4 we get to see obfuscated text
Also there has to be some reason the game literally insta wipes ur extra napkins
why would you only be allowed to have one
That would be based
Can i add to believer list that weird sailor is fully solved
Or could there be more to him
dry the napkin dry the napkin dry the napkin
what did we try with drying it
i need a list of things tried
My idea was to drop it in crimson isle cuz crimson isle hot so it dries it but u can get only one so u only have one chance and even dueces wouldnt do that to us
How long
i wanted like 1s b4 it would despawn
@davidamiago is literally gabagool
David try it
Yes
I can loan but with 75m collat
also it would be just in lfg threaf
but no ping
why exactly ice bait and how is a napkin a big fish
Wait (official) wiki said u need to have obtained herring at least once to get napkin
never mentioned here tho
is that true?
@Goat Girl Gwen can u be a test monkey
u dont own a herring i assume
oh
Ok lets do it
Anyways mandible
Lets do the test
need cannoners tho
@mafinam mind if i kidnap(kin) you for a kooder?
finally talon admits to having the helmet (very real)
:follower:
did u find smth?
i rlly hope u dont have to use napkin and that u can keep it it'd be so cool to have it framed somewhere on my island
mine got wiped when blessing got me 2x
floch tux borrowing services, 75m collat needed
i only accept coinage
im on
need to kidnap 2 ppl for kuudra rq
just cannon ppl
(its testing)
ign?
we got funny cat napkin
herring needed for napkin confirm (tested by talon)
kooder eye from t2
it was only used for unlocking stuff tho
i think napkin math stuff will do herring equation or something
2 thing on napkin
tell us
the best edition i couldve gotten was like 30
i got it like 8 mins after chaos posted the thing
i waited up to 2 am and defo worth it
the item literally makes fun of us too
herring desc saying "was it worth all this" and napkin says hang in there
dueces literally designed this to bully us along the way as were finding it XD
doesnt reuse steps
yes, but they get insta wiped
source: me
ye very sad
i wanted a wall of kitties
but sb mean
😦
to get napkin
its required for napkin
i was normally looking around and saw ppl like arch and drakuu and believer thinking of some grand conspiracy shit (like i thought for ch with xalx and chunk)
then i saw dragoon vid
and the hunt was real
15 was
resp 1
2 was prob just a numeronym
the hunt was prob made waaaaay b4 that and the amogi are just a coincidence and i bet 5b they are unrelated
268
p me
can we stop talking abt the amogi now its becoming annoying
lets actually solve napkin
hunt discussion 268 best
can we stop mentioning it its 100% not related
why would pixel amogi be related to hunt
can we focus on changing the state of the napkin so we could see the obfuscated text instead of amogi pls
easter egg thats it lol
its literally pixel amogi and i havent heard of any theories abt it
drying it or smth like that
we have to unblur the obfuscated text
but with what
copy pasting it, sadly item desc dont work like that
ye thats why i think we have to change the state of it do a different item called "dry napkin" or smth like that
wait thats actually a really good idea
whens next jerry event
non linear
wouldnt use relics
Sirih is barb faction locked and a barb faction rep quest so most likely not related
All npcs used in thr hunt so far had no use other than the hunt
Ok
where are the bigger ones is there an img with all of em shown
darq said the nbt of napkin shows the obfuscated text as -- and -------- so we'd need a new item which would show nbt which means we prob need to change the state of the napkin to make the blurry scribbles visible
but we tried drying it in a ton of different ways and it didnt work
isnt that supposed to be the matriarch's uvula
and not actual pigs
ye i think its turning into its original state
maybe not drying
what about obtaining it b4 sailor shows up
wait i have idea
p me
can i use one of you as a kuudra fragbot for 1s i need to test smth
can i use sm1 as a kuudra fragbot rq i need to test smth
is there any way to fish at napkin place in kuudra fight or when elle is spawning it
does kuudra laser come when fight starts (elle starts fishing it up) or when tentacles spawn
u get instakilled if u get too far from kuudra arena
getting napkin before sailor shows up so it isnt wet yet
how did we know sailor dropped it
there is nothing after napkin tried fishing like 30 times after
ye we still dont know about big fish and why ice bait out of all baits
if we didnt have new dialogue it'd take us like at least 2 more weeks lol
we need to get a napkin b4 it got wet
could we get it off sailor before he dropped it into the lava
we need sailor to give it to us
was herring wikiable b4 it was found
its not wikiable cuz no1 found it yet
if it even exists that is
then our best bet is filling the obfuscated text with words from a new item or hidden npc dialogue or smth
what would 1st be
this reminds me to update believer list 💀
say
we need ideas
tell us
still tell us
isnt the game Among Us copyrighted why would they make it Among Us out of all things
it would make sense if the word among us was used in a different context in the sentence
and the amogi on the image were hinting at what the word was
how would it make sense then
the sentence "among us of yourself" doesnt make much sense
its -------- and --
what if it was initials of smth
the "of yourself" part is the 2 letter one
it'd make the most sense if it was a number
"There are at least 29 hidden Among Us characters hidden in this image." why is this on the official wiki 💀
why 15 out of all numbers
the 15 in sailor dialogue was for resp 1
i dont think it would be used again
resp 1
not 3
im dumb
pigi wiki says albuod not elbuod :pepeselfie:
it might make ppl think its not backwards double
so edit just in case when u have the time
ty for updating #read-me-first weslay 👍
wdym jungle
ye weslay should edit the img and add napkin
in the img with items in #read-me-first napkin isnt there
i think there wont be any items after napkin and that we tie in napkin with herring and solve this
what if talisman and ring exist and the step upgrades it kinda like the great spook artifact
what if the artifact step has 3 steps, 1st gives it, 2nd makes it ring, 3rd makes it artifact
**POLL:**
#deleted-channel
if theres a thing that finds amogi in images there has to be some thing that finds letters in images
did we try finding letters in cat img (not the "hang in there", hidden letters)
prob half or -2
prob half or -2
elbuod
stoopid discord lag sending my mssgs twice >:(
Whats the full sentence by filling in with "among us" and "29"
also im kinda dumb so pls tell me if among us theory is serious
glass theory was a goog theory
Couple days ago i was explaining to my friends in skull about how i spend over 4h daily on hunting a lava squid jaw in a kids block game
i was more active b4 but skull kileld me
I look it as more of it pointing fun of us like herring desc
Fishing near the Weird Sailor with any lava rod using ice bait while wearing full elegant tuxedo and a respiration 1 (must be 1, not 2 or 3) bonzo mask and having donated 1M+ to Kuudra Believer within the last 30 minutes results in fishing up the Wet Napkin
ench pufferfish and put ench glowstone or ench glowstone block for longer duration
ench pufferfish is longer duration
elbuod is backwards double
id do half or -2
@midoriya_bala_tensa ur chance for herring
Donate 4202022 coins to kuudra believer
Weve literally been trying things with it for months 💀
also its a function :J_Nerd1:
dueces made it
that should improve rates a lot
10 fishing speed
dw i tried it
doesnt work
what would it be if not a number
Give it to deng
What monkey, monkey pet?
I alr did that
I had a divan drill b4 hotm 6 :aware_animated:
if what works
the 2 letter one is prob a number
Thats too big of a hint even for 1b
How does that tie into the current step
Any ideas on the 8 letter one except among us related?
Lol same i donated over 15 times when i thought its 10 mins
I donated around 150 ‐ 200m in total idk
The last hint boar we got's hint was "someone almost brought a sea emperor to jake around 30 minutes ago" for napkin
Its in pins (dw my msg didnt ping)
I didnt
i did the "@off" thingy
Any ideas on the 2 words?
Wat abt the other one
Would all 3 "times" be the same number
it says time times time
ye but hypixel literally wont let u have more than 1. Mine got affected by blessing ench and the other one was insta wiped
did any1 try giving a napkin to their coop with a napkin
+ we most likely alrrady fully solved sailor
since we got an item from fishing next to him
those arent missing lines most likely
they were prob just indicators of the missing lines of bonzo, resp, tux and ice bait
seperating the 5 other parts of his dialogue
to show us what items
You need 2 ppl of the mage faction wearing ember armor with a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped in Scarleton Plaza, 2 ppl of the barbarian faction wearing ember armor with a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped in Dragontail Townsquare and 2 ppl wearing ember armor with a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped in Stronghold. If those conditions are met, you can claim without having ember armor or lvl 81+ kuudra pet yourself.
also rekindled ember armor also works but most ppl use normal ember armor
Theyve been out for months
unobtainable tho
they didnt get added wirh new update
thats one of the 3 dialogues
that comes when an npc cant be abiphoned
ye but the new abiphone stuff cant be related
Great 👍
Hunt is self sufficient
wouldnt use things outside mc
content released after 1 week after crimson isle was releases isnt related
take his soul
its gone for me everytime i go on my island again, then u have to put out of the frame and put in again
ye both
but the 1st one b4 napkin was found
Tried dropping all 3 variants on each of his tentacles and his head in t2
wasnt it changed so u cant recomb stuff like sulphur anymore
also what would recombing do?
the 2 obfuscated sentences r prob the same for everyone imo
dragoon wouldnt be related to the hunt as the hunt is self sufficient  meaning it doesnt require outside sources and is to be solved exclusively in Hypixel Skyblock
also the hunt was made way before dragoon made his first video on it
why would simon's island be related
it isnt related to any people, not even the hunt's creator
Also the time travel thing was already used in the step for kuudra loremaster
and hunt is non linear, meaning steps of different npcs arent related
Pomtair is faction locked and alr has a use
alr doin that
David's rods idea from #hunt-ideas and getting napkin from sailor before he dropped it
but first i wanna try over 100 variations of "even more wet" and "dry" napkins
on /wiki
wait so ur saying that under the conditions the text would change from -- and -------- to the numbers we need
yes
but however i believe herring was only used to unlock it
K i'll try
what if we need to find the obfuscated bits outside napkin
what if they are in already existing and accessible npc dialogue
hints like the ones in sailor
imo its sailor's
wait thats smart
using herring to fill in napkib
but what 2 letter word from herring would u use
its gonna be 3 months of herring soon
thats how long believer takes
i think artifact is protesters and mandible drakuu
ok thats a bit of a stretch pig
What even happened to big fish
that part was for ice bait and we caught a napkin
The 2 letter one is prob harder than 8 letter one
like what could it be
could it be an abbreviation?
It has to be an abbreviation or number if it was "HP" or "XP" it would be a different value for each player
Also different for each player
It prob leads to a donation value and it would be weird for everyone to donate a different value
any ideas for that npc?
suus is a faction locked rep quest and scholar was used in kuudra follower legs step
Are there any empty item frames in sb
wait goggles
sailor has goggles
We have to see better so it unblurs
like weslay said maybe its like with relic u can obtain one after an amount of time has passed of u getting the 1st one
Oh i havent did the thingy of bringing it to every npc yet 💀
ok imma do that when i get home
Thats suspicious vial reforge stone mafin
Nothing else
pig as stupid as this sounds try reforging napkin with it
My new theory is smth to make u see the obfuscated bits
cuz sailor wears goggles he might see the text
how do u do that
in sb
tho
What goggles/glasses are in sb except the cata ones
why would it be ci map
its literally a funny cat image
isnt the img from stock images on googles
Wear the funi armor
fish at sailor with this
do the napkin thing with this
Bozo and tux
Have 29 vials in inv while fishing at sailor
wait boots?
u didnt use full?
oh
is it still going
send ss and ask a hunter or mod to relic ping
Enhanced vision to see blurred out text ig
oh cuz tux?
kuudra loremaster is already solved
also yes there is a recreation of that skin
yea
we got napkin alr
no
what waiter tho
what npc do u mean
those are bartenders
but still worth showing em the napkin
All things added after 1 week after crimson isle release are not related
nah its from sunshade patch cuz that fixed 4k mana book giving the numbers 2 and 20 instead of 2 and 22
Wait do we have the new lines for loremaster yet
cuz meek posted that the prvs ones no work
who here didnt do loremaster chat trigger, react to this msg
Old lines r outdated we have to find the new ones
And as 2 lines were from hot tier last time, these couls be in any tier for 1 - 4 (infernal not out yet so imma rule that out)
pig do yall have the whole new kuudra dialogue yet?
cuz on wiki elle's lines are still from the old one
Ok yall who reacted ill make a party where u guys try dialogue from new kuudras (we'll do dialogue from 1 tier then move on to the next to keep it organised)
Meanwhile were waiting lets find the new loremaster chat triggers!
old ones dont work meek tested it
here
pig said for ppl with an alt but ig meek did it cuz they never did it b4
they didnt show testing that
Old lines still worked (tested by az8)
it didnt change az alr tested it
Old lines still work
looks like meek just forgot they alr told loremaster the chat trigger
lol
no it was added in the new update
not the day napkin was found
1.69%
ss?
yes
its gone
:hollow:
it expired 2 mins after he posted ss, dw tho all other times it gets relic pinged
u cant use necromancy on a plhlegblast
no not yet
he spawns in a corner
and u cant see him from far away
first ever herring unlocked sailor
us solving arch did nothing about believer
he used to be
he, average and nomface were demoted some time ago for not moderating enough if i remember correctly
not yet
As herring says, patience is the key to victory
the numbers from hints were solved, it was occurences of sailor appearing but us not noticing it
we already found and solved sailor
dont try to do that, it might autocorrect to the actual ping
its been overtried
u cant craft it, and even if u could it prob couldnt be crafted until final step
were on helmet rn
Send it to me for most things i test i get told its alr been tested
Ok just tell me if its been tested b4 i test smth k?
pretty likely, and our best bet rn
the eyes look like amoguses too
if the first obfuscated part is 29 i dont think the second obfuscated part would be among us related
29 being the first obfuscated bit makes sense, but among us/imposter/crewmate being the 2nd rlly doesnt
ye but we also gotta look for other things in the img
i think all we need is already in the image itself
:weird:
You cant use necromancy on a plhlegblast
also the bringing a sea emperor to jake is a metaphor
:pepeselfie: i exist
Kuudra 5: the kuudra mandible
we stan funny z
what would the 8 letter one be im losing my mind over this
guys hear me out
what if its believer
it kinda makes sense
i interpretate it as believer donations
not the believer
100k, 1m, 4202022
have special dialogues
Wait in this case
it would be the total donation
ok so 29 and 5302022 what would be the result of the thing
in this case im taking the 2 letter one as 29
How do i calculate it with "29" and "donation (5302022)"
the thing on napkin
So 3 possible outcomes cuz of elbuod
Calculate some rq
nop
nothing happened after napkin found
yes it has
but that would most likely never be the anwser
icy alr did
never
id rather waste that on believer
testing all numbers has 3 variations cuz of elbuod so its gonna cost a ton
tbh we dont rlly need hint all we need is prob in the napkin
no i meant that the 2 obfuscates things are prob in the img
im convinced the 2 letter one is 29
its amongi
29 of yourself ig
Either related to ur hp, mp or xp
in that case
what about total donation
all donation that give special dialogue
5302022
is total donation
pig do relic ping
man
"29" and "5302022 (total donation)"
the amongi
the 8 letter one would be 5302022
and 2 letter one 29
Tried
same
Cactus Helmet
sirih
you give him sulphur and you get barbarian reputation
he is a faction locked reputation quest
so most likely not related
any ideas on 8 letter word
like for the 2 letter one its prob easier to narrow it down
it could be hp, mp, xp, 29, another number...
for 8 letter one idk tho except believer or donation or herrings
nah we dont
this step looks way easier than sailor
theres been a large decrease of activity in hunt channels idk why
and we even have a 325m bounty
probably because we dont need one
jacob said he was quiet in the majority of august because we were so close to finding sailor
so i suppose thats the case for napkin ig ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
ye
we searched it
nothing
we solved Kuudra Loremaster already
he gave us Kuudra Follower Boots
alr tried
i want to talk abt mandible, any ideas for the obfuscated bits?
if its server wide and not player related then theres not many options
its a 2 letter word after all
I dont think it would be player related for both
what 8 letter word would be player related
i think of it as smth like first one is a number, xp, hp, mp... and 2nd one donation, believer, herrings
Ye thats what i was thinking of, 1 player related, 1 server wide
the total donation
would total donation be all of the values that give believer a different line
1k doesnt give special dialogue iirc
Under 100k, over 100k, 1m, 4202022
idk
10k?
or a combination of donating those
one after another
we donate one after another
Its the total donation
maybe doing that gives new dialogue
but ye ur right
could total herrings make sense
what if it was how many herrings the player has
player specific
I think the 2 letter one is 29
it ties in the amoguses which are weird to include
i dont think theyd add them unless they served a purpose
ok back to mandible please
kinda makes sense for it to be 29
but im stuck on the 8 letter one
where
It ties in the 29 thingies on napkin, its a number and is 2 letters
hp makes most sense in that case
cuz its the same hp for everyone in elegant tux
ye but its the same for everyone
just put in 250
we checked the nbt of the item
no
its a stock image of a cat
the cheeseburger thing from great spook isnt related to the mandible hunt
i tried those alr
which one
i did with lasea and odexar idk if i did with odger tho
u meant odger then
ye sm1 should bring kuudra teeth to him i havent did that yet
We tried clicking all kuudra npcs with kuudra teeth
no results
also clicking a plhlegblast with it
yea
lfg thread chestplate ping
#deleted-channel
and do @ chestplate ping when you want a party to get the chestplate
Not necessarily, something wouldnt be a req just because its expensive
divan drill was a req as it has the highest breaking power in the game and the cataclysmic erruption "weakens" the rock containing the kuudra relic
Coul be just for the funnies, could be related
one of the theories is that the 2nd obfuscates bit is "29" which is the amount of the amongi
since its kinda weird to just include them and them not having a purpose
Just the talis is worth it imo
netherrack about 20h with the max setup
Listed on the cool website made by carror and duggy
(Its in pins)
idk why #hunt-discussion has been dying lately we have a huge lead in the form of napkin and a 325m bounty
wdym code
nbt?
herring has an function in its nbt
not_a_hint: "f(x,y)=x^3+xy^2+y^2, u=(-125)i+(230)j"
napkin however has nothing special in its nbt
probably but it could also be a red herring
we should focus on the napkin rn
Wait he isnt? :supershocked:
prob to indicate its a hunt like golden ball was
so ppl wouldnt just brush it off as smth coming in kuuder revamp
tried both variations (tbf it was b4 we knew armor existed)
Wait stacks 💀
I forgor u were being sarcastic
Confirmed not a kuudra drop
goog forg
Kheharad?
ye
i dont think wearing npc skins would be related or that it would be locked behind a hard to obtain bingo item
but if u rlly insist on trying, voball and superduggy117 have ditto skull so they can try
ditto skull existed before crimson isles
you are confusing it with ditto blob
crimson isles released april 20th while ditto skull released on november 29th
no content released after crimson isle is related
these are just lines u get when u cant add an npc to your contacts which was added a few weeks ago
what map is that
prob a visual bug then
its backwards double
no
were still doing kuudra believer
im gonna go back to vision testing (using items related to enhancing ur vision so u could theoretically see the blurry parts)
any1 have any ideas for what items to test? list of things i tested relating to it is in #hunt-ideas idk why it wont let me link the thread
ye i tried night vision pot and sm1 alr tried lens
also i tried funi ender monocle
ye furniture
wait no its called illusion glass
also its an exclusive halloween cosmetic
so prob unrelated
wdym corrupting?
averag said its alr been tested
x y z's?
ye testing what about them
we still havent fully solved it
were currently solving Kuudra Believer's step
of which were very close to fully solving it
3/6
we need the helmet, artifact and mandible
were rlly close to helmet tho
There isnt only one set
every player can get a set
if they meet the requirememts for it
for leggings you need to click the block at -373 82 -880 with a divan's drill during a cataclysmic erruption
for boots you need to say 1 of the 3 chat triggers to kuudra loremaster then grind 5m magma cream and 5m netherrack collection and have 16 stacks of enchanted netherrack and 16 stacks of enchanted magma cream in your inventory while talking to him in the blazing fortress which you can only access from the deep caverns. Also he only appesrs in the blazing fortress on tuesdays.
for chestplate you need 2 people of the mage faction in ember armor and a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped in scarleton plaza, 2 people of the barbarian faction in ember armor and a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped in dragontail townsquare and 2 people in ember armor of any faction and a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped at the stronghold
When all those conditions are met, the claimer can talk to arch and recieve the chestplate
It has a function in its nbt
Isnt redirecting to it beanable
not_a_hint: "f(x,y)=x^3+xy^2+y^2, u=(-125)i+(230)j"
this is whats inside herring the fish's nbt
Now lemme explain the believer step so far
We cant solve it cuz the x and y r missing
also a calculator we use for it is in pins
Ok so kuudra believer so far:
the Wet Napkin also appears to have some math thing, but it has 2 obfuscated bits that we can only speculate about
out of bounds for the crimson isle
however we currently believe that Herring The Fish is a red herring as it already has a use, that being you cant catch the wet napkin without having obtained it once
You cant go to those coords on any island
if it were possible wed know months ago when the herring was found
no we found nothing there and a large portion of it is inacessible
That was only the Kuudra Loremaster step
related to time travel
yea
led to -373 82 -880
That step is fully solved
Enchanted clock is unobtainable
also only the loremaster step which is fully solved was time travel related
This sounds dumb, but there should be some 3 or 4 question quiz b4 u can talk in #hunt-discussion and #hunt-ideas that u read #read-me-first
idk how it would be implemented tho
i opened it once a month ago
and weslay said there was only 1 view 💀
in that time
how do u make like 4 questions that if u dont anwser correctly most of them you cant talk in hunt channels
But its literally unobtainable
whats even hinting at it?
time travel was loremaster and loremaster is solved
Green is tested, yellow is not fully tested, red is untestable
I think u have to enhance ur vision to see the text
cuz even if it was dried, the text would prob still be blurry
Tried
Ive tried like over 30 variations of "dry napkin" on /wiki it prob doesnt exist
Look i dont wanna sound ungrateful but what even is this hint?
what does it tell us?
At least it kinda narrows it down to it prob just being speculation abt the blanks
not actually looking for the blanks
I doubt theyd reuse the thing from arch
when u need a specific amount of players meeting a set of conditions
8
wait
thats smart
lemme think
gn
It actually does. Theres 29 amongi in the wet napkin map art.
Erruption weakens the rock that relic is stuck in
Makes sense lorewise tho
and its logical
averag why r u trying to indoctrinate ppl in #hunt-discussion too
Wouldnt be related since it wasnt released yet when hunt started
also hasnt been released yet
Light
Yea there would prob be a lot less engagement and interest in the hunt if it was linear. Making it non linear was a very good change
found in api and admin's inventory
Could be
That was one of my first theories on it
Nah just a Cinderbat
they drop Flames used in crafting Everburning Flame minion fuel
What part of his dialogue exactly?
How would it connect to the current step tho??
Obtained from Aviar and Gnyl, since it's texture is Kuudra tentacles over Sulphur and Aviar and Gnyl talk about giving Kuudra Sulphur. Prob some Sulphur related step that maybe involves the Kuudra Fight
What u testing?
Its confirmed it exists
Seen in API and an admin's inventory
Oh smart!
give to Velyna too
Whats the reasoning behind that donation value
Velyna
same, but i still find the hunt kinda interesting
the problem rn is most ppl interpret this step as bruteforcing donations
which probably it is
we should just be happy we have one, even tho its not much
27
I hope they make one after we solve the hunt lol
and that u can see how much you donated yourself
Jacob was hinting at herring first and you CANT obtain napkin unless u have obtained herring the fish at least once
yes
but you cant obtain napkin unless you have obtained herring the fish at least once
also weird sailor was the thing herring unlocked
Yes talon tested it on his alt without herring
however i still believe 4202022 is the commencement
and that the 8 letter blank is unrelated tk 4202022
no
theyre called cinderbats
so it cant be that
What would hint at that tho
Yea
that makes the most sense
Could how long pleb survives without water breathing also be related? :thonking:
With a rod without frail
I wanna test on plhlegblast too tho
No it must be 2 pieces pogo #1 pig #2 2 pieces pig #1 pogo #2
frick
im not home
i wont be able to log on today at all
What he says is the formula for magical power
so hes probably unrelated
350k smth for me
Divan Drill is only a single step
if right conditions are met, all you need for chestplate is talking to arch no matter what
Yea in one of the posts from last year they said nether revamp will be late/end game or something
it totally makes sense
Also the new kuudra tiers wont be able to just be beaten by players with combat 24
Also the divan drill req makes sense lorewise
Divan drill has highest breaking power so it breaks the strong volcano rock kuudra relic is stuck in while the rock is also weakened by the strongest volcano erruption
no
Only divan drill and only divan drill
oh so thats how averag knew i visited him that one time
Ice bait melts in lava so napkin becomes wet
only explanation
yo gg
What would hint at pristine tho
we currently believe it revolves around believer as all steps before did
yea
its a metaphore
its 29 amonguses
the 2nd blank is probably 29
yes
nice
gm pig
i have 1b of my gdrag bank
willing to waste it all
:yep:
all of us
i love the 😄
it look funi idk why
anyways back to le funi :follower:
ikr
i love big pepeselfie
ok now lets actually talk about the donation values
total "herrings"
-391 81 -702 believer coords
8 digits.
yes remove the -
thats serious dedication
u deserve #1
i donated smth around 190m
so far
gn
whats next? || h*m radio?||
make it so mods, hunters, VETERANS :2Sunglasses:, seasoned get it first
no
bad idea
also as seen from weslay's prvs msg hunter channel isnt some big gatekeeping conspiracy lmfao
its just another hunt discussion
tbh it would just result in mafin @hunterperson "random words here" in #hunt-discussion or smth lol
from viewing it
its most likely 29
its a metaphor
for when were very close to the solution
i said i will donate when i can log on then chaos said the value wouldnt make sense
but that doesnt matter anymore
we have the herring
lol pig got jacobruby moment'd
jacob, did anyone try to bring a sea emperor to jake today?
knew it
hintin time
"big fish" (space included)
only part of sailor that wasnt used
big fish try big fish
bai (⌐■_■)/
ok were close
like rlly close
feels like the time we were doin arch
were techincally  closer than before since we know its not 4202022
thats my interpretation
were still closer than b4
thats the point
but the number has alr been used up
the meaning of it
same question
what
so for 8 letter one r we looking for a number or word cuz i dont have many ideas for numbers rn
hm
wouldve jacob also said it if the herring wasnt publicly discovered but by only 1 person
what would that step be tho?
it all points to the equation's result being a donation value
why do you keep posting this image
7292022 for commencement ig
Herring was found
yea
but what number would be in napkin
except 29
ice bait melt in lava make water so napkin is wet from that ig
we thought he was related to dark auction
at first
by this logic wetness and water should be related
wet napkin was caught in lava
so id relate it to lava more
wdym disguised as a fish
big fish from sailor dialogue?
i still think that isnt napkin
nor kuudra
ye
but we thought we were fishing for kuudra
cuz big fish was vague
we didnt know what we were fishing for
kuudra? a fish? something entirely else?
sailor wrote the scribbling on napkin right?
i still think like with herring being given to us by kuudra the whole believer step is a test by kuudra to us if we are worthy of it
and sailor is literally just a form kuudra took after the fight
ye most likely
and a long time ago too
i dont think we should look into why obfuscated bits are obfuscated
u dont need to donate 1m to get a pleb
u just fish one up then donate 4202022 and receive herring
but u have to bring the plhlegblast to the believer
wait are you testing something
or trynna get herring
full squid gear wont do anything
just squid hat makes chances higher
Mandiblecraft
Jacob confirmed that number wont be used anymore
Yes
But it should be kept as "released in the future" so people dont connect it to the hunt as it was released 6 months after hunt started
u have to manually mine it all by yourself
takes around 20h with the maxed setup for it which is listed on the awesome website made by carrot and duggy
Kuudra Archeologist is already solved also you csnt get any souls from mobs in kuudra fight
We believed it was the 4202022, although that was disproven by jacobruby
we currently believe the commencement is 7292022
aka the date we discovered herring the fish
sea emperor to jake is a metaphor
for when were close to the solution
This isnt tho, this hunt has multiple long and complicated steps
Yes
but sea emperor to jake wouldnt be use in this hunt, its simply a metaphor
imo 7292022 as commencement isnt rlly complicated
date herring was found makes sense
We need a simple solution to the 8 digit one tho
Also relates to the current step, we alr solved 3 npcs and those wont be used again
Tides hint still makes no sense imo
and jacob did say he wanted to make a "useless" hint
We alr knew those
b4 the solution
i performed most tests with those
we were focusing on "big fish" too much
it was just a hint we have to fish, not use a fish like herring or fish up kuudra
we know that the obfuscated bits are numbers 100%
kuudra believer info list updated with the newest info
Oh i made so much money from doing that...
Test what?
lol seeing sm1 get the blessing b4 claiming napkin in the wild
very funi
4202022
that number has alr been used tho
JacobRuby confirmed it wont be used again
Uhhh
nothing rlly
its double backwards
yes you havent seen the pre-herring suffering
👍
that new rule isnt even in #roles yet
whats the time for u rn
were still on kuudra believer
were 3/6 of the stuff needed
so far we got kuudra follower leggings, kuudra follower boots, kuudra follower chestplate then for the believer step herring the fish and wet napkin
believer step leads to kuudra follower helmet
then there are 2 more steps one for kuudra follower artifact and one for the kuudra mandible
we dont have kuudra tali yet
kuudra relic is a quest item
not an accessory
the relic is only used to get kuudra follower leggings
nothing else
and mandible
were 3/6
nah
artifact is prob the protesters
i mean the texture is *LITERALLY* tentacles over sulphur
he comes back on tuesday
so in 3d
you can hunt without hunting in game
o7
its hard to really hunt in this step
because pig is the one who should donate all values
all hunting i can rlly do is suggesting ideas/values rn with believer
pig while ur updating that in #roles, please for the love of god fix the "To earn this role, you just need to spend some time chatting in hunt-discussion or off-topic" for rookie role
also ik only chaos can update it cuz they made the og post but still
hunting will be much easier at the artifact step
yea just putting together values for pig to test
thats the most we can do rn
m a n
(rel)
herring alr has a use
it unlocked sailor
No
Were close tho
yes, also the solution wouldnt be just as simple as that
7282022 could work but we can never know if sm1 got herring b4
so yea 6112019 is our best bet rn
Yea
Jacob is a credible source tho
hm
yea thats an interesting theory that should be looked into. 1M makes a lot of sense as commencement.
Its basically the start of sailor step
Also i dont think blazing fortress related things would be reused, as we alr had that in the loremaster step
Problem with flaming sword is that its unobtainable
rather try testing with blade of the volcano
its obtainable and eerily similar to the sword with emblems that velyna mentions
Yea it became unobtainable with crimson isle update
Vanquished magma necklace iirc
In the collection
Rekindled isnt in magma cream collection lol
rekindled ember is made from rekindled ember frags
dropped by the new magma boss
old ember armor works with arch, but so does rekindled
but yea old ember is unobtainable
rod was unobtainable since pets v2
in may 2020 lol
Anyways i think we should look into az's idea
of 1000000 being the commencement
in discussion
yea prob that
elbuod comes at the end
Its in #hunt-announcements
just scroll up a bit
74999999 could also work but the result would prob be a huge number
i dont rlly think the number needed for helmet would be more than 100m
yea
below 50m makes the most sense
Could be higher tho, tux was 75m after all
The 1m idea was rlly good
We should look into that
It makes sense as commencement
cuz its the start of the sailor step
we all pretty much agree the 2 digit one is 29, right?
we need a good reliable 8 digit number
29 makes sense, we need a 8 digit number that would also make sense
4202022 was confirmed to not be used
1000000 (credit to az)
10132022 is 8 digit too so hmmm
maybe for 8 digit one 10132022
and 1m for commencement
29 for 2 digit
napkin
Yea that was my first idea for commencement
but we can never be sure if sm1 found it b4 us
Ig we can trust it then
what would be the 8 digit one tho
7282022 would make more sense for commencement tho
gn
gg, ur alr halfway there!
Prob dojo
ss the coords then go to them at a higher y lvl
Yea it 100% isnt cuz it was released after crimson
gg
like 20h
Yea were closer than ever
we have confirmation 4202022 is not used and confirmation the blanks are 100% numbers
1000000?
Yea
I currently believe its our best bet for commencement
Either 1000000 or 6112019 imo
Most likely 29, nothing has been confirmed tho
Related to the wet napkin item and kuudra believer npc
We know the blanks in wet napkin are numbers
the commencement isnt 4202022 and the number 4202022 wont be used again
We currently have the ideas of 1000000 and 6112019 for the commencement
While most of us agree the 2 digit blank is 29, which is the number of among us characters on the wet napkin map art (im not joking)
We believe after donating the right value we will get the helmet in the same fashion we got herring the fish
Send ss
Dm me
Ok they dm'd me
I will relic ping
do /p uwuimacatgirlowo for lobby
Sorry not on rn
It says that b4 the herring equation
We currently believe herring the fish is a red herring
Imma log on 3 mins
dw epoa im alr doin it
Ur prob gonna be able to get it
Did u click bookshelf?
Yea
Messisteve r u alr in the lobby
Same!
gg!
Alr closed pc
btw do u have collat
That isnt 1.16b...
GG!
GG!
so ig u dont scam
hmu if u want another relic during cata
ty
shouldnt take that long, took me 1 night from hotm6 - hotm7
should take a couple days max if u have a good setup, good lobbies and a dillo
tbh u just need good routes to locations where a lot of mobs spawn and routes that connect the 4 zones to each other. having royal pigeon helps immensely
520202200000
🤓
man i did it manually 💀
imma try calling her in spider specific locations rq
called aranya on top of spider's den, in arachne cave, arachne spawn place, arachne spawn place while a t1 is active, arachne spawn place while a t2 is active
tonberry's idea
tried at all major locations
except the solved npc's
1s
done
yea
:aware_animated:
as soon as u log on im making a chestplate party
spooky festival
bat person armor
and holding smth like a midas staff
yea
yea were closer than ever to solving kuudra believer
we have confirmation 4202022 wont be used and the napkin's blanks are numbers
its been confirmed they are
jacob, the admin that supervises the mandible hunt
no, not that
he said the sea emperor thing in weslay's idea thread
about the blanks being numbers
yea that was it
me too!
i focused more on "Big Fish" and just always used a bonzo mask with resp 1
i changed to Guild > [MVP+] FlochForster [HUNTER]: if its not pogo or pig to get #1 mandible ill void my #8 chestplate (real)
hi
good

sen ss

@ℜöƃø send me a screenshot
of the cataclysmic
how much colalt u got rn
1.16b

yoooo gg huge W
*
i hope pig gets a sponsor on the mandible video he rlly worked hard this entire hunt
golden ball texture
its 100 xp
u get 10 - 20 xp each 2 minutes u send a msg
yea chaos pls fix that
its been so long
i am a "No ping reply" enjoyer
yooo huge W pig
2nd one lol
yea it was added with the kuudra revamp update
unrelated to the hunt
no
no hunt related npcs have a number sadly
oh wait that reminds me i havent done my daily 500k yet
its exploding come fast
/p FlochForster
bru
it literally just ended
bing bong cataclysmic gone
Nice
Im also getting to 2m today
Yea
Btw u have 5m netherrack, whats ur edition?
Nice
im getting smth around #130 next week
What is the lead
Poll
Also bottle of jyrre
Could help reach the final 50 or 100 intel
np
Basically it gets pinged when someone gets a lobby with a cataclysmic volcano explosion
and then you can click at -373 82 -880 with a divan's drill to obtain the kuudra relic which you have to bring to the kuudra archeologist to get Kuudra Follower Leggings
But first you have to click a book with 4k intel (4.1k mana) but u can do that anytime
I tried that a few days ago xD
image and description
No
I didnt
yoooo nice
You cant milk squids anymore
That was in like alpha minecraft or smth
I dont think the solution would require plugins tho
so true carrot
it looks like napkin imposter on pc!
one of the 2 kuudra protesters
outside of the forgotten skull
But all hunt npcs so far havent had any use
While aranya alr has a use
Idk, ppl in cowshed have been getting it too, it happens when you get kicked from t4 kuudra
Yea sm1 in cowshed said it also happened in ch
im at 2m/5m rn
gotta do 4h of netherrack each day :aware:
nice
im planning on getting to 3m today, 4m tmr and 5m monday
yo nice
im also getting to 3m today
he confirmed that it isnt
#hunt-announcements
also pins in #hunt-discussion
yea thats our best theory rn
and makes sense since it begins the sailor step
Downtiming rn
When i get home imma sweat for 3h
we never said anything abt server pfps :trol:
:huuh:
:catYes:
yes please that jacob
stuff released after crimson isle isnt related
@Messisteve 😼
kid named #hunt-announcements:
We are close
We have confirmation that 4202022 isnt commencement and isnt used
It prob wouldnt reuse stuff from previous steps tho
Nice
I hit 4m netherrack today
its been that for pig since like july xD
no
huge W
gg messisteve!
I got a ugly number :Frog_Cry: :Frog_Cry2:
man i wanted #128
got fricked up with #127
then 130 is prob alr taken
i claimed it the second loremaster appeared
Its currently believed its a red herring
As it already has a use, the first one ever unlocked the weird sailor
omg
u cant abiphone her
also ive talked to all npcs in crimson holding funny fish and funny napkin while donating 1m b4
so its not that
jacob only gives hints, he is not part of the hunt
its currently believed that the 2 digit obfuscated bit is 29, as there is 29 amoguses on the image
ah you summoned him
I am noticing a distinct lack of kuudra follower helmet
kuudr mandbl
Dont fish him in the pit
Fish him in the lava on the surface
The one closest to believer
Also dont forget leads and water breathing pots
stuffy
Herring cost wont be used
nice
27
cool
Nice ur prob hitting it tmr
its a number, not a word
no the 8 digit blank is a number
GG!
:sotrue:
W
no way
duggy found the helmet
stuffy
binger
i get home soon™️
W
pinger me for drill when cata
you need to donate 1m to kuudra believer before the kuudra run
that lifts the barriers and makes the sailor visible
he has a combat 31 profile
but he doesnt want to use it
29d???
Is that a napkin reference
W
relic ping?
who has it
/p technology2 for plhlegblast
(allows you to get herring the fish)
i will donate 4 coins for edition 2
take it or leave it
pretty much
29
I used to say that before ohd existed
infernal was released like 1 week ago lol
man weslay beat me to it
Did u get one reshi
:sotrue:
this made me cry 😢
that sentence, "Kuudra Mandible.", it sent chills down my spine
wait was he actually?
insane
hinter
burning kuuder armor?
burning eyes?
cinderbat?
believer lava?
velyna mentions something similar to a blade of the volcano
cook the herring!!!! :yep: (real)
wait if its "vaguely" would it even involve fire
or just the idea of heat
insane
jungle pomtair is a barb faction locked rep quest npc
also things have been mass tested with him and potatoes
please lets not revisit deng x pam :pain:
throw on porc
u cant reforge it :kekw:
im looking into values relating to said hint npcs
no pig
please no
btw match sticks are quite literally "burning", not just vaguely burning so i dont think thats it
too far of a stretch
pig, please calm down
which kind of
i also dont think erruptions would be reused, even if it was just any eruption
what do u guys think tho
velyna values :yep:
if the npc is velyna, its most likely blade of the volcano
no, its speculation that its an npc
that the hint was referring to an npc
thats why im looking into values relating to npcs of interest
no
no dates are used
a number i found is 5000, npc sell price of blade of the volcano
no idea where to incorporate it tho
its digits
not word
nop, no official statement on coords
jacob confirmed it
duggy or carrot's about me for the official hunt website
maybe stats of blade of the volcano?
or the npc sell price
guys when hunting for the vaguely burning thing, keep in mind were looking for a value/digit
im giving up on porc :sadge:
velyna, still has potential
barb npc who talks about listening to fire
barb colosseum
theres a colosseum in dragontail
.
hmmm maybe how much essence u get from salvaging blade of the volcano
yes it has exclusive dialogue if you have beaten kuudra at least once
yes
do you see the pattern
velyna was being looked into before the hint
thanks for ur dedication to the hunt, spending like 60m for a test
hm
obsidian skin
hmmmm
Porc
anyone
some have faction locked dialogue tho
but npcs with faction locked dialogue shouldnt be looked into
i rember :pain:
i wanted to do it, but wasnt fishing 27 yet lol
also epoa killed one with alch staff
:sotrue:
@StoredGiraffe31 (⌐■_■)/ bring everburning flame to velyna too
yes
oh yea
also first week book displayed 2 and 20, thus making the hunt impossible
jacob confirmed it
Yes, no dates
another problem is, that it wouldnt be something that includes "burning" in the name
since its "vaguely burning"
imagine herring was a herring and amogi meant nothing
:sadge:
fandom wiki said greg has 20 base mf, while it has 10 base mf
i hate fandom wiki from then on so much
(it made me buy greg)
wait i just realized i had that too 💀
i turned it on like months ago in a survival world for a singular screenshot 💀
man i got used to minimal brightness, imma play on it forever now
ok guys
lets discuss the hints now
also i hope jacob gives hints towards hints :prayge:
why 10m for 8 digit?
elaborate
we have chaos butterfly
what about weslay onion
mmm monke
so true
making believer take like half a year so far :aware:
So true, Matteoka
:catyes: YES
i love random stickers sending when i click on emoji
:aware:
If we knew the item was "Wet Napkin" itd make sense
but ice bait for a big fish???? no no no
:sotrue:
these 3 are solved, they were hint npcs for loremaster
prob referring to overhearing their conversation, but idk if it rlly had a deeper meaning
:catyes:
landon is another hypixel admin
was a plhlegblast nearby
bruh
you have to do it
when a plhlegblast is nearby
ok
around 130
same
their ign is amcneil and theird discord is allan1#4203
Its prob hard to get one urself, just go to #roles for cataclysmic lobby ping role and youll be pinged when one happens
just wait for sm1 to get one
sometimes it takes days
if u wanna look for it urself tho, just lobby hop and check tab if  volcano explosivity says "CATACLYSMIC" in dark red
same
:kuudra_mandible:
Stuffy
yes, a hunter/mod pings the role when someone gets a cataclysmic lobby
whats the idea
is stuffy's skin a reference to him being a hunter? (real)
you kinda literally just said "whats the 8 digit number? you think of it." :pepeselfie:
bro u literally just said "t2 kuudra is related to burning. whats the 8 digit value? you think of it."
how can u check how much dmg exactly u dealt to kuudra tho
theres nothing that shows that
Unobtainable
they wont use an unobtainable item
Tried
I'll forever miss mafinam pinging me about drill here
😢
wait
does this mean one of the times is the current skyblock season
hm
i still think its related to one of the times tho
With how the hint is saying, what if one time is sb month, another sb day, another sb year
like its all pointing to that rn
That would be called a "humorous hilarious comedical funny moment"
i once had a dream dwagon and some rando found it and were demanding some op new item from a new update to leak method XD
and #2 legs and #2 boots
yea pogo has #1 legs and #1 boots
🤨
(napkin reference)
@midoriya_bala_tensa
:sotrue:
No, why would you need those?
L
:follower:
Kuudra Mandible
guys the number is ||yalostdagame||
leaker smh
imma leak the number rq

[SkyBlock] [VIP+] Staysimple1 is visiting Your Island!

:sotrue:
:hmmm:
ok
log on
:pepeselfie:
why were none of you so active when helmet wasnt found yet and we were all hunting for it? 🤨
:sotrue:
:sotrue:
no please not this again
NO WAY
wait fr?
i didnt know!
hello, Aviex45
🔼
:follower:
ok so, you have to sulphur evolve the plhlegblast and helmet magically appears in your inventory
NO way
lol
jacob got napkin imposter edition
yooooo bot's out
cool gamer momen
what are editions at rn?
weird sailor is in a boat...
is that a weird sailor reference
wasnt it just reshirex and artificial
or did i forgor
bot out
im actually surprised how weslay managed to do a bot which works very well in just a few hours
@Weslay good job well done man!
link ur discord account in main lobby
INSANE
no way
*unmods chaos*
we do not support the fandom wiki here.
its prob highly innaccurate like literally everything there
it literally lies abt all minion costs
and has many stats listed wrong
he says "you look like someone worth talking to, but now is not the time"
same!
@Goat Girl Gwen
Get chestplate
its rlly easy to get
literally takes like 10h
from hotm6 - hotm7
Base drill???
a clean one?
I should prob sell my divanner once i reach 10 relics
and get a x655
its 700m profit
I did the first one
:yep:
There is
Drakuu says "I could talk to you, but the conditions arent right"
idk if thats exactly it tho :/
Goofy ahh messisteve
I did first ping (they were like 0.3s apart)
How would that do anything
Newest advent hint literally says drakuu...
Theres a hint each day
get a ping role in #roles
the hints are posted in #hunt-announcements
Reaction role in #roles
On a bridge connecting 2 small towers, right of the forgotten skull
Insane
"You look like someone worth talking to, but now is not the time" - when wearing 4/4 follower
Base mage skin
:sotrue:
sadly, true
"burning" hint was for the already solved kuudra believer
Tried
Metherrack
Its been HEAVILY implied herring made sailor appear
My personal theory is that sailor is a form kuudra takes after the fight, to give us clues towards obtaining the napkin
Do u rember deng x pam 💀💀💀💀💀💀
No
:sotrue:
ok calm down guys
lets talk about drakuu
so true
what is happening here :aware:
#general?
yes
What makes you think that
GIANT_THE_FISH
:tr:
leaker 😠
the "c" in cTalon stands for "cLeaker"
the "m" in PogoDuck stands for "Mandible Owner"
:tr:
mmm mandible
Only fish
also a plhlegblast must be nearby
btw, u dont need a fish to obtain the helmet
you need a napkin tho
You dont need fish to get the helmet
you just need the wet napkin
ok
u can get both on same plhleg btw
you need fishing 27 to catch a plhlegblast
if you dont wanna fish, pick up the plhlegblast ping role in #roles
and youll get pinged when someone catches one
#deleted-channel
pig how do you feel about believer not involving your beloved sulphur evolution?
:pepeselfie:
Worst mistake ive ever made
#deleted-channel
legendary kuudra pet became obtainable with the kuudra revamp
hunt was solvable since crimson release
:J_Nerd1:
wasnt aaron hunter back in dragoon's
kuudra follower artifact
while wearing squid hat
otherwise, 1/1000 to replace a lava sea creature
:hollow:
nice
listen to music
yea
maybe listen to smth
@SuperDuggy117 !!!
Seasoned rank
10k xp
you get 10 - 20 xp each 2 mins when talking in #hunt-discussion or #hunt-ideas-follower
but xp farming will be penalized by mods
No
Do /rank with tatsu
10k xp is seasoned role
Im at like 58k
Mandible
He was mostly saying off topic stuff in #hunt-discussion tho xD
*- mafinam
anyways were getting kinda off topic here, lets discuss the newest jacob hint
what do you guys interpret it as
Arch.
i think it arch
Most based hunt npc
aaand hunt is now undoable for a week
reshi did u change ign again
im broke asfrick so ill do a kuudra mandible orb collection
35k
So true, Aviex45
average.exedible
duggy its been 4 months...
*artifact and mandible
relic is a quest item used in archeologist lol
:doesheknow:
in one test, me, pogo, mafinam and i forgor the 4th person were literally looking everywhere around kuudra's end, but only before the fight since i thought it wouldnt involve us killing kuudra xD
Jacob isnt part of the hunt
do i plhlegblast ping
/boop Dominik313
mmm mandible
thats a bigger stretch than napkin equation stuff tho :/
insane
set up a party in #deleted-channel
leads and a water breathing potion 6
how do you get money from bingo?
theres literally a ping role for it
no need for anyone to spam ping you
released after crimson isle
unrelated.
yes
time travel was kuudra loremaster step
who then
do u mean aura?
and yes
chester!
whats the reasoning behind testing that?
:aware:
the kuudra mandible hut is where the kuudra mandible lives
you cannot use necromancy on a plhlegblast
hunt discussion
*gets beamed*
what da jacob typin
agreed
insane landon is here
stop posting about baller ❗
is that a "spirits are high" hint reference???
so cowshed?
based
it is
accept it.
GG!
helmet next
things like loremaster could be solved without hints
archeologist, arch too
believer? years and years and years
:J_Agony:
hunt discussion moment
Arch coudlve been solved without hints too
would duggy's idea getting sea emped be considered a hint?
otherwise, no
itd take a while, but napkin would eventually get found
solved tho? i think everyone wouldve given up b4 napkin was solved
Maybe not just saying the number
Like you have for example Yoink
he says he likes watching netherwart grow
maybe just make the npc say "i like counting netherrack in my spare time"
Blessing is alr obvious from believer himself
That wouldnt rlly be needed
The original dragoon' video was changed to ohd invite the day ohd was made public
29 Kuudra Mandibillion times
Kiweh do u have a list of all ppl with full follower?
make a list and put in pins
would be very useful
You dont need it during the kuudra fight
just when fishing at sailor
also u need full tux
@BrickFish tell them the other 12 so they can update it
go go go carrot
quintuple!
same fr ong
thanks, carrot
yooo nice
setup a party in lfg thread
and carrot should join so u both get it
yea, if u dont have help them out
bro at least get chestplate and helemt
those are insanely easy to get
4/4 if u have sm1 lend u the divan's
idk why the set is such a problem for some people, ive seen people speedrun full set in here
even jungle whos poor speedran it
ironman is a different story...
its literally impossible on ironman
does anyone even have it on ironman
legs
who
getting pieces is literally the most fun thing ever for me
netherrack is pain, but neccessary pain
in some regard, since i knew id get boots
i want that SO bad
put in bank and withdraw
once the plhleg spawns
:doesheknow:
just wait for a plhlegblast ping
:doesheknow:
we need a does he know emoji fr ong
lumino fiber pro tip - buy a fire veil wand and salvage it
if u dont wanna ashfang
i got a maxed mining setup as an excuse to get a divan's drill so i can collect relics :kekw:
kuudra relics
yes we both need a big kuudra relic collection
theres a 7d cooldown
between getting them
you said ur nw is 700m :pepeselfie:
TRUE
imagine not having 4/4 kuudra follower (real)
jungle and carrot
in my personal opinion, spoon should get a huge buff and hyp should be deleted from the game
:sotrue:
i like spoon because i like the visual gold blocks
but were kinda getting off topic here, so uhh mandible mandible
lets discuss spoon vs sceptre in #general please
lets keep this channel related to the hunt
ok so guys how are you interpretating the newest jacob hint?
as everyone in a crimson lobby?
:J_Agony:
yea prob
he also says the clearest hints will be near christmas
so at least that
👍
imagine jacob forgets abt the final hint of christmas because he'll be too busy with bloons
"necromancy isnt related" and "the solution requires cooperation of all the server" seems pretty clear
:sotrue:
jacob too
he stepped down because of school
kuudra black magic
:sotrue:
yea he obtained it when he finished making the hunt in 1970
Mandible
:sulphur: + :psquidspin: = :pig:
weslay has #3 boots and helmet
9 months
also 0.5 magic find and 16 magical power
kuudra follower artifact
yes
like every sane human being
rift is its own thing
unrelated to the hunt
kuudra mandible
excuse me what :J_Agony:
screenshot and ill ping
plhlegblast ping
hes not fishing 27
therefore he cannot fish one up
simple as that
herring react this man
its a carrot
@Carrot is that you
based
yes
move it to believer with a lead
wtfrick how
i have #49 herring
because hotel wifi
you literally got a single digit edition
why even ask yourself yes or no
thats like me deciding if i should donate 13m or no for helemt
its kinda funny
how believer got solved b4 carrot got fishing 27
wait theres only 2 fishing line spots?
couldve sworn it was 3
All I want for Christmas is the Kuudra Mandible
ok make a party in lfg thread now
for chestplate
you dont need anything
you dont need ember
you can claim without anything
u just need 6 other ppl
3 barbs 3 mages
did u get a person
do they have ember and lvl 81+ kuudra pet
just ask chaos lol
chaos wont hate you just because bucklez has you blocked xD
😮
Merry Mandiblemas!
no leaking
oh ok
its called #deleted-channel
thats it
the crafting for 28 slots takes less than an hour
:mandible:
agreed
ask @Messisteve  he did this cool place of magma minis on his island
i literally just put up 15 and they were done in 35d
hyper catalysts
#deleted-channel
Around 20h with the optimal setup
jacob typing in announcements o:
typing again
lol
say mandible rn
dueces was ending the hunt with mandible being a lie your idea
dueces when did you start making the hunt
was it your idea to make the mandible a lie
WHY IS COWSHED INVADING AAAAA
half a week for 9 months lol
ty for making the hunt tho man, been rlly fun
not 12h like spook and also not 9 months like kuudra follower
next one should be 1 - 3 monts
nice
another question, how did u think ppl would solve ur version of arch and believer?
those 2 were basically impossible
dueces what was the thought process behind your old believer and arch steps
did you think ppl could even solve them
dueces what was in your head when you made "total" the total netherrack on crimson isles
O_O
can you anwser pls
thats a different question
cowshed why are you here
@Carrot hunt over 🤯
he has #0 helm
i think you need fledling to react
yes
kuudra mandible should be kept in bazaar so ppl can use it as a coins storage
:catyes:
archive this when
scct scct scct
why is cowshed invading
scetha use the boar
just a jacob ping for no reason
yeah weslay should remove hint boar
pin
the mandible doesnt exist
you need full set for the artfact
:sulphur: + :psquidspin: = :pig:
i have everything just need the lobby
in over an hour and a half of lobby swapping found none
no way insane
its 5 am for me :yep:
we love sleep deprivation for a lava kraken jawline in a block game that turned out to not even exist
yes
it was lies and deception
me watching #hunt-discussion go through the 5 stages of grief: :aworryPopcorn:
look its 6 am ok
timezones gaming
:nomandible:
bro this literally says its over
yall are in stage 1: denial fr ong
it just says the hunt was follower and not mandible hunt lol
you will not be making that structure sadly
:nomandible:
Nah netherrack minion not needed
the fact its a grind that you cant buy yourself out of is what makes loremaster my favourite npc
And its bruteforcing...
believer was badly designed
And mandible the thing you buy
theres another huge problem
lets say you get the whole lobby to jump
what about ppl with /togglechat and afk ppl???
Damn fishing 50 on ironman
nice
One guy being particulary annoying
even after the eruption ended
Imma just hope everyone in the next cata lobby i find will jump when i tell them to
:copium:
still need to do my 100h mining plan
man
its powder grinding + ruby
average is the one with a 100h netherrack mining plan (real)
Yea i hope this gets changed
its basically impossible rn
I hope landon changes it to 10 ppl jumping like lox suggested :prayge:
yea that too
btw lox do u have a 655 on ur ironman
nice
and jumping being randomness
lower collection reqs to what
i think 3m or 4m would be fine
Nah too low
Drakuu is just so... random
hes supposed to be the final npc and his solution is jumping during a cata eruption?
All i want is to get artifact before the end of the year
:prayge:
u need it
Speaking of...
jungle check #general
It was leading to the Kuudra Follower Artifact
I mean we did get the Kuudra Follower Artifact
B A S E D
i have plenty evidence already tho
so does jungle
Nothing
getting on soon
who do i boop/party join
you dont need herring for helmet, unless u want it as a collectible
kuudra follower artifact
ayo
Do u have a squid or just a fishing party
i hope there were, just so more ppl would be actively lobby hopping
:yep:
idc abt edition i just want it b4 the end of the year
wait rlly?
man
but u can museum all other kuudra follower stuff
bruh momento
you can even museum the herring
bruuuuh
next time we can do it guys
:yep:
it means they still listened
WE CAN DO THIS GUYS
we can do this
gogogo
imma go lobby swap
no.

chaos_f11er

man :sadge:
EvilSnowman1337 flashbacks
we managed to do it tho!
bruh
jacob is no longer admin
great now its a ghost ping
please dont ping staff or ex-staff.
@Sir_Cow kuudra mandible
Yes
In a few months/years make them suffer for their past sins.
Still nice of you to help fill lobbies to help others get it 👍
and dw, you will eventually get alloy or reqs will change to x655
:thispicgoeshard:
only
I had to do 1.6m in one day and only got 220k/h, u can do this stuffy!
Thats bad actually
some people get like 270k/h
I kinda had to do rogue sword
i think thats why i got 220k/h
Why
Why do you need 500 health on krampus
so true
b
:aware:
1.5m u got this stuffy
Like 6 more hours
Worst part about the step is griefers
TOXIC GRIEFERS
No you need netherrack
😨
redemption arc
gg
No way lol
thats 20h
Marcinimini, from oblivion's msg
Hes in this server lol
Says this is his ign like 3 times
Wait how is that possible
Bruh
now its gonna be impossible to detect scammers/ratters/griefers
Best channel fr
talon is cowshed chester
no
NO
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
*mafinam and uwudwagonl flashbacks*
yelling at me to give it to ppl who didnt even have collat
:nomandible:
Jacob doesnt handle that stuff + hes no longer an admin
i think mrkeith does the account security things i could be wrong tho
no you arent
What was the concept
tbh if Jacob did an at everyone for herring, he shouldve done it for artifact discovery too
it was literally the end of the hunt
Only like 15 ppl got it :aware:
Hope next lobby works :prayge:
You will take my drill for legs.
man
*cough* voball *cough*
its so funny how he was right
loomroaster
@Carrot go get helmet nerd
no way
gg
get boots and legs now
ill give u gear for netherrack
@FuriouslyFast42 give carrot my netherrack stuff when ur done
carrot needs it more than nelson
Wait he does legs first
Bearded has some
ask him
chaos also has them
Carrot ask chaos if he can lend you his minions
He was there in may
Jungle there are literally early game money making methods that make 1m/h like killing treasure hoarders
dont complain
chaos and stuffy funny moments compilation
Im getting cata 50 once i get accessories
chaos you should lend carrot magma minid
:catyes:
budget catnod
Im doing that once i get 64 more teeth
it looks so goddamn cool
It looks like kuudra's tentacles over sulphur or im just insane
It looks like that, but it looks like tentacles on top
The entirety of mount vesuvius smelled like sulphur
then a cataclysmic eruption happened
Weslay sulphur evo IS used in the hunt :yep: :yep: :yep:
its the texture of the artifact
:follower_artifact:
its kooder tentacles over sulphur
:yep:
squid named finger (im sorry)
cata lobby?
jacob why
messi why
Same!
as much as i am for Carrot getting hunter, i kinda agree with duggy here
why would he need hunter if theres no active hunt :/
He used to be hunter
WAIT
with veteran is either you get hunter or you get banned (mafinam said that)
and carrot isnt hunter rn...
carrot pls dont get banned
Depends
like how many warns, mutes and timeouts do you have
Can confirm that happens (i was the coin)
yea
:aware:
lo
l
Factions were irrelevant to arch all this time...
What made chestplate parties always take so much time was the factions part
Wait so its an infant state
so it needs to be evolved
:sulphur: + :psquidspin: = :pig:
There is no rng in the hunt 🤓
@ lox
Why did solved things change for the 27373939362627th time
There is a random "-" after Stuffy's line
Like after the whole part
And after bearded's part too
a random "-"
So true
I remember when i cata pinged and messi pinged like 0.4s after i did xD
Guys do u wanna know a fun fact
In SuperDuggy117's name, the 2 g's are pronounced like j's
i have a slight suspicion landon buffed rates by a ton...
I was gone for a day or two and saw like 9 cata pings in here
It obviously means we need to bring an Atoned Horror to Jake to receive the Kuudra Mandible smh
@Xiadie
EvilSnowman1337, QatarWorldCup, Marcinimini
although EvilSnowman1337 at least listened at the end
and we got the arti
:sotrue:
@fanibus doggc
you make me power
Average #hunt-discussion moment
Make him say "My name is SuperDujjy117"
nft
There is no mandible
:nomandible:
The Kuudra Mandible is an EPIC Reforge Stone.
lol pig added a ":(" on the wiki
xD
beamed for leaking
soggggyc doggc
Yes you are
hello, FlochForster
Show that it exists
Can confirm, I see it on @Floch
very active in that channel on that acc
scathing
Its funny because my alt has fledgling
i got locked out of this acc for a few days and used my alt
I remember when 2 barb plaza and 2 mage ts worked and thought it was that and only that
nothing came to mind abt factions being irrelevant xD
the hunt for france
is your name a kid named finger reference
:fingerorb:
@Aviex roe jiden
Ok this new server pfp is extremely cool
the claimer doesnt need it
Wrong
jungle is the new nikitas
yes
Yea
No
imma ping
/boop cagirlLynn
you make me power (pls dont start a chain guys)
:feelsbadman:
Dueces confirmed an anonymous person requested him to make the hunt to torture pig because the anonymous person wanted to take revenge on pig (real and incredible)
When a cataclysmic happens ig
voball and lit flashbacks
no
you need the armor
Guys hear me out
Kuudra Mandible
I had it 6h ago
p me ign FlochForster
why are people like this
:sadge:
yoooo this marks my 10th relic
i think i can sell my divan's now and get a x655 (saving 700m - 900m)
noone got it because 2 ppl had to kill magma cubes
:sadge:
floch july/august mssgs feel like written by some insane maniac 💀💀💀💀
just believer took longer than dueces' estimate of the entire hunt :aware:
loremaster best
:doesheknow:
sailor wouldve been solved in less than an hour if he had the newly added dialogue originally lol
something around 1 - 3 months and not something like 13 hours or 8 months
yep
inv me if u need ppl to fill the lobby
FlochForster ign
Kuudra Mandible
t3 kuudra
:kekw:
power stone
ong fire veil goated
barb duke x is literally right click simulator
i love the hunt iterms
they are my favourite items
same, the final part was literally the best thing ever
kuudra follower sword and bow and staff when
dueces why did you decide against artifact having editions
fr, my friend lost their chestplate 😦
@midoriya_bala_tensa do this funny moment
great spook talis had editions tho
:sadge:
theres always the afker or the guy who griefs by not jumping and telling others not to jump
also is there any reasons why exactly jumping or just "cooperation"
i did the moment after hunt was solved
dueces there are people literally intentionally griefing and urging others not to jump its literally 10x more toxic than the average skyblock players' interaction XD
jacob did
with his "back to the mandible hunt folks"
you have stuff like hellstorm wand
which is also unobtainable
yea thats what i meant
atm its unobtainable.
dueces if you could, would you add the kuudra washing machine?
darq got it
a kraken
it would be called a humorous comedical hilarious moment
setup one in #LFG Thread
gg
Leaker
*beamed*
Furiously also did
carrot is a carrot
hello, "Carrot"
i am currently doing powder
we are both stuck in chollows hell
carrot how are things going with hotm
whats ur xp rn
and when do u plan on grinding next
@Chaos_Filter since you changed the other stuff, also make it so the unobtainable xp roles dont lock talking in those threads
SULPHUR EVOLUTION
gg
you make me power
thanks power
???
bruh its a placeholder pfp
just wanted to get rid of the goofy ahh peashooter because it makes me look stupid
:catyes:
@epoa add "the kuudra mandible is still to be discovered, jacob, dueces and landon are lying to us"
surely
mandible unobtainable
#kuudra-follower-lfg
dont ping another time there tho
just use that channel next time
get a reputation before you talk, cause in my eyes, you ain't got one. Maintain your position for a long time in relevancy, then we'll talk again
w h a t
@Balls, the Lore Expert you mined there i think?
how much did you get per hour?
Before or after compact
The brain supresses traumatic memories
BRO
mining speed doesnt affect netherrack
use a pioneer pickaxe
with compact
no, speed
use unyielding or prospector's reforge
Reforge at blacksmith
theyre the random reforges
use refined if u alr have 400 mf
why are you guys enriching and recombing it
:aware:
yes its unobtainable
#kuudra-follower-lfg
you literally cant
stuffy
Stuffy
Kuudra Electric Grill
Kuudra Pizza Oven
nope
You claimed Kuudra Relic!
#11
dugger shot DEAD
wait wait wait wait wait
BAN EVADING
@ pogoduck BAN HIM
boarpire?
o7
so uhhh
Kuudra Pizza Oven
*beamed*
jacob what are your opinions on the Kuudra Washing Machine
*surely*
this is the 11th time u pinged jacob
:linusweird:
yes it has no use (as you can see the hunt is done)
well its use was that the first ever herring unlocked sailor and thats it
I mean, kuudra follower artifact goog for t5, theres always gonna be kuudra sweats wanting it
god tier shitpost
Whoa this actually looks really cool
gj man 👍
There is no second hunt
mandible was confirmed to be unobtainable
theres nothing pointing to a hunt tho
i hope so
make everyone mine 5m netherrack :yep: :yep: :yep:
Also put in the editions thread
i have no life i spent 6 months hunting for a mandible which turned out to not exist
and i wouldnt decide to do anything else
mandible best
i refused to start hunting until it became non-linear
no
wrong
server
is this davidamaigo
he uses that skin
giv artifact editions :prayge: :prayge: :prayge:
Whats boots reqs now
its prob smth like 1m each now
20h for an edition that makes me vomit
:feelsbadman:
Where
And harassment
a lot of harassment
:pain:
oh wait climb u can get the full set now
since no divan drill req
archive this channel when
Its easy now
well the full set
artifact isnt
64 teeth tho
:pain:
I dont think hotm is still required even
Why would hotm7 still be required if divan drill isnt?
well, it was just an assumption
we will have to wait and see
:sotrue:
Agreed
People have had over half a year to get boots
hey @Carrot
no more hotm7
just be online during a relic ping
Prob still yea
I got divan drill to collect relics
yummy relics
Lobby swap
from experience it takes 30 mins - 1h to find one
archive this when
editions thread could be moved somewhere else
my predictions are 3m, 2.5m and 1m
2.5m imo is most likely
that guy partied me today
i have these slightly different colored strong boots that ive been refusing to sell to exotics collectors
and their inventory is full of exotics
duggy if you have any exotics thats why
there is a 7d cooldown between getting relics
cowshed invasion ‼️
Kuudra Electric Grill
1.3b clean lol
idk why theyre so expensive now
yea pig
its rude to gatekeep 😠
:fan_skeleton:
ill sell it for 5m
lf new hunt
-373 82 -880
you can only claim it during a cataclysmic eruption tho
no
just has to be elegant tux
can you tell me 30s b4 loremaster appears 😎
grab the cataclysmic ping role in #roles to get notified when one happens!
werent these removed?
where are they
i havent seen these since the hub revamp 💀
thought that update removed them
why lol
we will know on Tuesday when Loremaster appears
and Wet Napkin

any drill
no, those have been reduced too
we will know what theyve been reduced to on Tuesday
no
blazing fortress loremaster only appears on tuesdays
Can u dm me what it is 1 minute before loremaster appears 😎
As it's been said *multiple* times, we will only know on Tuesday whe Loremaster appears.
:pepeselfie:
*surely*
*surely*
:clueless:
the website in SuperDuggy117's about me has the setup for it
@SuperDuggy117's about me
in the tips section of the kuudra follower hunt section
I listened to SCP readings
guys i know the number too, ill tell
||dagame||
Is the number

mandible insanity
ONE OF US ONE OF US ONE OF US
soon™️

why did you reforge it why why why why why
no way is this famous wiki editor messisteve wtfrick
so sad i have to spend a whole 4 HOURS on netherrack 😭
No
You need to click on the bookshelf
shhhh
😔
5 for me
What happened here
Just get the cataclysmic ping role in #roles and wait for one to happen
oh
if you have the collection then u just need 16 stacks of e magma cream and e netherrack in ur inv
now talk to him 🙂
the blazing loremaster
did you do the chat trigger yet
THE BRIDGE IS COLLAPSING, GET TO THE CENTER!
say one of these 3 in front of him
does he appear in the blazing fortress for you
maybe you alr said those lines to him once
if it wasnt extremely obvious before, the asterisks in kuudra's eye's "* soulbound*" in description are not in bold, while all other soulbound items have it in bold, which is undeniable evidence kuudra's eye is fake
shhh they dont need to know
get cataclysmic ping role in #roles
then when someone finds one you will be pinged in #kuudra-follower-lfg
just talk to drakuu in full set
nothing else
#roles cataclysmic ping role
it will happen eventually
nop he doesnt have the role
wait jerry fiesta
:Pog:
i cant wait to make 200m
do not.
its best clean
i had to get mine when jumping was a thing 🥲
i will never forget evilsnowman1337
use a pioneer's pickaxe with unyielding reforge
for speed
Also level up compact on it
Unyielding for speed
no
its a hoax
the kuudra eye is REEAAAALLLL
it says 400h but its way over 1k
Thank you for that information.
exactly how i feel
Hunt was fun so good
OH NO! I have to spend 3-4h mining netherrack opposed to the previous 16-20h!
I need to think.
every tuesday
Make sure youve told the crimson isle one chat triggers and have 16 stacks of e magma and e rack in inv when claiming boots
you need 4000 intelligence not 4000 mana
which means you need 4100 mana
wait thats not alr there?
throwing smh
kuudra's eye is a forums hoax
nah its ok, many were decieved by kuudra's eye
:sotrue:
Me when "you don't have access to this link."
What
The kuura mandible is not real
:sotrue:
yeah
i got one ystrdy
you just have to ||lose the game|| to get kuudra eye
so easy
get the cataclysmic ping role in #roles and you will get pinged when someone finds one
the beth...
THE BETH IS REAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL
honestly forgot this npc existed lmao
[NPC] Alchemage: I just need one last thing, there's an extremely dangerous scientist who sells an assortment of items, he has a special rounded type of gold. Try to convince him to sell you it.
[NPC] Beth: He says he can't leave his house but I've seen him walking around all the time...

I may have just found how to get the kuudra mandible. if you follow the videos to get the chestplate, boots, and leggings, there is one piece left. The helmet. you get the helmet by helping this new lost adventurer npc in the hub get back to his home, the end island. but how do u get there? the items in shens auction. the wizard staff lets him teleport in time to get prepared, then he gets home u get the helmet and then u do the highest tier of kuudra beat it with the armor set on and the legendary kuudra pet on. then u get the kuudra mandible
meanies 😦
ok but why isnt his ban msg a sticker
what
what do you want from me
I love meth

Hes been begging for drill b4 he wanted legs
Divan drill is less than 1m more per hour than x655

#MAFINAMFORHUNTER2022
boarpire ded
you have problems
@Carrot ||y ou just losth gea ha,e||
@Deleted User how do you feel about @Carrot being a chester
chaos reference
i dont
thats the joke
:2Dumb_Bonk:
give dwagoon admin
so he can mass ping carrot and randomly ban people while making random words blacklisted that give u 7d timeout
but
but funny
@Deleted User do a funny
@Goat Girl Gwen do it 🥺
give the poor dwagoon human rights
he deserves them
then give me human rights
then give @midoriya_bala_tensa human rights
mean
oops
:greg:
@Goat Girl Gwen
make boarpire funny again
what was it
nelson
make boarpire fun
not 1984
i want "bad moderation" back
can we all agree on one thing please?
***CARROT.***
@Deleted User dont slam!
unless you ping carrot while slamming
1984
@Carrot
it wasnt meant to be the ping wall 💀
i had carrot ping on copy paste but forgor its a ping wall
anyways it would ping him only 1 time
truly one of the moments of all time
you know what else is amusing?
aqua being 17
what does that mean
the floor is made out of floor
:clueless:
btw
ik carrot is 84 years old
also he was born in 1984
carrot was born in 1984
and is 84 years old
the kuudra mandible is on my ceiling
i found it
oof a mod told dwagon to shut up
this is not gonna end well
tbh its prob gonna happen why are you bringing this up
why did you bring this up
i am dying rn
i will now proceed to avoid all non-hunt channels so something bad doesnt happen
dwagon you gave me an existential crisis
i will enjoy my last days
wtfrick
it could happen any time
in august i always rushed to grab my phone when i woke up to check if i was bannered yet or no
now same thing for role
dwagon frick you
ik!
but they could find a reason if they really wanted to
i am a naive individual
:clueless:
what is dn
what is ligma
i am an infant
(mentally)
ok what was sent was:
"DWAGOON SHUT THE FUCK UP"
i love this serer
where carrot pings
how funny would it be
if i lost hunter b4 sunday
dwagoon could decide to leak the entirety of boarpire
dwagoon moment
why the fuck did i even ever listen to anything he said
@mafinam @Deleted User @Goat Girl Gwen why boarpire shit in ohd
this server literally exists
ok im doing the chad move bearded did a LONG time ago
muting the casual category
i will rember to use my boar tho
ok goog
all i did here was cringe overload
does carrot ping textwall fall under a little silly or mentally deranged (asking about dwagoon not me)

Title:      Nineteen eighty-four
Author:     George Orwell (pseudonym of Eric Blair) (1903-1950)
PART ONE
Chapter 1
It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the
vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,
though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering
along with him.
The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a
coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.
It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a
man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome
features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even
at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric
current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive
in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,
who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went
slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the
lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was
one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about
when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.
Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had
something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an
oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface
of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank
somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument
(the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of
shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail
figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls
which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face
naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor
blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.
Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in
the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into
spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there
seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered
everywhere. The black-moustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding
corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER
IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into
Winston's own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner,
flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the
single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between
the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again
with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's
windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police
mattered.
Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away
about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The
telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston
made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it,
moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal
plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course
no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How
often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual
wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all
the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted
to. You had to live--did live, from habit that became instinct--in the
assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in
darkness, every movement scrutinized.
Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though, as he
well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of
Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.
This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste--this was London, chief
city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of
Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him
whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these
vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with
baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs
with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?
And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the
willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the
bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies
of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not
remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit
tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.
The Ministry of Truth--Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the official
language of Oceania. For an account of its structure and etymology see
Appendix.]--was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It
was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring
up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston
stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in
elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:
  WAR IS PEACE
  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above
ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London
there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So
completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof
of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They
were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus
of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself
with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of
Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which
maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible
for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv,
and Miniplenty.
The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows
in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor
within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except
on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of
barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Even
the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced
guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.
Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the
expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing
the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving
the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the
canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except
a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's
breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid
with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily
smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful,
nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.
Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The
stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the
sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The
next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world
began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet
marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the
tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful.
He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood
to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a
penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a
red back and a marbled cover.
For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual
position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where
it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the
window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston
was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been
intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well
back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so
far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed
in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual
geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now
about to do.
But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of
the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper,
a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for
at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much
older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little
junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not
now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire
to possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops
('dealing on the free market', it was called), but the rule was not
strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and
razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He
had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside
and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious
of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home
in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising
possession.
The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal
(nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected
it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least
by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into
the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic
instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one,
furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the
beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead
of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writing
by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything
into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present
purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a
second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the
decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:
   April 4th, 1984.
He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To
begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. It
must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was
thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but
it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.
For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary?
For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the
doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the
Newspeak word DOUBLETHINK. For the first time the magnitude of what he had
undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It
was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present,
in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it,
and his predicament would be meaningless.
For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The telescreen had
changed over to strident military music. It was curious that he seemed
not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have
forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks
past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed
his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing
would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable
restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for
years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. Moreover
his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it,
because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking
by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front
of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music,
and a slight booziness caused by the gin.
Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what
he was setting down. His small but childish handwriting straggled up and
down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its
full stops:
   April 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One very good
one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean.
Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away
with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the
water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights,
then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as
suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with
laughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a
helicopter hovering over it. there was a middle-aged woman might have been
a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in
her arms. little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her
breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting
her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright
herself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought
her arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a 20
kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood.
then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right up
into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it
up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in
the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting
they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint
right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her
out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles
say typical prole reaction they never----
Winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. He did
not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. But the curious
thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had
clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to
writing it down. It was, he now realized, because of this other incident
that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.
It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so nebulous could
be said to happen.
It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winston
worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them
in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for
the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the
middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken
to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often
passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she
worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably--since he had sometimes seen
her with oily hands and carrying a spanner--she had some mechanical job
on one of the novel-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of
about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic
movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was
wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to
bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the
very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the
atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general
clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked
nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always
the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted
adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and
nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression
of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor
she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into
him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even
crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That,
it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar
uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever
she was anywhere near him.
The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and
holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim
idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people
round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member
approaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse,
humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a
certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on
his nose which was curiously disarming--in some indefinable way, curiously
civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such
terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his
snuffbox. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many
years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued
by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's
physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhaps
not even a belief, merely a hope--that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was
not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again,
perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but
simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a
person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and
get him alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this
guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment O'Brien glanced
at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently
decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was
over. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away.
A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was
between them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.
The next moment a hideous, grinding screech, as of some monstrous machine
running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room.
It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the
back of one's neck. The Hate had started.
As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had
flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the
audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and
disgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago
(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading
figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and
then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned
to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes
of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in
which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor,
the earliest defiler of the Party's purity. All subsequent crimes against
the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations,
sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still
alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea,
under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even--so it was
occasionally rumoured--in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.
Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of
Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face,
with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard--a
clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile
silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles
was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a
sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack
upon the doctrines of the Party--an attack so exaggerated and perverse that
a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible
enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less
level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big
Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding
the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom
of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought,
he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed--and all
this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the
habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak
words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally
use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to
the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on
the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army--row
after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam
up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others
exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the
background to Goldstein's bleating voice.
Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable
exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.
The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power
of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides,
the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger
automatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia
or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was
generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although
Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a
thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers,
in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the
general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were--in spite of all this,
his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes
waiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs
acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police.
He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of
conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its
name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible
book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author
and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a
title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knew
of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor
THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if
there was a way of avoiding it.
In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping up and
down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort
to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The little
sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and
shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed.
He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and
quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The
dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!'
and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the
screen. It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued
inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the
others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The
horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to
act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining
in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous
ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash
faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of
people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into
a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an
abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to
another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred
was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against
Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his
heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian
of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he
was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein
seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big
Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an
invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes
of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and
the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister
enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure
of civilization.
It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that
by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one
wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded
in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired
girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.
He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked
to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would
ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before,
moreover, he realized WHY it was that he hated her. He hated her because
she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with
her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which
seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious
scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.
The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actual
sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.
Then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed
to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and
seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the
people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. But
in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the
hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired,
black-moustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that
it almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.
It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are
uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but
restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big
Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood
out in bold capitals:
  WAR IS PEACE
  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the
screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was
too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flung
herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a
tremulous murmur that sounded like 'My Saviour!' she extended her arms
towards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent
that she was uttering a prayer.
At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow,
rhythmical chant of 'B-B!...B-B!'--over and over again, very slowly, with a
long pause between the first 'B' and the second--a heavy, murmurous sound,
somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the
stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as
thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in
moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom
and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis,
a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.
Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could
not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of
'B-B!...B-B!' always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the
rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to
control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive
reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the
expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And it was
exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened--if, indeed,
it did happen.
Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stood up. He had taken
off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with
his characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when
their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew--yes, he
KNEW!--that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable
message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the
thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. 'I am
with you,' O'Brien seemed to be saying to him. 'I know precisely what you
are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.
But don't worry, I am on your side!' And then the flash of intelligence
was gone, and O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.
That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such
incidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep alive in him
the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the
Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after
all--perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite
of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the
Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days
not. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything
or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory
walls--once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand
which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all
guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his
cubicle without looking at O'Brien again. The idea of following up their
momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably
dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two
seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of
the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in
which one had to live.
Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a belch. The gin
was rising from his stomach.
His eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that while he sat helplessly
musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action. And it was
no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slid
voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals--
  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
over and over again, filling half a page.
He could not help feeling a twinge of panic. It was absurd, since the
writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial
act of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the
spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.
He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. Whether he
wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he refrained from writing it, made
no difference. Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go
on with it, made no difference. The Thought Police would get him just the
same. He had committed--would still have committed, even if he had never
set pen to paper--the essential crime that contained all others in itself.
Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be
concealed for ever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for
years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.
It was always at night--the arrests invariably happened at night. The
sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights
glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. In the vast
majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. People
simply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed from the
registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your
one-time existence was denied and then forgotten. You were abolished,
annihilated: VAPORIZED was the usual word.
For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began writing in a
hurried untidy scrawl:
   theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i
dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the
neck i dont care down with big brother----
He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down
the pen. The next moment he started violently. There was a knocking at
the door.
Already! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was
might go away after a single attempt. But no, the knocking was repeated.
The worst thing of all would be to delay. His heart was thumping like a
drum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless. He got
up and moved heavily towards the door.
Chapter 2
As he put his hand to the door-knob Winston saw that he had left the
diary open on the table. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written all over it,
in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. It was an
inconceivably stupid thing to have done. But, he realized, even in his
panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book
while the ink was wet.
He drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly a warm wave of relief
flowed through him. A colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair
and a lined face, was standing outside.
'Oh, comrade,' she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, 'I thought I
heard you come in. Do you think you could come across and have a look at
our kitchen sink? It's got blocked up and----'
It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor. ('Mrs' was
a word somewhat discountenanced by the Party--you were supposed to call
everyone 'comrade'--but with some women one used it instinctively.) She was
a woman of about thirty, but looking much older. One had the impression
that there was dust in the creases of her face. Winston followed her down
the passage. These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation.
Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were
falling to pieces. The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls,
the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was
snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not
closed down altogether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what you
could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which
were liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years.
'Of course it's only because Tom isn't home,' said Mrs Parsons vaguely.
The Parsons' flat was bigger than Winston's, and dingy in a different
way. Everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the
place had just been visited by some large violent animal. Games
impedimenta--hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves, a burst football, a pair of
sweaty shorts turned inside out--lay all over the floor, and on the
table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books.
On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, and
a full-sized poster of Big Brother. There was the usual boiled-cabbage
smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper
reek of sweat, which--one knew this at the first sniff, though it was
hard to say how--was the sweat of some person not present at the moment.
In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was
trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing
from the telescreen.
'It's the children,' said Mrs Parsons, casting a half-apprehensive glance
at the door. 'They haven't been out today. And of course----'
She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. The kitchen
sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt
worse than ever of cabbage. Winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint
of the pipe. He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was
always liable to start him coughing. Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly.
'Of course if Tom was home he'd put it right in a moment,' she said.
'He loves anything like that. He's ever so good with his hands, Tom is.'
Parsons was Winston's fellow-employee at the Ministry of Truth. He was
a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile
enthusiasms--one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on
whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party
depended. At thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the
Youth League, and before graduating into the Youth League he had managed to
stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age. At the Ministry
he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not
required, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the Sports
Committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community
hikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary
activities generally. He would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs
of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the Community Centre every
evening for the past four years. An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of
unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him about
wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone.
'Have you got a spanner?' said Winston, fiddling with the nut on the
angle-joint.
'A spanner,' said Mrs Parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate. 'I don't
know, I'm sure. Perhaps the children----'
There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the
children charged into the living-room. Mrs Parsons brought the spanner.
Winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair
that had blocked up the pipe. He cleaned his fingers as best he could in
the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room.
'Up with your hands!' yelled a savage voice.
A handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table
and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his small sister,
about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood.
Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and red
neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies. Winston raised his hands
above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boy's
demeanour, that it was not altogether a game.
'You're a traitor!' yelled the boy. 'You're a thought-criminal! You're a
Eurasian spy! I'll shoot you, I'll vaporize you, I'll send you to the salt
mines!'
Suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting 'Traitor!' and
'Thought-criminal!' the little girl imitating her brother in every
movement. It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of
tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort of
calculating ferocity in the boy's eye, a quite evident desire to hit or
kick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so.
It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston thought.
Mrs Parsons' eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children, and back
again. In the better light of the living-room he noticed with interest
that there actually was dust in the creases of her face.
'They do get so noisy,' she said. 'They're disappointed because they
couldn't go to see the hanging, that's what it is. I'm too busy to take
them. and Tom won't be back from work in time.'
'Why can't we go and see the hanging?' roared the boy in his huge voice.
'Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!' chanted the little
girl, still capering round.
Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the
Park that evening, Winston remembered. This happened about once a month,
and was a popular spectacle. Children always clamoured to be taken to see
it. He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door. But he had not
gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an
agonizingly painful blow. It was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed
into him. He spun round just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her son
back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.
'Goldstein!' bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. But what most
struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman's greyish face.
Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the
table again, still rubbing his neck. The music from the telescreen had
stopped. Instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a sort of
brutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress
which had just been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands.
With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of
terror. Another year, two years, and they would be watching her night
and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were
horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as
the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages,
and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the
discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and
everything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, the
hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship
of Big Brother--it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their
ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against
foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal
for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And with
good reason, for hardly a week passed in which 'The Times' did not carry
a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak--'child hero'
was the phrase generally used--had overheard some compromising remark
and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.
The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked up his pen
half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to write
in the diary. Suddenly he began thinking of O'Brien again.
Years ago--how long was it? Seven years it must be--he had dreamed that he
was walking through a pitch-dark room. And someone sitting to one side of
him had said as he passed: 'We shall meet in the place where there is no
darkness.' It was said very quietly, almost casually--a statement, not a
command. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was that at the
time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. It was
only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. He
could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that
he had seen O'Brien for the first time, nor could he remember when he had
first identified the voice as O'Brien's. But at any rate the identification
existed. It was O'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.
Winston had never been able to feel sure--even after this morning's flash
of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O'Brien was a friend
or an enemy. Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There was a link of
understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship.
'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' he had said.
Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it
would come true.
The voice from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call, clear and beautiful,
floated into the stagnant air. The voice continued raspingly:
'Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has this moment arrived
from the Malabar front. Our forces in South India have won a glorious
victory. I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may
well bring the war within measurable distance of its end. Here is the
newsflash----'
Bad news coming, thought Winston. And sure enough, following on a gory
description of the annihilation of a Eurasian army, with stupendous figures
of killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next week,
the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.
Winston belched again. The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling.
The telescreen--perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown the
memory of the lost chocolate--crashed into 'Oceania, 'tis for thee'. You
were supposed to stand to attention. However, in his present position he
was invisible.
'Oceania, 'tis for thee' gave way to lighter music. Winston walked over to
the window, keeping his back to the telescreen. The day was still cold and
clear. Somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating
roar. About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London at
present.
Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and the
word INGSOC fitfully appeared and vanished. Ingsoc. The sacred principles
of Ingsoc. Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past. He felt as
though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a
monstrous world where he himself was the monster. He was alone. The past
was dead, the future was unimaginable. What certainty had he that a single
human creature now living was on his side? And what way of knowing that the
dominion of the Party would not endure FOR EVER? Like an answer, the three
slogans on the white face of the Ministry of Truth came back to him:
  WAR IS PEACE
  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
He took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket. There, too, in tiny
clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of
the coin the head of Big Brother. Even from the coin the eyes pursued you.
On coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on
the wrappings of a cigarette packet--everywhere. Always the eyes watching
you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, working or eating,
indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed--no escape. Nothing was your
own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.
The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the Ministry of Truth,
with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of a
fortress. His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. It was too
strong, it could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not batter
it down. He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary. For the
future, for the past--for an age that might be imaginary. And in front of
him there lay not death but annihilation. The diary would be reduced to
ashes and himself to vapour. Only the Thought Police would read what he had
written, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory. How could
you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an
anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive?
The telescreen struck fourteen. He must leave in ten minutes. He had to be
back at work by fourteen-thirty.
Curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him.
He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear. But so
long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken.
It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on
the human heritage. He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote:
   To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men
are different from one another and do not live alone--to a time when truth
exists and what is done cannot be undone:
   From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of
Big Brother, from the age of doublethink--greetings!
He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that it was only now,
when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken
the decisive step. The consequences of every act are included in the act
itself. He wrote:
   Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.
Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay
alive as long as possible. Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained.
It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. Some nosing zealot
in the Ministry (a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-haired
woman or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department) might start
wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he had
used an old-fashioned pen, WHAT he had been writing--and then drop a hint
in the appropriate quarter. He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed
the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped your skin like
sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose.
He put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite useless to think of
hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had
been discovered. A hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious. With the
tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and
deposited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shaken
off if the book was moved.
Chapter 3
Winston was dreaming of his mother.
He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had
disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow
movements and magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered more vaguely
as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered
especially the very thin soles of his father's shoes) and wearing
spectacles. The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one
of the first great purges of the fifties.
At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him,
with his young sister in her arms. He did not remember his sister at all,
except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes.
Both of them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean
place--the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave--but it
was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards.
They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the
darkening water. There was still air in the saloon, they could still see
him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into the
green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever.
He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death,
and they were down there because he was up here. He knew it and they knew
it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no reproach
either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they
must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of
the unavoidable order of things.
He could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in
some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his
own. It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic
dream scenery, are a continuation of one's intellectual life, and in which
one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable
after one is awake. The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his
mother's death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in
a way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the
ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship,
and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to
know the reason. His mother's memory tore at his heart because she had died
loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and
because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a
conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he
saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but
no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed to
see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him
through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.
Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when
the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. The landscape that he was
looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain
whether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he
called it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a
foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged
hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were
swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense
masses like women's hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight,
there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the
pools under the willow trees.
The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. With
what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them
disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire
in him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant
was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside.
With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture,
a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the
Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid
movement of the arm. That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time.
Winston woke up with the word 'Shakespeare' on his lips.
The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on
the same note for thirty seconds. It was nought seven fifteen, getting-up
time for office workers. Winston wrenched his body out of bed--naked, for
a member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually,
and a suit of pyjamas was 600--and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of
shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in
three minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit
which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs
so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back
and taking a series of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort of
the cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching.
'Thirty to forty group!' yapped a piercing female voice. 'Thirty to forty
group! Take your places, please. Thirties to forties!'
Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the
image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic and
gym-shoes, had already appeared.
'Arms bending and stretching!' she rapped out. 'Take your time by me. ONE,
two, three, four! ONE, two, three, four! Come on, comrades, put a bit of
life into it! ONE, two, three four! ONE two, three, four!...'
The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Winston's mind the
impression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exercise
restored it somewhat. As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth,
wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper
during the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into
the dim period of his early childhood. It was extraordinarily difficult.
Beyond the late fifties everything faded. When there were no external
records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost
its sharpness. You remembered huge events which had quite probably not
happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to
recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you
could assign nothing. Everything had been different then. Even the names of
countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One,
for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called
England or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been
called London.
Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been
at war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of
peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an air
raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the time
when the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester. He did not remember the raid
itself, but he did remember his father's hand clutching his own as they
hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round
a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied
his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest. His
mother, in her slow, dreamy way, was following a long way behind them. She
was carrying his baby sister--or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets
that she was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been born
then. Finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had
realized to be a Tube station.
There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, and other
people, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one above
the other. Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on
the floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by
side on a bunk. The old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap
pushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes were
blue and full of tears. He reeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his
skin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears welling
from his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly drunk he was also
suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. In his childish
way Winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyond
forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened. It also seemed
to him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the old man loved--a little
granddaughter, perhaps--had been killed. Every few minutes the old man kept
repeating:
'We didn't ought to 'ave trusted 'em. I said so, Ma, didn't I? That's what
comes of trusting 'em. I said so all along. We didn't ought to 'ave trusted
the buggers.'
But which buggers they didn't ought to have trusted Winston could not now
remember.
Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly
speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his
childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some
of which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole
period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been
utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made
mention of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for
example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and
in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever
admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different
lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania
had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was
merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because
his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of
partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore
Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always
represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future
agreement with him was impossible.
The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he
forced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they were
gyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be
good for the back muscles)--the frightening thing was that it might all be
true. If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or
that event, IT NEVER HAPPENED--that, surely, was more terrifying than mere
torture and death?
The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He,
Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short
a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his
own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all
others accepted the lie which the Party imposed--if all records told the
same tale--then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controls
the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the
present controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its nature
alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from
everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was
an unending series of victories over your own memory. 'Reality control',
they called it: in Newspeak, 'doublethink'.
'Stand easy!' barked the instructress, a little more genially.
Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air.
His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. To know
and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling
carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which
cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of
them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim
to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the
guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then
to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and
then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process
to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to
induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of
the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word
'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.
The instructress had called them to attention again. 'And now let's see
which of us can touch our toes!' she said enthusiastically. 'Right over
from the hips, please, comrades. ONE-two! ONE-two!...'
Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way from
his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing
fit. The half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations. The past, he
reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. For
how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no
record outside your own memory? He tried to remember in what year he had
first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some
time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party
histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the
Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually
pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous
world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their
strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in great
gleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides. There was no
knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented. Winston
could not even remember at what date the Party itself had come into
existence. He did not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before
1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak form--'English Socialism',
that is to say--it had been current earlier. Everything melted into mist.
Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was not
true, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that the
Party had invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest
childhood. But you could prove nothing. There was never any evidence. Just
once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary
proof of the falsification of an historical fact. And on that occasion----
'Smith!' screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.!
Yes, YOU! Bend lower, please! You can do better than that. You're not
trying. Lower, please! THAT'S better, comrade. Now stand at ease, the
whole squad, and watch me.'
A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston's body. His face
remained completely inscrutable. Never show dismay! Never show resentment!
A single flicker of the eyes could give you away. He stood watching while
the instructress raised her arms above her head and--one could not say
gracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency--bent over and
tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes.
'THERE, comrades! THAT'S how I want to see you doing it. Watch me again.
I'm thirty-nine and I've had four children. Now look.' She bent over again.
'You see MY knees aren't bent. You can all do it if you want to,' she added
as she straightened herself up. 'Anyone under forty-five is perfectly
capable of touching his toes. We don't all have the privilege of fighting
in the front line, but at least we can all keep fit. Remember our boys on
the Malabar front! And the sailors in the Floating Fortresses! Just think
what THEY have to put up with. Now try again. That's better, comrade,
that's MUCH better,' she added encouragingly as Winston, with a violent
lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first
time in several years.
Chapter 4
With the deep, unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the
telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day's work started,
Winston pulled the speakwrite towards him, blew the dust from its
mouthpiece, and put on his spectacles. Then he unrolled and clipped
together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of
the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk.
In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of the
speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, a
larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of
Winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last
was for the disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or
tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at
short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed
memory holes. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or
even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic
action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in,
whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous
furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.
Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled. Each
contained a message of only one or two lines, in the abbreviated
jargon--not actually Newspeak, but consisting
largely of Newspeak words--which was used in the Ministry for internal
purposes. They ran:
times 17.3.84 bb speech malreported africa rectify
times 19.12.83 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify current issue
times 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify
times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite
fullwise upsub antefiling
With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth message aside.
It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last.
The other three were routine matters, though the second one would probably
mean some tedious wading through lists of figures.
Winston dialled 'back numbers' on the telescreen and called for the
appropriate issues of 'The Times', which slid out of the pneumatic tube
after only a few minutes' delay. The messages he had received referred to
articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought
necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. For
example, it appeared from 'The Times' of the seventeenth of March that Big
Brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the South
Indian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly
be launched in North Africa. As it happened, the Eurasian Higher Command
had launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone. It
was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother's speech, in
such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. Or
again, 'The Times' of the nineteenth of December had published the official
forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the
fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth
Three-Year Plan. Today's issue contained a statement of the actual output,
from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly
wrong. Winston's job was to rectify the original figures by making them
agree with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a very
simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short
a time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise
(a 'categorical pledge' were the official words) that there would be
no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston
was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes
to twenty at the end of the present week. All that was needed was to
substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be
necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.
As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his
speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of 'The Times' and pushed
them into the pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as
possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes
that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be
devoured by the flames.
What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he
did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as all
the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number
of 'The Times' had been assembled and collated, that number would be
reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on
the files in its stead. This process of continuous alteration was applied
not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters,
leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs--to every kind of
literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or
ideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute the past
was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party
could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was any
item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the
needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was
a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was
necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done,
to prove that any falsification had taken place. The largest section of
the Records Department, far larger than the one on which Winston worked,
consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all
copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded
and were due for destruction. A number of 'The Times' which might, because
of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big
Brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing
its original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. Books, also,
were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued
without any admission that any alteration had been made. Even the written
instructions which Winston received, and which he invariably got rid of
as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of
forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors,
misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the
interests of accuracy.
But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty's
figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one
piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing
with had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of
connexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much
a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great
deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For
example, the Ministry of Plenty's forecast had estimated the output of
boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was given as
sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked
the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim
that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was
no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions. Very
likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew
how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every
quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps
half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every
class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a
shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become
uncertain.
Winston glanced across the hall. In the corresponding cubicle on the other
side a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned man named Tillotson was working
steadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close
to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the air of trying to keep what
he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. He looked up,
and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in Winston's direction.
Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed
on. People in the Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs.
In the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its
endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites,
there were quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name,
though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or
gesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in the cubicle next
to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply at
tracking down and deleting from the Press the names of people who had been
vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. There was a
certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple
of years earlier. And a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy
creature named Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent
for juggling with rhymes and metres, was engaged in producing garbled
versions--definitive texts, they were called--of poems which had become
ideologically offensive, but which for one reason or another were to be
retained in the anthologies. And this hall, with its fifty workers or
thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in the
huge complexity of the Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were other
swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. There were
the huge printing-shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts,
and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs. There
was the tele-programmes section with its engineers, its producers, and its
teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. There
were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists
of books and periodicals which were due for recall. There were the vast
repositories where the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden
furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. And somewhere or other,
quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who co-ordinated the whole
effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this
fragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, and the other
rubbed out of existence.
And the Records Department, after all, was itself only a single branch of
the Ministry of Truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past
but to supply the citizens of Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks,
telescreen programmes, plays, novels--with every conceivable kind of
information, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a slogan,
from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from a child's
spelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary. And the Ministry had not only to
supply the multifarious needs of the party, but also to repeat the whole
operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat. There
was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian
literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here were produced
rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime and
astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and
sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a
special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator. There was even
a whole sub-section--Pornosec, it was called in Newspeak--engaged in
producing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed
packets and which no Party member, other than those who worked on it,
was permitted to look at.
Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while Winston was
working, but they were simple matters, and he had disposed of them before
the Two Minutes Hate interrupted him. When the Hate was over he returned
to his cubicle, took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed the
speakwrite to one side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to his
main job of the morning.
Winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work. Most of it was a
tedious routine, but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and
intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a
mathematical problem--delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing
to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and your
estimate of what the Party wanted you to say. Winston was good at this kind
of thing. On occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of
'The Times' leading articles, which were written entirely in Newspeak.
He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier. It ran:
   times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons
rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling
In Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be rendered:
The reporting of Big Brother's Order for the Day in 'The Times' of December
3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non-existent
persons. Rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority
before filing.
Winston read through the offending article. Big Brother's Order for the
Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an
organization known as FFCC, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts
to the sailors in the Floating Fortresses. A certain Comrade Withers, a
prominent member of the Inner Party, had been singled out for special
mention and awarded a decoration, the Order of Conspicuous Merit, Second
Class.
Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given.
One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in disgrace, but
there had been no report of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen.
That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to
be put on trial or even publicly denounced. The great purges involving
thousands of people, with public trials of traitors and thought-criminals
who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed,
were special show-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of
years. More commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the
Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never had the
smallest clue as to what had happened to them. In some cases they might
not even be dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston, not
counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another.
Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In the cubicle
across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively over
his speakwrite. He raised his head for a moment: again the hostile
spectacle-flash. Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged
on the same job as himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece
of work would never be entrusted to a single person: on the other hand,
to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of
fabrication was taking place. Very likely as many as a dozen people were
now working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said.
And presently some master brain in the Inner Party would select this
version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion the complex processes
of cross-referencing that would be required, and then the chosen lie
would pass into the permanent records and become truth.
Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced. Perhaps it was for
corruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big Brother was merely getting rid of
a too-popular subordinate. Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had
been suspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps--what was likeliest of
all--the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a
necessary part of the mechanics of government. The only real clue lay in
the words 'refs unpersons', which indicated that Withers was already dead.
You could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were
arrested. Sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty
for as much as a year or two years before being executed. Very occasionally
some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly
reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of
others by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever. Withers,
however, was already an UNPERSON. He did not exist: he had never existed.
Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency
of Big Brother's speech. It was better to make it deal with something
totally unconnected with its original subject.
He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and
thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent a
victory at the front, or some triumph of over-production in the Ninth
Three-Year Plan, might complicate the records too much. What was needed
was a piece of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready
made as it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had recently
died in battle, in heroic circumstances. There were occasions when Big
Brother devoted his Order for the Day to commemorating some humble,
rank-and-file Party member whose life and death he held up as an example
worthy to be followed. Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. It was
true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of
print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into
existence.
Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him and
began dictating in Big Brother's familiar style: a style at once military
and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then
promptly answering them ('What lessons do we learn from this fact,
comrades? The lesson--which is also one of the fundamental principles
of Ingsoc--that,' etc., etc.), easy to imitate.
At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a
sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter. At six--a year early, by a special
relaxation of the rules--he had joined the Spies, at nine he had been a
troop leader. At eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police
after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal
tendencies. At seventeen he had been a district organizer of the Junior
Anti-Sex League. At nineteen he had designed a hand-grenade which had
been adopted by the Ministry of Peace and which, at its first trial, had
killed thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one burst. At twenty-three he had
perished in action. Pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the
Indian Ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with his
machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches
and all--an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossible to contemplate
without feelings of envy. Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity
and single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy's life. He was a total abstainer
and a nonsmoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium,
and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the care of a
family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty.
He had no subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc, and
no aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-down
of spies, saboteurs, thought-criminals, and traitors generally.
Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order of
Conspicuous Merit: in the end he decided against it because of the
unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail.
Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. Something
seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the same job
as himself. There was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted,
but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade Ogilvy,
unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck him as curious that you
could create dead men but not living ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had never
existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of
forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the
same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.
Chapter 5
In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the lunch queue jerked
slowly forward. The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. From
the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour
metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. On
the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall,
where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.
'Just the man I was looking for,' said a voice at Winston's back.
He turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked in the Research
Department. Perhaps 'friend' was not exactly the right word. You did not
have friends nowadays, you had comrades: but there were some comrades whose
society was pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist, a
specialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was one of the enormous team of experts
now engaged in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary.
He was a tiny creature, smaller than Winston, with dark hair and large,
protuberant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed to search
your face closely while he was speaking to you.
'I wanted to ask you whether you'd got any razor blades,' he said.
'Not one!' said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. 'I've tried all over
the place. They don't exist any longer.'
Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually he had two unused ones
which he was hoarding up. There had been a famine of them for months past.
At any given moment there was some necessary article which the Party shops
were unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darning
wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present it was razor blades. You could
only get hold of them, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on
the 'free' market.
'I've been using the same blade for six weeks,' he added untruthfully.
The queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted he turned and faced
Syme again. Each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end
of the counter.
'Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?' said Syme.
'I was working,' said Winston indifferently. 'I shall see it on the
flicks, I suppose.'
'A very inadequate substitute,' said Syme.
His mocking eyes roved over Winston's face. 'I know you,' the eyes seemed
to say, 'I see through you. I know very well why you didn't go to see
those prisoners hanged.' In an intellectual way, Syme was venomously
orthodox. He would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of
helicopter raids on enemy villages, and trials and confessions of
thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the Ministry of Love.
Talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects
and entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities of Newspeak, on
which he was authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his head a
little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.
'It was a good hanging,' said Syme reminiscently. 'I think it spoils it
when they tie their feet together. I like to see them kicking. And above
all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue--a quite bright
blue. That's the detail that appeals to me.'
'Nex', please!' yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle.
Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. On to each was
dumped swiftly the regulation lunch--a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew,
a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory Coffee, and
one saccharine tablet.
'There's a table over there, under that telescreen,' said Syme. 'Let's pick
up a gin on the way.'
The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. They threaded
their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the
metal-topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew,
a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston took up his
mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the
oily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he
suddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of
the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy
pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. Neither of them
spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. From the table at
Winston's left, a little behind his back, someone was talking rapidly and
continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, which
pierced the general uproar of the room.
'How is the Dictionary getting on?' said Winston, raising his voice to
overcome the noise.
'Slowly,' said Syme. 'I'm on the adjectives. It's fascinating.'
He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak. He pushed his
pannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his
cheese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak
without shouting.
'The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,' he said. 'We're getting
the language into its final shape--the shape it's going to have when nobody
speaks anything else. When we've finished with it, people like you will
have to learn it all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job
is inventing new words. But not a bit of it! We're destroying words--scores
of them, hundreds of them, every day. We're cutting the language down to
the bone. The Eleventh Edition won't contain a single word that will become
obsolete before the year 2050.'
He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, then
continued speaking, with a sort of pedant's passion. His thin dark face
had become animated, his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown
almost dreamy.
'It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great
wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns
that can be got rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms; there are also
the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is
simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in
itself. Take "good", for instance. If you have a word like "good", what
need is there for a word like "bad"? "Ungood" will do just as well--better,
because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you
want a stronger version of "good", what sense is there in having a whole
string of vague useless words like "excellent" and "splendid" and all the
rest of them? "Plusgood" covers the meaning, or "doubleplusgood" if you
want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already. but
in the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else. In the end the
whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words--in
reality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was
B.B.'s idea originally, of course,' he added as an afterthought.
A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston's face at the mention of
Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack of
enthusiasm.
'You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,' he said almost
sadly. 'Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak. I've read
some of those pieces that you write in "The Times" occasionally. They're
good enough, but they're translations. In your heart you'd prefer to stick
to Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning.
You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. Do you know that
Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller
every year?'
Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not
trusting himself to speak. Syme bit off another fragment of the
dark-coloured bread, chewed it briefly, and went on:
'Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of
thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible,
because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that
can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning
rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten.
Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we're not far from that point. But the
process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year
fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little
smaller. Even now, of course, there's no reason or excuse for committing
thoughtcrime. It's merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control.
But in the end there won't be any need even for that. The Revolution will
be complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc
is Newspeak,' he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. 'Has it ever
occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a
single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation
as we are having now?'
'Except----' began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.
It had been on the tip of his tongue to say 'Except the proles,' but he
checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in
some way unorthodox. Syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.
'The proles are not human beings,' he said carelessly. 'By 2050--earlier,
probably--all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole
literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare,
Milton, Byron--they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed
into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory
of what they used to be. Even the literature of the Party will change.
Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like "freedom is
slavery" when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The whole climate
of thought will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as we
understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think.
Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.'
One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme will
be vaporized. He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too
plainly. The Party does not like such people. One day he will disappear.
It is written in his face.
Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned a little sideways
in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At the table on his left the man
with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. A young
woman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back
to Winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with
everything that he said. From time to time Winston caught some such remark
as 'I think you're so right, I do so agree with you', uttered in a youthful
and rather silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an
instant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the man by sight,
though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post
in the Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular
throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and
because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the
light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What was
slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of
his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just
once Winston caught a phrase--'complete and final elimination of
Goldsteinism'--jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece,
like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a
quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what the
man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature.
He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against
thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the
atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the
heroes on the Malabar front--it made no difference. Whatever it was, you
could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc.
As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down,
Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but
some kind of dummy. It was not the man's brain that was speaking, it was
his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but
it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in
unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.
Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was
tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. The voice from the other table
quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.
'There is a word in Newspeak,' said Syme, 'I don't know whether you know
it: DUCKSPEAK, to quack like a duck. It is one of those interesting words
that have two contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse,
applied to someone you agree with, it is praise.'
Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again. He thought
it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised him
and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a
thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something
subtly wrong with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion,
aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he was
unorthodox. He believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big
Brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with
sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of
information, which the ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet a faint
air of disreputability always clung to him. He said things that would have
been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut
Tree Cafe, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law, not even an
unwritten law, against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe, yet the place
was somehow ill-omened. The old, discredited leaders of the Party had been
used to gather there before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself,
it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. Syme's
fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it was a fact that if Syme
grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston's, secret
opinions, he would betray him instantly to the Thought Police. So would
anybody else, for that matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was not
enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.
Syme looked up. 'Here comes Parsons,' he said.
Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, 'that bloody fool'.
Parsons, Winston's fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions, was in fact threading
his way across the room--a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a
froglike face. At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at
neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. His whole
appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although
he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to
think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red
neckerchief of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a picture of
dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did,
indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other
physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He greeted them both
with a cheery 'Hullo, hullo!' and sat down at the table, giving off an
intense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face.
His powers of sweating were extraordinary. At the Community Centre you
could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of
the bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a
long column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his
fingers.
'Look at him working away in the lunch hour,' said Parsons, nudging
Winston. 'Keenness, eh? What's that you've got there, old boy? Something
a bit too brainy for me, I expect. Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why I'm
chasing you. It's that sub you forgot to give me.'
'Which sub is that?' said Winston, automatically feeling for money. About
a quarter of one's salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions,
which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them.
'For Hate Week. You know--the house-by-house fund. I'm treasurer for our
block. We're making an all-out effort--going to put on a tremendous show.
I tell you, it won't be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn't have the
biggest outfit of flags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me.'
Winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which Parsons
entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.
'By the way, old boy,' he said. 'I hear that little beggar of mine let fly
at you with his catapult yesterday. I gave him a good dressing-down for it.
In fact I told him I'd take the catapult away if he does it again.'
'I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,' said
Winston.
'Ah, well--what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn't it?
Mischievous little beggars they are, both of them, but talk about keenness!
All they think about is the Spies, and the war, of course. D'you know what
that little girl of mine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike
out Berkhamsted way? She got two other girls to go with her, slipped off
from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. They
kept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, when
they got into Amersham, handed him over to the patrols.'
'What did they do that for?' said Winston, somewhat taken aback. Parsons
went on triumphantly:
'My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent--might have been dropped
by parachute, for instance. But here's the point, old boy. What do you
think put her on to him in the first place? She spotted he was wearing a
funny kind of shoes--said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that
before. So the chances were he was a foreigner. Pretty smart for a nipper
of seven, eh?'
'What happened to the man?' said Winston.
'Ah, that I couldn't say, of course. But I wouldn't be altogether surprised
if----' Parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue
for the explosion.
'Good,' said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.
'Of course we can't afford to take chances,' agreed Winston dutifully.
'What I mean to say, there is a war on,' said Parsons.
As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the
telescreen just above their heads. However, it was not the proclamation of
a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the Ministry
of Plenty.
'Comrades!' cried an eager youthful voice. 'Attention, comrades! We have
glorious news for you. We have won the battle for production! Returns now
completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the
standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past
year. All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous
demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and
paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to Big
Brother for the new, happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed
upon us. Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs----'
The phrase 'our new, happy life' recurred several times. It had been a
favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attention
caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity,
a sort of edified boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he was
aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged
out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco.
With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to
fill a pipe to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he
held carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and
he had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears to
the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the
telescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank
Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And
only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was
to be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that they could
swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons
swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature
at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious
desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that
last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too--in some more
complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, ALONE
in the possession of a memory?
The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. As
compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses,
more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters,
more books, more babies--more of everything except disease, crime, and
insanity. Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was
whizzing rapidly upwards. As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up
his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across
the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. He meditated
resentfully on the physical texture of life. Had it always been like
this? Had food always tasted like this? He looked round the canteen.
A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of
innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close
together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays,
coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a
sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and
dirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort
of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had
a right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly
different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never
been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that
were not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety,
rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces,
bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes
insufficient--nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. And though,
of course, it grew worse as one's body aged, was it not a sign that this
was NOT the natural order of things, if one's heart sickened at the
discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness
of one's socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty
soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil
tastes? Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind
of ancestral memory that things had once been different?
He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was ugly, and would
still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue
overalls. On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small,
curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes
darting suspicious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought
Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type
set up by the Party as an ideal--tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed
maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree--existed and even
predominated. Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people
in Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured. It was curious how that
beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growing
stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and
fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to
flourish best under the dominion of the Party.
The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet call
and gave way to tinny music. Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the
bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.
'The Ministry of Plenty's certainly done a good job this year,' he said
with a knowing shake of his head. 'By the way, Smith old boy, I suppose
you haven't got any razor blades you can let me have?'
'Not one,' said Winston. 'I've been using the same blade for six weeks
myself.'
'Ah, well--just thought I'd ask you, old boy.'
'Sorry,' said Winston.
The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the
Ministry's announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. For some
reason Winston suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her
wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. Within two years those
children would be denouncing her to the Thought Police. Mrs Parsons would
be vaporized. Syme would be vaporized. Winston would be vaporized. O'Brien
would be vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.
The eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized.
The little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine
corridors of Ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. And the girl
with dark hair, the girl from the Fiction Department--she would never be
vaporized either. It seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would
survive and who would perish: though just what it was that made for
survival, it was not easy to say.
At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. The
girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. It
was the girl with dark hair. She was looking at him in a sidelong way, but
with curious intensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked away
again.
The sweat started out on Winston's backbone. A horrible pang of terror
went through him. It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging
uneasiness behind. Why was she watching him? Why did she keep following him
about? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at
the table when he arrived, or had come there afterwards. But yesterday, at
any rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him
when there was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real object had
been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough.
His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member
of the Thought Police, but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was
the greatest danger of all. He did not know how long she had been looking
at him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was possible
that his features had not been perfectly under control. It was terribly
dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place
or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away.
A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to
yourself--anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of
having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on
your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example)
was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in Newspeak:
FACECRIME, it was called.
The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after all she was not
really following him about, perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so
close to him two days running. His cigarette had gone out, and he laid it
carefully on the edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work,
if he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at the next
table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely he would be in the
cellars of the Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette end
must not be wasted. Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it
away in his pocket. Parsons had begun talking again.
'Did I ever tell you, old boy,' he said, chuckling round the stem of his
pipe, 'about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old
market-woman's skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster
of B.B.? Sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches.
Burned her quite badly, I believe. Little beggars, eh? But keen as mustard!
That's a first-rate training they give them in the Spies nowadays--better
than in my day, even. What d'you think's the latest thing they've served
them out with? Ear trumpets for listening through keyholes! My little
girl brought one home the other night--tried it out on our sitting-room
door, and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the
hole. Of course it's only a toy, mind you. Still, gives 'em the right
idea, eh?'
At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. It was the
signal to return to work. All three men sprang to their feet to join in
the struggle round the lifts, and the remaining tobacco fell out of
Winston's cigarette.
Chapter 6
Winston was writing in his diary:
   It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a narrow
side-street near one of the big railway stations. She was standing near a
doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light. She
had a young face, painted very thick. It was really the paint that appealed
to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. Party
women never paint their faces. There was nobody else in the street, and no
telescreens. She said two dollars. I----
For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his eyes and pressed
his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept
recurring. He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of
filthy words at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall,
to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window--to do any
violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was
tormenting him.
Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. At any moment
the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible
symptom. He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks
back; a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five to
forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. They were a few metres
apart when the left side of the man's face was suddenly contorted by a sort
of spasm. It happened again just as they were passing one another: it was
only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but
obviously habitual. He remembered thinking at the time: That poor devil is
done for. And what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly
unconscious. The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. There
was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.
He drew his breath and went on writing:
   I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a
basement kitchen. There was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the
table, turned down very low. She----
His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit. Simultaneously
with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine, his wife.
Winston was married--had been married, at any rate: probably he still was
married, so far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to breathe
again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded
of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless
alluring, because no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be
imagined as doing so. Only the proles used scent. In his mind the smell
of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication.
When he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years
or thereabouts. Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, but
it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to
break. It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be
caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour camp:
not more, if you had committed no other offence. And it was easy enough,
provided that you could avoid being caught in the act. The poorer quarters
swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves. Some could even be
purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink.
Tacitly the Party was even inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outlet
for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed. Mere debauchery
did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless and only
involved the women of a submerged and despised class. The unforgivable
crime was promiscuity between Party members. But--though this was one
of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed
to--it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening.
The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming
loyalties which it might not be able to control. Its real, undeclared
purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much
as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. All
marriages between Party members had to be approved by a committee
appointed for the purpose, and--though the principle was never clearly
stated--permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave
the impression of being physically attracted to one another. The only
recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of
the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting
minor operation, like having an enema. This again was never put into plain
words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from
childhood onwards. There were even organizations such as the Junior
Anti-Sex League, which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes. All
children were to be begotten by artificial insemination (ARTSEM, it was
called in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. This, Winston
was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in
with the general ideology of the Party. The Party was trying to kill the
sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty
it. He did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should
be so. And as far as the women were concerned, the Party's efforts were
largely successful.
He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten--nearly eleven years
since they had parted. It was curious how seldom he thought of her. For
days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married.
They had only been together for about fifteen months. The Party did not
permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there
were no children.
Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid
movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called
noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing
behind it. Very early in her married life he had decided--though perhaps
it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people--that
she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had
ever encountered. She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan,
and there was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of
swallowing if the Party handed it out to her. 'The human sound-track' he
nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he could have endured living with her
if it had not been for just one thing--sex.
As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. To embrace her
was like embracing a jointed wooden image. And what was strange was that
even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she
was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidity
of her muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie there
with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but SUBMITTING. It was
extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then
he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should
remain celibate. But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this.
They must, she said, produce a child if they could. So the performance
continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not
impossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morning, as something
which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. She had
two names for it. One was 'making a baby', and the other was 'our duty to
the Party' (yes, she had actually used that phrase). Quite soon he grew to
have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round. But
luckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying,
and soon afterwards they parted.
Winston sighed inaudibly. He picked up his pen again and
wrote:
   She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of
preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up
her skirt. I----
He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of bugs
and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of defeat and
resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of
Katharine's white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party.
Why did it always have to be like this? Why could he not have a woman of
his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years? But a real
love affair was an almost unthinkable event. The women of the Party were
all alike. Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty. By
careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish that
was dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the Youth League, by
lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling
had been driven out of them. His reason told him that there must be
exceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable,
as the Party intended that they should be. And what he wanted, more even
than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it were
only once in his whole life. The sexual act, successfully performed, was
rebellion. Desire was thoughtcrime. Even to have awakened Katharine, if he
could have achieved it, would have been like a seduction, although she was
his wife.
But the rest of the story had got to be written down. He wrote:
   I turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light----
After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very
bright. For the first time he could see the woman properly. He had taken a
step towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror. He was painfully
conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here. It was perfectly
possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for that matter
they might be waiting outside the door at this moment. If he went away
without even doing what he had come here to do----!
It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed. What he had
suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was OLD. The paint was
plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack
like a cardboard mask. There were streaks of white in her hair; but the
truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open,
revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness. She had no teeth at all.
He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:
   When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years old
at least. But I went ahead and did it just the same.
He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. He had written it down
at last, but it made no difference. The therapy had not worked. The urge
to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever.
Chapter 7
'If there is hope,' wrote Winston, 'it lies in the proles.'
If there was hope, it MUST lie in the proles, because only there in those
swarming disregarded masses, 85 per cent of the population of Oceania,
could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could
not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had
no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if
the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was
inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than
twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the
voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, if only
they could somehow become conscious of their own strength. would have no
need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like
a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party to
pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to
do it? And yet----!
He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a
tremendous shout of hundreds of voices women's voices--had burst from a
side-street a little way ahead. It was a great formidable cry of anger
and despair, a deep, loud 'Oh-o-o-o-oh!' that went humming on like the
reverberation of a bell. His heart had leapt. It's started! he had thought.
A riot! The proles are breaking loose at last! When he had reached the spot
it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls
of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed
passengers on a sinking ship. But at this moment the general despair broke
down into a multitude of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the
stalls had been selling tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsy things,
but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get. Now the supply
had unexpectedly given out. The successful women, bumped and jostled by
the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of
others clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper of favouritism
and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve. There was a fresh
outburst of yells. Two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming
down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of
one another's hands. For a moment they were both tugging, and then the
handle came off. Winston watched them disgustedly. And yet, just for a
moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only
a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like that
about anything that mattered?
He wrote:
   Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they
have rebelled they cannot become conscious.
That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription from one of the
Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles
from bondage. Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by
the capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced
to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a
matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age
of six. But simultaneously, true to the Principles of doublethink, the
Party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in
subjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules. In
reality very little was known about the proles. It was not necessary to
know much. So long as they continued to work and breed, their other
activities were without importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned
loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of life
that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They were
born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed
through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married
at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part,
at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty
quarrels with neighbours, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling,
filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not
difficult. A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among them,
spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few
individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt
was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party. It was not
desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that
was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to
whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or
shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes
did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas,
they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils
invariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles did not even
have telescreens in their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them
very little. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a whole
world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and
racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles
themselves, it was of no importance. In all questions of morals they were
allowed to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism of the
Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce
was permitted. For that matter, even religious worship would have been
permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it.
They were beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: 'Proles and
animals are free.'
Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer. It
had begun itching again. The thing you invariably came back to was the
impossibility of knowing what life before the Revolution had really been
like. He took out of the drawer a copy of a children's history textbook
which he had borrowed from Mrs Parsons, and began copying a passage into
the diary:
   In the old days (it ran), before the glorious Revolution, London was
not the beautiful city that we know today. It was a dark, dirty, miserable
place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and
thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to
sleep under. Children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for
cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and
fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water. But in among all
this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses
that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look
after them. These rich men were called capitalists. They were fat, ugly
men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page.
You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a
frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was
called a top hat. This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else
was allowed to wear it. The capitalists owned everything in the world, and
everyone else was their slave. They owned all the land, all the houses,
all the factories, and all the money. If anyone disobeyed them they could
throw them into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to
death. When any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and
bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as 'Sir'. The chief of
all the capitalists was called the King, and----
But he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would be mention of the
bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in their ermine robes, the
pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the cat-o'-nine tails, the Lord Mayor's
Banquet, and the practice of kissing the Pope's toe. There was also
something called the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, which would probably not be
mentioned in a textbook for children. It was the law by which every
capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his
factories.
How could you tell how much of it was lies? It MIGHT be true that the
average human being was better off now than he had been before the
Revolution. The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your
own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were
intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different. It
struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not
its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its
listlessness. Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only
to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals
that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even for a Party
member, were neutral and non-political, a matter of slogging through dreary
jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging
a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the
Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering--a world of steel
and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons--a nation of
warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the
same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting,
triumphing, persecuting--three hundred million people all with the same
face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled
to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that
smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of
London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it
was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair,
fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe.
He reached down and scratched his ankle again. Day and night the
telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today
had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations--that they
lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger,
happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years
ago. Not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved. The Party claimed,
for example, that today 40 per cent of adult proles were literate: before
the Revolution, it was said, the number had only been 15 per cent. The
Party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per
thousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been 300--and so it went
on. It was like a single equation with two unknowns. It might very well be
that literally every word in the history books, even the things that one
accepted without question, was pure fantasy. For all he knew there might
never have been any such law as the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, or any such creature
as a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat.
Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten,
the lie became truth. Just once in his life he had possessed--AFTER the
event: that was what counted--concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of
falsification. He had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty
seconds. In 1973, it must have been--at any rate, it was at about the time
when he and Katharine had parted. But the really relevant date was seven
or eight years earlier.
The story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the great
purges in which the original leaders of the Revolution were wiped out
once and for all. By 1970 none of them was left, except Big Brother
himself. All the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and
counter-revolutionaries. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew
where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority
had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made
confession of their crimes. Among the last survivors were three men named
Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. It must have been in 1965 that these three
had been arrested. As often happened, they had vanished for a year or more,
so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had
suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way.
They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the
enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various
trusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother
which had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage
causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. After confessing to
these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the Party, and given
posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important. All three
had written long, abject articles in 'The Times', analysing the reasons
for their defection and promising to make amends.
Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them
in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He remembered the sort of terrified fascination
with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. They were men
far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great
figures left over from the heroic days of the Party. The glamour of the
underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. He had
the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing
blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that
of Big Brother. But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed
with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. No one who had
once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end.
They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.
There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It was not wise
even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. They were sitting
in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the
speciality of the cafe. Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance
had most impressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist,
whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and
during the Revolution. Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were
appearing in The Times. They were simply an imitation of his earlier
manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were a
rehashing of the ancient themes--slum tenements, starving children, street
battles, capitalists in top hats--even on the barricades the capitalists
still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless, hopeless effort to
get back into the past. He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy
grey hair, his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At one
time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging,
sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction. He seemed to be breaking
up before one's eyes, like a mountain crumbling.
It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not now remember how he
had come to be in the cafe at such a time. The place was almost empty. A
tinny music was trickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in their
corner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded, the waiter brought
fresh glasses of gin. There was a chessboard on the table beside them, with
the pieces set out but no game started. And then, for perhaps half a minute
in all, something happened to the telescreens. The tune that they were
playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too. There came into
it--but it was something hard to describe. It was a peculiar, cracked,
braying, jeering note: in his mind Winston called it a yellow note. And
then a voice from the telescreen was singing:
  Under the spreading chestnut tree
  I sold you and you sold me:
  There lie they, and here lie we
  Under the spreading chestnut tree.
The three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced again at Rutherford's
ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. And for the first
time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing
AT WHAT he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.
A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared that they had
engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release. At
their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with
a whole string of new ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded
in the Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years after
this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just
flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment
of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then
forgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance.
It was a half-page torn out of 'The Times' of about ten years earlier--the
top half of the page, so that it included the date--and it contained a
photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York. Prominent
in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There was
no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at the
bottom.
The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that
date they had been on Eurasian soil. They had flown from a secret airfield
in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with
members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important
military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston's memory because it chanced
to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless
other places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: the
confessions were lies.
Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that time Winston
had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had
actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this was
concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil
bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory.
It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could have
been published to the world and its significance made known.
He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what the photograph
was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper.
Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of
view of the telescreen.
He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as
to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your face
expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be
controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your
heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He let
what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the
fear that some accident--a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for
instance--would betray him. Then, without uncovering it again, he dropped
the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers.
Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.
That was ten--eleven years ago. Today, probably, he would have kept that
photograph. It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers
seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself,
as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party's hold
upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which
existed no longer HAD ONCE existed?
But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes,
the photograph might not even be evidence. Already, at the time when he
made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must
have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed
their country. Since then there had been other changes--two, three,
he could not remember how many. Very likely the confessions had been
rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer
had the smallest significance. The past not only changed, but changed
continuously. What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that
he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken.
The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the
ultimate motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote:
   I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.
He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was
a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. At one time it
had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun;
today, to believe that the past is unalterable. He might be ALONE in
holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being
a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also
be wrong.
He picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of
Big Brother which formed its frontispiece. The hypnotic eyes gazed into
his own. It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon
you--something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your
brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to
deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce that
two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable
that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their
position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very
existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The
heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that
they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right.
For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the
force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past
and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is
controllable what then?
But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord. The face
of O'Brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his
mind. He knew, with more certainty than before, that O'Brien was on his
side. He was writing the diary for O'Brien--TO O'Brien: it was like an
interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed
to a particular person and took its colour from that fact.
The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was
their final, most essential command. His heart sank as he thought of
the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party
intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he
would not be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he was in the
right! They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly, and the
true had got to be defended. Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solid
world exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet,
objects unsupported fall towards the earth's centre. With the feeling that
he was speaking to O'Brien, and also that he was setting forth an important
axiom, he wrote:
   Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is
granted, all else follows.
Chapter 8
From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting
coffee--real coffee, not Victory Coffee--came floating out into the street.
Winston paused involuntarily. For perhaps two seconds he was back in the
half-forgotten world of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cut
off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound.
He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcer
was throbbing. This was the second time in three weeks that he had missed
an evening at the Community Centre: a rash act, since you could be certain
that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked.
In principle a Party member had no spare time, and was never alone except
in bed. It was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping
he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do anything
that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself,
was always slightly dangerous. There was a word for it in Newspeak:
OWNLIFE, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. But this
evening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air had
tempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, and
suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre, the boring, exhausting
games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed
intolerable. On impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered
off into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, then north again,
losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which
direction he was going.
'If there is hope,' he had written in the diary, 'it lies in the proles.'
The words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and a
palpable absurdity. He was somewhere in the vague, brown-coloured slums
to the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He was
walking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with battered
doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow
curiously suggestive of ratholes. There were puddles of filthy water here
and there among the cobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and down
narrow alley-ways that branched off on either side, people swarmed in
astonishing numbers--girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths,
and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed you
what the girls would be like in ten years' time, and old bent creatures
shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played
in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers.
Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up.
Most of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a
sort of guarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-red forearms
folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway. Winston caught
scraps of conversation as he approached.
'"Yes," I says to 'er, "that's all very well," I says. "But if you'd of
been in my place you'd of done the same as what I done. It's easy to
criticize," I says, "but you ain't got the same problems as what I got."'
'Ah,' said the other, 'that's jest it. That's jest where it is.'
The strident voices stopped abruptly. The women studied him in hostile
silence as he went past. But it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind
of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar
animal. The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a
street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless
you had definite business there. The patrols might stop you if you happened
to run into them. 'May I see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here?
What time did you leave work? Is this your usual way home?'--and so on and
so forth. Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual
route: but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Police
heard about it.
Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were yells of warning
from all sides. People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. A
young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a
tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back
again, all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-like
black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston,
pointing excitedly to the sky.
'Steamer!' he yelled. 'Look out, guv'nor! Bang over'ead! Lay down quick!'
'Steamer' was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to
rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung himself on his face. The proles were
nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed
to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance
when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled faster
than sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roar
that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered
on to his back. When he stood up he found that he was covered with
fragments of glass from the nearest window.
He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up the
street. A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of
plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins. There
was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in
the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it he
saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from the bloody
stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.
He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned
down a side-street to the right. Within three or four minutes he was out
of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of
the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly
twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ('pubs',
they called them) were choked with customers. From their grimy swing doors,
endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust,
and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting house-front three men
were standing very close together, the middle one of them holding a
folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder.
Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces,
Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. It was
obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. He was a few
paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men
were in violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on the point
of blows.
'Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you no number ending
in seven ain't won for over fourteen months!'
'Yes, it 'as, then!'
'No, it 'as not! Back 'ome I got the 'ole lot of 'em for over two years
wrote down on a piece of paper. I takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock. An'
I tell you, no number ending in seven----'
'Yes, a seven 'AS won! I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number.
Four oh seven, it ended in. It were in February--second week in February.'
'February your grandmother! I got it all down in black and white. An' I
tell you, no number----'
'Oh, pack it in!' said the third man.
They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back when he had gone
thirty metres. They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.
The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public
event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that
there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal
if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their
folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was
concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of
intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole
tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and
lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery,
which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed
everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary.
Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being
non-existent persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication between
one part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.
But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that.
When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at
the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of
faith. The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling
that he had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main
thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din of
shouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight
of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stall-keepers
were selling tired-looking vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered
where he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down the next
turning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop where he had bought the
blank book which was now his diary. And in a small stationer's shop not
far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.
He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the opposite side of
the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted
over but in reality were merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but
active, with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn,
pushed open the swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching, it
occurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had
already been middle-aged when the Revolution happened. He and a few others
like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of
capitalism. In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideas
had been formed before the Revolution. The older generation had mostly
been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few
who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual
surrender. If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful
account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a
prole. Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into
his diary came back into Winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold
of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that
old man and question him. He would say to him: 'Tell me about your life
when you were a boy. What was it like in those days? Were things better
than they are now, or were they worse?'
Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended the
steps and crossed the narrow street. It was madness of course. As usual,
there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their
pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the
patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not
likely that they would believe him. He pushed open the door, and a hideous
cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. As he entered the din of
voices dropped to about half its volume. Behind his back he could feel
everyone eyeing his blue overalls. A game of darts which was going on at
the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty
seconds. The old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar, having
some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young
man with enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing round with glasses
in their hands, were watching the scene.
'I arst you civil enough, didn't I?' said the old man, straightening his
shoulders pugnaciously. 'You telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the
'ole bleeding boozer?'
'And what in hell's name IS a pint?' said the barman, leaning forward with
the tips of his fingers on the counter.
''Ark at 'im! Calls 'isself a barman and don't know what a pint is! Why,
a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and there's four quarts to the gallon.
'Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.'
'Never heard of 'em,' said the barman shortly. 'Litre and half
litre--that's all we serve. There's the glasses on the shelf in front
of you.'
'I likes a pint,' persisted the old man. 'You could 'a drawed me off a pint
easy enough. We didn't 'ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man.'
'When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,' said the
barman, with a glance at the other customers.
There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston's entry
seemed to disappear. The old man's white-stubbled face had flushed pink. He
turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught
him gently by the arm.
'May I offer you a drink?' he said.
'You're a gent,' said the other, straightening his shoulders again. He
appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls. 'Pint!' he added
aggressively to the barman. 'Pint of wallop.'
The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into thick glasses
which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. Beer was the only drink
you could get in prole pubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin,
though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of
darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun
talking about lottery tickets. Winston's presence was forgotten for a
moment. There was a deal table under the window where he and the old man
could talk without fear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but
at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure
of as soon as he came in.
''E could 'a drawed me off a pint,' grumbled the old man as he settled down
behind a glass. 'A 'alf litre ain't enough. It don't satisfy. And a 'ole
litre's too much. It starts my bladder running. Let alone the price.'
'You must have seen great changes since you were a young man,' said
Winston tentatively.
The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and
from the bar to the door of the Gents, as though it were in the bar-room
that he expected the changes to have occurred.
'The beer was better,' he said finally. 'And cheaper! When I was a young
man, mild beer--wallop we used to call it--was fourpence a pint. That was
before the war, of course.'
'Which war was that?' said Winston.
'It's all wars,' said the old man vaguely. He took up his glass, and his
shoulders straightened again. ''Ere's wishing you the very best of 'ealth!'
In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam's apple made a surprisingly rapid
up-and-down movement, and the beer vanished. Winston went to the bar and
came back with two more half-litres. The old man appeared to have forgotten
his prejudice against drinking a full litre.
'You are very much older than I am,' said Winston. 'You must have been a
grown man before I was born. You can remember what it was like in the old
days, before the Revolution. People of my age don't really know anything
about those times. We can only read about them in books, and what it says
in the books may not be true. I should like your opinion on that. The
history books say that life before the Revolution was completely different
from what it is now. There was the most terrible oppression, injustice,
poverty worse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, the great mass
of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. Half of them
hadn't even boots on their feet. They worked twelve hours a day, they left
school at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were
a very few people, only a few thousands--the capitalists, they were
called--who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was
to own. They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they
rode about in motor-cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne,
they wore top hats----'
The old man brightened suddenly.
'Top 'ats!' he said. 'Funny you should mention 'em. The same thing come
into my 'ead only yesterday, I dono why. I was jest thinking, I ain't seen
a top 'at in years. Gorn right out, they 'ave. The last time I wore one
was at my sister-in-law's funeral. And that was--well, I couldn't give you
the date, but it must'a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only 'ired
for the occasion, you understand.'
'It isn't very important about the top hats,' said Winston patiently.
'The point is, these capitalists--they and a few lawyers and priests and
so forth who lived on them--were the lords of the earth. Everything existed
for their benefit. You--the ordinary people, the workers--were their
slaves. They could do what they liked with you. They could ship you off to
Canada like cattle. They could sleep with your daughters if they chose.
They could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o'-nine
tails. You had to take your cap off when you passed them. Every capitalist
went about with a gang of lackeys who----'
The old man brightened again.
'Lackeys!' he said. 'Now there's a word I ain't 'eard since ever so long.
Lackeys! That reg'lar takes me back, that does. I recollect--oh, donkey's
years ago--I used to sometimes go to 'Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to
'ear the blokes making speeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews,
Indians--all sorts there was. And there was one bloke--well, I couldn't
give you 'is name, but a real powerful speaker 'e was. 'E didn't 'alf
give it 'em! "Lackeys!" 'e says, "lackeys of the bourgeoisie! Flunkies of
the ruling class!" Parasites--that was another of them. And 'yenas--'e
definitely called 'em 'yenas. Of course 'e was referring to the Labour
Party, you understand.'
Winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross-purposes.
'What I really wanted to know was this,' he said. 'Do you feel that you
have more freedom now than you had in those days? Are you treated more
like a human being? In the old days, the rich people, the people at the
top----'
'The 'Ouse of Lords,' put in the old man reminiscently.
'The House of Lords, if you like. What I am asking is, were these people
able to treat you as an inferior, simply because they were rich and you
were poor? Is it a fact, for instance, that you had to call them "Sir" and
take off your cap when you passed them?'
The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off about a quarter of his
beer before answering.
'Yes,' he said. 'They liked you to touch your cap to 'em. It showed
respect, like. I didn't agree with it, myself, but I done it often enough.
Had to, as you might say.'
'And was it usual--I'm only quoting what I've read in history books--was
it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement
into the gutter?'
'One of 'em pushed me once,' said the old man. 'I recollect it as if it
was yesterday. It was Boat Race night--terribly rowdy they used to get on
Boat Race night--and I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue.
Quite a gent, 'e was--dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat. 'E was kind
of zig-zagging across the pavement, and I bumps into 'im accidental-like.
'E says, "Why can't you look where you're going?" 'e says. I say, "Ju think
you've bought the bleeding pavement?" 'E says, "I'll twist your bloody 'ead
off if you get fresh with me." I says, "You're drunk. I'll give you in
charge in 'alf a minute," I says. An' if you'll believe me, 'e puts 'is
'and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the
wheels of a bus. Well, I was young in them days, and I was going to 'ave
fetched 'im one, only----'
A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old man's memory was
nothing but a rubbish-heap of details. One could question him all day
without getting any real information. The party histories might still be
true, after a fashion: they might even be completely true. He made a last
attempt.
'Perhaps I have not made myself clear,' he said. 'What I'm trying to say
is this. You have been alive a very long time; you lived half your life
before the Revolution. In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up.
Would you say from what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better
than it is now, or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to live
then or now?'
The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He finished up his
beer, more slowly than before. When he spoke it was with a tolerant
philosophical air, as though the beer had mellowed him.
'I know what you expect me to say,' he said. 'You expect me to say as I'd
sooner be young again. Most people'd say they'd sooner be young, if you
arst 'em. You got your 'ealth and strength when you're young. When you
get to my time of life you ain't never well. I suffer something wicked
from my feet, and my bladder's jest terrible. Six and seven times a night
it 'as me out of bed. On the other 'and, there's great advantages in being
a old man. You ain't got the same worries. No truck with women, and that's
a great thing. I ain't 'ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you'd
credit it. Nor wanted to, what's more.'
Winston sat back against the window-sill. It was no use going on. He was
about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled
rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The extra
half-litre was already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two
gazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out
into the street again. Within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the
huge and simple question, 'Was life better before the Revolution than it
is now?' would have ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effect
it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the
ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They
remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for
a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister's face, the
swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant
facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant,
which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed and
written records were falsified--when that happened, the claim of the Party
to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted,
because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard
against which it could be tested.
At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He halted and looked
up. He was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed
among dwelling-houses. Immediately above his head there hung three
discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. He
seemed to know the place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk-shop
where he had bought the diary.
A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a sufficiently rash act to
buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near the
place again. And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander,
his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. It was precisely
against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself
by opening the diary. At the same time he noticed that although it was
nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open. With the feeling that he
would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement, he
stepped through the doorway. If questioned, he could plausibly say that
he was trying to buy razor blades.
The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an
unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps sixty, frail and
bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick
spectacles. His hair was almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy and
still black. His spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact
that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague air
of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary man, or
perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as though faded, and his accent
less debased than that of the majority of proles.
'I recognized you on the pavement,' he said immediately. 'You're the
gentleman that bought the young lady's keepsake album. That was a beautiful
bit of paper, that was. Cream-laid, it used to be called. There's been no
paper like that made for--oh, I dare say fifty years.' He peered at Winston
over the top of his spectacles. 'Is there anything special I can do for
you? Or did you just want to look round?'
'I was passing,' said Winston vaguely. 'I just looked in. I don't want
anything in particular.'
'It's just as well,' said the other, 'because I don't suppose I could have
satisfied you.' He made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand.
'You see how it is; an empty shop, you might say. Between you and me, the
antique trade's just about finished. No demand any longer, and no stock
either. Furniture, china, glass it's all been broken up by degrees. And
of course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down. I haven't seen a brass
candlestick in years.'
The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but there
was almost nothing in it of the slightest value. The floorspace was very
restricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty
picture-frames. In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out
chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even
pretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish. Only on a
small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends--lacquered
snuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like--which looked as though they might
include something interesting. As Winston wandered towards the table his
eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in the
lamplight, and he picked it up.
It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making
almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in
both the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified
by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that
recalled a rose or a sea anemone.
'What is it?' said Winston, fascinated.
'That's coral, that is,' said the old man. 'It must have come from the
Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in the glass. That wasn't made
less than a hundred years ago. More, by the look of it.'
'It's a beautiful thing,' said Winston.
'It is a beautiful thing,' said the other appreciatively. 'But there's not
many that'd say so nowadays.' He coughed. 'Now, if it so happened that you
wanted to buy it, that'd cost you four dollars. I can remember when a thing
like that would have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was--well, I
can't work it out, but it was a lot of money. But who cares about genuine
antiques nowadays--even the few that's left?'
Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing
into his pocket. What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty
as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different
from the present one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass
that he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of its
apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have been
intended as a paperweight. It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately
it did not make much of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising
thing, for a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old, and for
that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The old man had
grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. Winston
realized that he would have accepted three or even two.
'There's another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,' he
said. 'There's not much in it. Just a few pieces. We'll do with a light if
we're going upstairs.'
He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the
steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did
not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of
chimney-pots. Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as
though the room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet on
the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly arm-chair
drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour
face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying
nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still
on it.
'We lived here till my wife died,' said the old man half apologetically.
'I'm selling the furniture off by little and little. Now that's a beautiful
mahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it.
But I dare say you'd find it a little bit cumbersome.'
He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and
in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. The thought
flitted through Winston's mind that it would probably be quite easy to
rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It
was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but
the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral
memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in
a room like this, in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your feet in
the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with
nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing
of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.
'There's no telescreen!' he could not help murmuring.
'Ah,' said the old man, 'I never had one of those things. Too expensive.
And I never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow. Now that's a nice
gateleg table in the corner there. Though of course you'd have to put new
hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps.'
There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and Winston had already
gravitated towards it. It contained nothing but rubbish. The hunting-down
and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the
prole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that there existed
anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960. The old
man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a
rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite
the bed.
'Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all----' he began
delicately.
Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel engraving of an
oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. There
was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was
what appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It
seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.
'The frame's fixed to the wall,' said the old man, 'but I could unscrew it
for you, I dare say.'
'I know that building,' said Winston finally. 'It's a ruin now. It's in
the middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice.'
'That's right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in--oh, many years
ago. It was a church at one time, St Clement Danes, its name was.' He
smiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly
ridiculous, and added: 'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!'
'What's that?' said Winston.
'Oh--"Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's." That was a rhyme
we had when I was a little boy. How it goes on I don't remember, but I do
know it ended up, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a
chopper to chop off your head." It was a kind of a dance. They held out
their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to "Here comes a
chopper to chop off your head" they brought their arms down and caught you.
It was just names of churches. All the London churches were in it--all the
principal ones, that is.'
Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. It was always
difficult to determine the age of a London building. Anything large and
impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically
claimed as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that was
obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle
Ages. The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any
value. One could not learn history from architecture any more than one
could learn it from books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the
names of streets--anything that might throw light upon the past had been
systematically altered.
'I never knew it had been a church,' he said.
'There's a lot of them left, really,' said the old man, 'though they've
been put to other uses. Now, how did that rhyme go? Ah! I've got it!
  "Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,
  You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's----"
there, now, that's as far as I can get. A farthing, that was a small copper
coin, looked something like a cent.'
'Where was St Martin's?' said Winston.
'St Martin's? That's still standing. It's in Victory Square, alongside the
picture gallery. A building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars
in front, and a big flight of steps.'
Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used for propaganda displays
of various kinds--scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses,
waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.
'St Martin's-in-the-Fields it used to be called,' supplemented the old man,
'though I don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.'
Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an even more
incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry
home, unless it were taken out of its frame. But he lingered for some
minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not
Weeks--as one might have gathered from the inscription over the
shop-front--but Charrington. Mr Charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged
sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years. Throughout that
time he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had never
quite got to the point of doing it. All the while that they were talking
the half-remembered rhyme kept running through Winston's head. Oranges and
lemons say the bells of St Clement's, You owe me three farthings, say
the bells of St Martin's! It was curious, but when you said it to yourself
you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost London
that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From one
ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet so
far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells
ringing.
He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as not
to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of
the door. He had already made up his mind that after a suitable
interval--a month, say--he would take the risk of visiting the shop again.
It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre.
The serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place,
after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the
shop could be trusted. However----!
Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would buy further scraps of
beautiful rubbish. He would buy the engraving of St Clement Danes, take
it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his
overalls. He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington's
memory. Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed
momentarily through his mind again. For perhaps five seconds exaltation
made him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much
as a preliminary glance through the window. He had even started humming
to an improvised tune
  Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,
  You owe me three farthings, say the----
Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water. A figure
in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten metres away. It was
the girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light
was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She looked
him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not
seen him.
For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move. Then he turned to the
right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was
going in the wrong direction. At any rate, one question was settled. There
was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She must have
followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she
should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure
backstreet, kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived.
It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was really an agent of the
Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly
mattered. It was enough that she was watching him. Probably she had seen
him go into the pub as well.
It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocket banged against
his thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw it
away. The worst thing was the pain in his belly. For a couple of minutes
he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon.
But there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then the
spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.
The street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood for several seconds
wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace his
steps. As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him
three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her.
He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then
smash her skull in with a cobblestone. The piece of glass in his pocket
would be heavy enough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately,
because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. He
could not run, he could not strike a blow. Besides, she was young and lusty
and would defend herself. He thought also of hurrying to the Community
Centre and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a
partial alibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadly
lassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get home quickly and
then sit down and be quiet.
It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat. The lights
would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty. He went into the
kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to
the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer.
But he did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy female voice
was squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring at the marbled cover of the
book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness.
It was at night that they came for you, always at night. The proper thing
was to kill yourself before they got you. Undoubtedly some people did so.
Many of the disappearances were actually suicides. But it needed desperate
courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and
certain poison, were completely unprocurable. He thought with a kind of
astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery
of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment
when a special effort is needed. He might have silenced the dark-haired
girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely because of the
extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. It struck him that
in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but
always against one's own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull
ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And it is the same,
he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. On the
battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that
you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until
it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or
screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or
cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.
He opened the diary. It was important to write something down. The woman
on the telescreen had started a new song. Her voice seemed to stick into
his brain like jagged splinters of glass. He tried to think of O'Brien,
for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking
of the things that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him
away. It would not matter if they killed you at once. To be killed was
what you expected. But before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet
everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to
be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the
crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hair.
Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? Why was
it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever
escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had
succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be
dead. Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded
in future time?
He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of
O'Brien. 'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' O'Brien
had said to him. He knew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place where
there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see,
but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. But with the
voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train
of thought further. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco
promptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to
spit out again. The face of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing that
of O'Brien. Just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of
his pocket and looked at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm,
protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?
Like a leaden knell the words came back at him:
  WAR IS PEACE
  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
PART TWO
Chapter 1
It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left the cubicle to go
to the lavatory.
A solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long,
brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl with dark hair. Four days had gone
past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk-shop.
As she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable
at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls. Probably
she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes
on which the plots of novels were 'roughed in'. It was a common accident
in the Fiction Department.
They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost
flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her. She must have
fallen right on the injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risen
to her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her
mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an
appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain.
A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart. In front of him was an enemy
who was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature,
in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. Already he had instinctively
started forward to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on
the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body.
'You're hurt?' he said.
'It's nothing. My arm. It'll be all right in a second.'
She spoke as though her heart were fluttering. She had certainly turned
very pale.
'You haven't broken anything?'
'No, I'm all right. It hurt for a moment, that's all.'
She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up. She had regained
some of her colour, and appeared very much better.
'It's nothing,' she repeated shortly. 'I only gave my wrist a bit of a
bang. Thanks, comrade!'
And with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going,
as briskly as though it had really been nothing. The whole incident could
not have taken as much as half a minute. Not to let one's feelings appear
in one's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct,
and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen
when the thing happened. Nevertheless it had been very difficult not to
betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was
helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. There was no
question that she had done it intentionally. It was something small and
flat. As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his
pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. It was a scrap of paper
folded into a square.
While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more fingering, to
get it unfolded. Obviously there must be a message of some kind written on
it. For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closets
and read it at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew.
There was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens
were watched continuously.
He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment of paper
casually among the other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles and
hitched the speakwrite towards him. 'Five minutes,' he told himself,
'five minutes at the very least!' His heart bumped in his breast with
frightening loudness. Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was
mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing
close attention.
Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind of political
meaning. So far as he could see there were two possibilities. One, much
the more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police,
just as he had feared. He did not know why the Thought Police should
choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had
their reasons. The thing that was written on the paper might be a threat, a
summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some description. But there
was another, wilder possibility that kept raising its head, though he
tried vainly to suppress it. This was, that the message did not come from
the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of underground organization.
Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps the girl was part of it!
No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very
instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not till a couple
of minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred to
him. And even now, though his intellect told him that the message probably
meant death--still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable
hope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty that he
kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the
speakwrite.
He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic
tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose,
sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the scrap of
paper on top of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a large
unformed handwriting:
I LOVE YOU.
For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating
thing into the memory hole. When he did so, although he knew very well the
danger of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it once
again, just to make sure that the words were really there.
For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. What was even
worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the
need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. He felt as though a
fire were burning in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled
canteen was torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little while during
the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile Parsons flopped
down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of
stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week.
He was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of Big
Brother's head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by
his daughter's troop of Spies. The irritating thing was that in the racket
of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was
constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just once
he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the
far end of the room. She appeared not to have seen him, and he did not
look in that direction again.
The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after lunch there arrived a
delicate, difficult piece of work which would take several hours and
necessitated putting everything else aside. It consisted in falsifying a
series of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast
discredit on a prominent member of the Inner Party, who was now under a
cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and for more
than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind
altogether. Then the memory of her face came back, and with it a raging,
intolerable desire to be alone. Until he could be alone it was impossible
to think this new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at the
Community Centre. He wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurried
off to the Centre, took part in the solemn foolery of a 'discussion group',
played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and
sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled 'Ingsoc in relation to
chess'. His soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulse
to shirk his evening at the Centre. At the sight of the words I LOVE YOU
the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor
risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was not till twenty-three hours, when he
was home and in bed--in the darkness, where you were safe even from the
telescreen so long as you kept silent--that he was able to think
continuously.
It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with
the girl and arrange a meeting. He did not consider any longer the
possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. He knew
that it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed
him the note. Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well
she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his
mind. Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with
a cobblestone, but that was of no importance. He thought of her naked,
youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined her a fool
like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her
belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might
lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him! What he feared
more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he
did not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical difficulty of
meeting was enormous. It was like trying to make a move at chess when you
were already mated. Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you.
Actually, all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to
him within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with time to think,
he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row of instruments
on a table.
Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not
be repeated. If she had worked in the Records Department it might have
been comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in
the building the Fiction Department lay, and he had no pretext for going
there. If he had known where she lived, and at what time she left work,
he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try
to follow her home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about
outside the Ministry, which was bound to be noticed. As for sending a
letter through the mails, it was out of the question. By a routine that
was not even secret, all letters were opened in transit. Actually, few
people ever wrote letters. For the messages that it was occasionally
necessary to send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases,
and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he did not
know the girl's name, let alone her address. Finally he decided that the
safest place was the canteen. If he could get her at a table by herself,
somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and
with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round--if these conditions
endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few
words.
For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On the next day she
did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the whistle having
already blown. Presumably she had been changed on to a later shift. They
passed each other without a glance. On the day after that she was in the
canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediately
under a telescreen. Then for three dreadful days she did not appear at
all. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable
sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, every
sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, an
agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image. He did
not touch the diary during those days. If there was any relief, it was in
his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a
stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. There
was no enquiry he could make. She might have been vaporized, she might
have committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end
of Oceania: worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her
mind and decided to avoid him.
The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling and she had a
band of sticking-plaster round her wrist. The relief of seeing her was
so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several
seconds. On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her.
When he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the
wall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was not very full.
The queue edged forward till Winston was almost at the counter, then was
held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he
had not received his tablet of saccharine. But the girl was still alone
when Winston secured his tray and began to make for her table. He walked
casually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond
her. She was perhaps three metres away from him. Another two seconds would
do it. Then a voice behind him called, 'Smith!' He pretended not to hear.
'Smith!' repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use. He turned round.
A blond-headed, silly-faced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew,
was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not
safe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not go and sit at
a table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down with
a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had a
hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it.
The girl's table filled up a few minutes later.
But she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps she would take
the hint. Next day he took care to arrive early. Surely enough, she was at
a table in about the same place, and again alone. The person immediately
ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man
with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away from
the counter with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straight
for the girl's table. His hopes sank again. There was a vacant place at a
table further away, but something in the little man's appearance suggested
that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the
emptiest table. With ice at his heart Winston followed. It was no use
unless he could get the girl alone. At this moment there was a tremendous
crash. The little man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying,
two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. He started
to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, whom he evidently
suspected of having tripped him up. But it was all right. Five seconds
later, with a thundering heart, Winston was sitting at the girl's table.
He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating.
It was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else came, but now
a terrible fear had taken possession of him. A week had gone by since
she had first approached him. She would have changed her mind, she must
have changed her mind! It was impossible that this affair should end
successfully; such things did not happen in real life. He might have
flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen
Ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round the room with
a tray, looking for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforth
was attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at his table if
he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act. Both
Winston and the girl were eating steadily. The stuff they were eating was
a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston
began speaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned the
watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few
necessary words in low expressionless voices.
'What time do you leave work?'
'Eighteen-thirty.'
'Where can we meet?'
'Victory Square, near the monument.'
'It's full of telescreens.'
'It doesn't matter if there's a crowd.'
'Any signal?'
'No. Don't come up to me until you see me among a lot of people. And don't
look at me. Just keep somewhere near me.'
'What time?'
'Nineteen hours.'
'All right.'
Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at another table. They did
not speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two people sitting on
opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one another. The
girl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while Winston stayed to
smoke a cigarette.
Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time. He wandered round
the base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which Big Brother's
statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the
Eurasian aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a few years
ago) in the Battle of Airstrip One. In the street in front of it there was
a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent Oliver
Cromwell. At five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared.
Again the terrible fear seized upon Winston. She was not coming, she had
changed her mind! He walked slowly up to the north side of the square and
got a sort of pale-coloured pleasure from identifying St Martin's Church,
whose bells, when it had bells, had chimed 'You owe me three farthings.'
Then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, reading or
pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column. It was not
safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated. There were
telescreens all round the pediment. But at this moment there was a din of
shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. Suddenly
everyone seemed to be running across the square. The girl nipped nimbly
round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush.
Winston followed. As he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that
a convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing.
Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square.
Winston, at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer
edge of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward
into the heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm's length of the girl,
but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous
woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of
flesh. Winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managed
to drive his shoulder between them. For a moment it felt as though his
entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips, then he
had broken through, sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were
shoulder to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.
A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed with sub-machine
guns standing upright in each corner, was passing slowly down the street.
In the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting,
jammed close together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides
of the trucks utterly incurious. Occasionally when a truck jolted there
was a clank-clank of metal: all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons.
Truck-load after truck-load of the sad faces passed. Winston knew they
were there but he saw them only intermittently. The girl's shoulder, and
her arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Her cheek was
almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. She had immediately taken
charge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. She began
speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely
moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling
of the trucks.
'Can you hear me?'
'Yes.'
'Can you get Sunday afternoon off?'
'Yes.'
'Then listen carefully. You'll have to remember this. Go to Paddington
Station----'
With a sort of military precision that astonished him, she outlined the
route that he was to follow. A half-hour railway journey; turn left outside
the station; two kilometres along the road; a gate with the top bar
missing; a path across a field; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes;
a dead tree with moss on it. It was as though she had a map inside her
head. 'Can you remember all that?' she murmured finally.
'Yes.'
'You turn left, then right, then left again. And the gate's got no top bar.'
'Yes. What time?'
'About fifteen. You may have to wait. I'll get there by another way. Are
you sure you remember everything?'
'Yes.'
'Then get away from me as quick as you can.'
She need not have told him that. But for the moment they could not
extricate themselves from the crowd. The trucks were still filing past,
the people still insatiably gaping. At the start there had been a few boos
and hisses, but it came only from the Party members among the crowd, and
had soon stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. Foreigners,
whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind of strange animal. One
literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as
prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them. Nor did
one know what became of them, apart from the few who were hanged as
war-criminals: the others simply vanished, presumably into forced-labour
camps. The round Mogol faces had given way to faces of a more European
type, dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheekbones eyes
looked into Winston's, sometimes with strange intensity, and flashed away
again. The convoy was drawing to an end. In the last truck he could see an
aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wrists
crossed in front of him, as though he were used to having them bound
together. It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part. But at the
last moment, while the crowd still hemmed them in, her hand felt for his
and gave it a fleeting squeeze.
It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time that
their hands were clasped together. He had time to learn every detail
of her hand. He explored the long fingers, the shapely nails, the
work-hardened palm with its row of callouses, the smooth flesh under the
wrist. Merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the
same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the
girl's eyes were. They were probably brown, but people with dark hair
sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head and look at her would have
been inconceivable folly. With hands locked together, invisible among
the press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead
of the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully
at Winston out of nests of hair.
Chapter 2
Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade,
stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted. Under the
trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells. The air
seemed to kiss one's skin. It was the second of May. From somewhere deeper
in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring-doves.
He was a bit early. There had been no difficulties about the journey, and
the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he
would normally have been. Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe
place. In general you could not assume that you were much safer in the
country than in London. There were no telescreens, of course, but there
was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might
be picked up and recognized; besides, it was not easy to make a journey
by yourself without attracting attention. For distances of less than
100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed, but
sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations, who
examined the papers of any Party member they found there and asked awkward
questions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the
station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not
being followed. The train was full of proles, in holiday mood because of
the summery weather. The wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was
filled to overflowing by a single enormous family, ranging from a toothless
great-grandmother to a month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoon
with 'in-laws' in the country, and, as they freely explained to Winston,
to get hold of a little black-market butter.
The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him
of, a mere cattle-track which plunged between the bushes. He had no watch,
but it could not be fifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfoot
that it was impossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and began
picking some partly to pass the time away, but also from a vague idea that
he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they
met. He had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly
scent when a sound at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of a
foot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was the best thing to do.
It might be the girl, or he might have been followed after all. To look
round was to show guilt. He picked another and another. A hand fell
lightly on his shoulder.
He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evidently as a warning
that he must keep silent, then parted the bushes and quickly led the way
along the narrow track into the wood. Obviously she had been that way
before, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston followed,
still clasping his bunch of flowers. His first feeling was relief, but as
he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him, with the scarlet
sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips, the
sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite
likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back
after all. The sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted
him. Already on the walk from the station the May sunshine had made him
feel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the sooty dust of
London in the pores of his skin. It occurred to him that till now she had
probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They came to the
fallen tree that she had spoken of. The girl hopped over and forced apart
the bushes, in which there did not seem to be an opening. When Winston
followed her, he found that they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassy
knoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely. The girl
stopped and turned.
'Here we are,' she said.
He was facing her at several paces' distance. As yet he did not dare move
nearer to her.
'I didn't want to say anything in the lane,' she went on, 'in case there's
a mike hidden there. I don't suppose there is, but there could be. There's
always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice. We're all
right here.'
He still had not the courage to approach her. 'We're all right here?'
he repeated stupidly.
'Yes. Look at the trees.' They were small ashes, which at some time had
been cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles, none of
them thicker than one's wrist. 'There's nothing big enough to hide a mike
in. Besides, I've been here before.'
They were only making conversation. He had managed to move closer to her
now. She stood before him very upright, with a smile on her face that
looked faintly ironical, as though she were wondering why he was so slow
to act. The bluebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed to have
fallen of their own accord. He took her hand.
'Would you believe,' he said, 'that till this moment I didn't know what
colour your eyes were?' They were brown, he noted, a rather light shade of
brown, with dark lashes. 'Now that you've seen what I'm really like,
can you still bear to look at me?'
'Yes, easily.'
'I'm thirty-nine years old. I've got a wife that I can't get rid of. I've
got varicose veins. I've got five false teeth.'
'I couldn't care less,' said the girl.
The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was in his arms.
At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity. The youthful
body was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against his
face, and yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the
wide red mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck, she was calling
him darling, precious one, loved one. He had pulled her down on to the
ground, she was utterly unresisting, he could do what he liked with her.
But the truth was that he had no physical sensation, except that of mere
contact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He was glad that this was
happening, but he had no physical desire. It was too soon, her youth and
prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living without
women--he did not know the reason. The girl picked herself up and pulled a
bluebell out of her hair. She sat against him, putting her arm round his
waist.
'Never mind, dear. There's no hurry. We've got the whole afternoon. Isn't
this a splendid hide-out? I found it when I got lost once on a community
hike. If anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away.'
'What is your name?' said Winston.
'Julia. I know yours. It's Winston--Winston Smith.'
'How did you find that out?'
'I expect I'm better at finding things out than you are, dear. Tell me,
what did you think of me before that day I gave you the note?'
He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. It was even a sort of
love-offering to start off by telling the worst.
'I hated the sight of you,' he said. 'I wanted to rape you and then murder
you afterwards. Two weeks ago I thought seriously of smashing your head in
with a cobblestone. If you really want to know, I imagined that you had
something to do with the Thought Police.'
The girl laughed delightedly, evidently taking this as a
tribute to the excellence of her disguise.
'Not the Thought Police! You didn't honestly think that?'
'Well, perhaps not exactly that. But from your general appearance--merely
because you're young and fresh and healthy, you understand--I thought that
probably----'
'You thought I was a good Party member. Pure in word and deed. Banners,
processions, slogans, games, community hikes all that stuff. And you
thought that if I had a quarter of a chance I'd denounce you as a
thought-criminal and get you killed off?'
'Yes, something of that kind. A great many young girls are like that,
you know.'
'It's this bloody thing that does it,' she said, ripping off the scarlet
sash of the Junior Anti-Sex League and flinging it on to a bough. Then,
as though touching her waist had reminded her of something, she felt in
the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. She
broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to Winston. Even before he had
taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate. It was
dark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver paper. Chocolate normally was
dull-brown crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it,
like the smoke of a rubbish fire. But at some time or another he had tasted
chocolate like the piece she had given him. The first whiff of its scent
had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down, but which was
powerful and troubling.
'Where did you get this stuff?' he said.
'Black market,' she said indifferently. 'Actually I am that sort of girl,
to look at. I'm good at games. I was a troop-leader in the Spies. I do
voluntary work three evenings a week for the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours
and hours I've spent pasting their bloody rot all over London. I always
carry one end of a banner in the processions. I always look cheerful and
I never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd, that's what I say.
It's the only way to be safe.'
The first fragment of chocolate had melted on Winston's tongue. The taste
was delightful. But there was still that memory moving round the edges of
his consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to definite
shape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye. He pushed it
away from him, aware only that it was the memory of some action which he
would have liked to undo but could not.
'You are very young,' he said. 'You are ten or fifteen years younger than
I am. What could you see to attract you in a man like me?'
'It was something in your face. I thought I'd take a chance. I'm good at
spotting people who don't belong. As soon as I saw you I knew you were
against THEM.'
THEM, it appeared, meant the Party, and above all the Inner Party, about
whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made Winston feel uneasy,
although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere.
A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language.
Party members were supposed not to swear, and Winston himself very seldom
did swear, aloud, at any rate. Julia, however, seemed unable to mention
the Party, and especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of words
that you saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways. He did not dislike it. It
was merely one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all its ways,
and somehow it seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that
smells bad hay. They had left the clearing and were wandering again
through the chequered shade, with their arms round each other's waists
whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast. He noticed how much
softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. They did not
speak above a whisper. Outside the clearing, Julia said, it was better to
go quietly. Presently they had reached the edge of the little wood. She
stopped him.
'Don't go out into the open. There might be someone watching. We're all
right if we keep behind the boughs.'
They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. The sunlight, filtering
through innumerable leaves, was still hot on their faces. Winston looked
out into the field beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock of
recognition. He knew it by sight. An old, close-bitten pasture, with a
footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged
hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just
perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly in dense
masses like women's hair. Surely somewhere nearby, but out of sight,
there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming?
'Isn't there a stream somewhere near here?' he whispered.
'That's right, there is a stream. It's at the edge of the next field,
actually. There are fish in it, great big ones. You can watch them lying
in the pools under the willow trees, waving their tails.'
'It's the Golden Country--almost,' he murmured.
'The Golden Country?'
'It's nothing, really. A landscape I've seen sometimes in a dream.'
'Look!' whispered Julia.
A thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away, almost at the level
of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen them. It was in the sun, they in
the shade. It spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place
again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance
to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the
afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung
together, fascinated. The music went on and on, minute after minute, with
astonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though the
bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped
for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its
speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a sort
of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate,
no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood
and pour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether after all there
was a microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken only in
low whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would
pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small,
beetle-like man was listening intently--listening to that. But by degrees
the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as
though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got
mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. He stopped
thinking and merely felt. The girl's waist in the bend of his arm was soft
and warm. He pulled her round so that they were breast to breast; her body
seemed to melt into his. Wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as
water. Their mouths clung together; it was quite different from the hard
kisses they had exchanged earlier. When they moved their faces apart again
both of them sighed deeply. The bird took fright and fled with a clatter
of wings.
Winston put his lips against her ear. 'NOW,' he whispered.
'Not here,' she whispered back. 'Come back to the hide-out. It's safer.'
Quickly, with an occasional crackle of twigs, they threaded their way back
to the clearing. When they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned
and faced him. They were both breathing fast, but the smile had reappeared
round the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him for an instant,
then felt at the zipper of her overalls. And, yes! it was almost as in his
dream. Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes
off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent
gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. Her body
gleamed white in the sun. But for a moment he did not look at her body;
his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint, bold smile.
He knelt down before her and took her hands in his.
'Have you done this before?'
'Of course. Hundreds of times--well, scores of times, anyway.'
'With Party members?'
'Yes, always with Party members.'
'With members of the Inner Party?'
'Not with those swine, no. But there's plenty that WOULD if they got half
a chance. They're not so holy as they make out.'
His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he wished it had been
hundreds--thousands. Anything that hinted at corruption always filled him
with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface,
its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing
iniquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or
syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Anything to rot, to weaken, to
undermine! He pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face.
'Listen. The more men you've had, the more I love you. Do you understand
that?'
'Yes, perfectly.'
'I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don't want any virtue to exist anywhere.
I want everyone to be corrupt to the bones.'
'Well then, I ought to suit you, dear. I'm corrupt to the bones.'
'You like doing this? I don't mean simply me: I mean the thing in itself?'
'I adore it.'
That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely the love of one
person but the animal instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire: that
was the force that would tear the Party to pieces. He pressed her down
upon the grass, among the fallen bluebells. This time there was no
difficulty. Presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to
normal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. The
sun seemed to have grown hotter. They were both sleepy. He reached out for
the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her. Almost immediately
they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour.
Winston woke first. He sat up and watched the freckled face, still
peacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of her hand. Except for her mouth,
you could not call her beautiful. There was a line or two round the eyes,
if you looked closely. The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and
soft. It occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where
she lived.
The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in him a pitying,
protecting feeling. But the mindless tenderness that he had felt under
the hazel tree, while the thrush was singing, had not quite come back.
He pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank. In the
old days, he thought, a man looked at a girl's body and saw that it was
desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could not have pure
love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because everything was
mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax
a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.
Chapter 3
'We can come here once again,' said Julia. 'It's generally safe to use any
hide-out twice. But not for another month or two, of course.'
As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. She became alert and
business-like, put her clothes on, knotted the scarlet sash about her
waist, and began arranging the details of the journey home. It seemed
natural to leave this to her. She obviously had a practical cunning which
Winston lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the
countryside round London, stored away from innumerable community hikes.
The route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had
come, and brought him out at a different railway station. 'Never go home
the same way as you went out,' she said, as though enunciating an important
general principle. She would leave first, and Winston was to wait half an
hour before following her.
She had named a place where they could meet after work, four evenings
hence. It was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where there was an
open market which was generally crowded and noisy. She would be hanging
about among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or
sewing-thread. If she judged that the coast was clear she would blow
her nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk past her without
recognition. But with luck, in the middle of the crowd, it would be
safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting.
'And now I must go,' she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions.
'I'm due back at nineteen-thirty. I've got to put in two hours for the
Junior Anti-Sex League, handing out leaflets, or something. Isn't it
bloody? Give me a brush-down, would you? Have I got any twigs in my hair?
Are you sure? Then good-bye, my love, good-bye!'
She flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost violently, and a moment
later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood
with very little noise. Even now he had not found out her surname or her
address. However, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable that
they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication.
As it happened, they never went back to the clearing in the wood. During
the month of May there was only one further occasion on which they actually
succeeded in making love. That was in another hiding-place known to Julia,
the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of country
where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. It was a good
hiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was very
dangerous. For the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different
place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. In the
street it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As they drifted
down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at one
another, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flicked
on and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence
by the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then
taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly
cut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without
introduction on the following day. Julia appeared to be quite used to this
kind of conversation, which she called 'talking by instalments'. She was
also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once in
almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. They
were passing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speak when
they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the
earth heaved, and the air darkened, and Winston found himself lying on his
side, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at
hand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a few centimetres from his
own, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were white. She was
dead! He clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live
warm face. But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his
lips. Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster.
There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to
walk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come round
the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead. Even if it had been
less dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet.
Winston's working week was sixty hours, Julia's was even longer, and
their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not
often coincide. Julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free.
She spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and
demonstrations, distributing literature for the junior Anti-Sex League,
preparing banners for Hate Week, making collections for the savings
campaign, and such-like activities. It paid, she said, it was camouflage.
If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. She even induced
Winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for
the part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Party
members. So, one evening every week, Winston spent four hours of paralysing
boredom, screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts
of bomb fuses, in a draughty, ill-lit workshop where the knocking of
hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens.
When they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary
conversation were filled up. It was a blazing afternoon. The air in the
little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smelt
overpoweringly of pigeon dung. They sat talking for hours on the dusty,
twig-littered floor, one or other of them getting up from time to time to
cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming.
Julia was twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel with thirty other
girls ('Always in the stink of women! How I hate women!' she said
parenthetically), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the novel-writing
machines in the Fiction Department. She enjoyed her work, which consisted
chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor.
She was 'not clever', but was fond of using her hands and felt at home
with machinery. She could describe the whole process of composing a novel,
from the general directive issued by the Planning Committee down to the
final touching-up by the Rewrite Squad. But she was not interested in the
finished product. She 'didn't much care for reading,' she said. Books were
just a commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces.
She had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only
person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the
Revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight. At
school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics
trophy two years running. She had been a troop-leader in the Spies and a
branch secretary in the Youth League before joining the Junior Anti-Sex
League. She had always borne an excellent character. She had even (an
infallible mark of good reputation) been picked out to work in Pornosec,
the sub-section of the Fiction Department which turned out cheap
pornography for distribution among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck House
by the people who worked in it, she remarked. There she had remained for
a year, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like
'Spanking Stories' or 'One Night in a Girls' School', to be bought
furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they
were buying something illegal.
'What are these books like?' said Winston curiously.
'Oh, ghastly rubbish. They're boring, really. They only have six plots,
but they swap them round a bit. Of course I was only on the kaleidoscopes.
I was never in the Rewrite Squad. I'm not literary, dear--not even enough
for that.'
He learned with astonishment that all the workers in Pornosec, except the
heads of the departments, were girls. The theory was that men, whose sex
instincts were less controllable than those of women, were in greater
danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled.
'They don't even like having married women there,' she added. Girls are
always supposed to be so pure. Here's one who isn't, anyway.
She had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen, with a Party member
of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest. 'And a good job too,'
said Julia, 'otherwise they'd have had my name out of him when he
confessed.' Since then there had been various others. Life as she saw it
was quite simple. You wanted a good time; 'they', meaning the Party,
wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could. She
seemed to think it just as natural that 'they' should want to rob you of
your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught. She hated
the Party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no general
criticism of it. Except where it touched upon her own life she had no
interest in Party doctrine. He noticed that she never used Newspeak words
except the ones that had passed into everyday use. She had never heard of
the Brotherhood, and refused to believe in its existence. Any kind of
organized revolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure,
struck her as stupid. The clever thing was to break the rules and stay
alive all the same. He wondered vaguely how many others like her there
might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of
the Revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting the Party as something
unalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simply
evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog.
They did not discuss the possibility of getting married. It was too remote
to be worth thinking about. No imaginable committee would ever sanction
such a marriage even if Katharine, Winston's wife, could somehow have been
got rid of. It was hopeless even as a daydream.
'What was she like, your wife?' said Julia.
'She was--do you know the Newspeak word GOODTHINKFUL? Meaning naturally
orthodox, incapable of thinking a bad thought?'
'No, I didn't know the word, but I know the kind of person, right enough.'
He began telling her the story of his married life, but curiously enough
she appeared to know the essential parts of it already. She described
to him, almost as though she had seen or felt it, the stiffening of
Katharine's body as soon as he touched her, the way in which she still
seemed to be pushing him from her with all her strength, even when her
arms were clasped tightly round him. With Julia he felt no difficulty in
talking about such things: Katharine, in any case, had long ceased to be
a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one.
'I could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing,' he said. He told
her about the frigid little ceremony that Katharine had forced him to go
through on the same night every week. 'She hated it, but nothing would
make her stop doing it. She used to call it--but you'll never guess.'
'Our duty to the Party,' said Julia promptly.
'How did you know that?'
'I've been at school too, dear. Sex talks once a month for the
over-sixteens. And in the Youth Movement. They rub it into you for years.
I dare say it works in a lot of cases. But of course you can never tell;
people are such hypocrites.'
She began to enlarge upon the subject. With Julia, everything came back
to her own sexuality. As soon as this was touched upon in any way she was
capable of great acuteness. Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner
meaning of the Party's sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sex
instinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party's control
and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was more
important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable
because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The way
she put it was:
'When you make love you're using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy
and don't give a damn for anything. They can't bear you to feel like that.
They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marching
up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. If
you're happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother
and the Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of
their bloody rot?'
That was very true, he thought. There was a direct intimate connexion
between chastity and political orthodoxy. For how could the fear, the
hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be
kept at the right pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct
and using it as a driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous to the
Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They had played a similar
trick with the instinct of parenthood. The family could not actually be
abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of their
children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand,
were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them
and report their deviations. The family had become in effect an extension
of the Thought Police. It was a device by means of which everyone could be
surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.
Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharine would unquestionably
have denounced him to the Thought Police if she had not happened to be too
stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions. But what really recalled
her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, which
had brought the sweat out on his forehead. He began telling Julia of
something that had happened, or rather had failed to happen, on another
sweltering summer afternoon, eleven years ago.
It was three or four months after they were married. They had lost their
way on a community hike somewhere in Kent. They had only lagged behind
the others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and
presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk
quarry. It was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres, with boulders at the
bottom. There was nobody of whom they could ask the way. As soon as she
realized that they were lost Katharine became very uneasy. To be away
from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of
wrong-doing. She wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start
searching in the other direction. But at this moment Winston noticed some
tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them.
One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick-red, apparently growing on
the same root. He had never seen anything of the kind before, and he called
to Katharine to come and look at it.
'Look, Katharine! Look at those flowers. That clump down near the bottom.
Do you see they're two different colours?'
She had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully come back for
a moment. She even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he was
pointing. He was standing a little behind her, and he put his hand on
her waist to steady her. At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how
completely alone they were. There was not a human creature anywhere, not a
leaf stirring, not even a bird awake. In a place like this the danger that
there would be a hidden microphone was very small, and even if there was a
microphone it would only pick up sounds. It was the hottest sleepiest hour
of the afternoon. The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled his
face. And the thought struck him...
'Why didn't you give her a good shove?' said Julia. 'I would have.'
'Yes, dear, you would have. I would, if I'd been the same person then as
I am now. Or perhaps I would--I'm not certain.'
'Are you sorry you didn't?'
'Yes. On the whole I'm sorry I didn't.'
They were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. He pulled her closer
against him. Her head rested on his shoulder, the pleasant smell of her
hair conquering the pigeon dung. She was very young, he thought, she
still expected something from life, she did not understand that to push
an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing.
'Actually it would have made no difference,' he said.
'Then why are you sorry you didn't do it?'
'Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In this game that we're
playing, we can't win. Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds,
that's all.'
He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. She always contradicted
him when he said anything of this kind. She would not accept it as a law
of nature that the individual is always defeated. In a way she realized
that she herself was doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police would
catch her and kill her, but with another part of her mind she believed
that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could
live as you chose. All you needed was luck and cunning and boldness. She
did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the
only victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead, that from
the moment of declaring war on the Party it was better to think of yourself
as a corpse.
'We are the dead,' he said.
'We're not dead yet,' said Julia prosaically.
'Not physically. Six months, a year--five years, conceivably. I am afraid
of death. You are young, so presumably you're more afraid of it than I am.
Obviously we shall put it off as long as we can. But it makes very little
difference. So long as human beings stay human, death and life are the
same thing.'
'Oh, rubbish! Which would you sooner sleep with, me or a skeleton? Don't
you enjoy being alive? Don't you like feeling: This is me, this is my hand,
this is my leg, I'm real, I'm solid, I'm alive! Don't you like THIS?'
She twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him. He could feel
her breasts, ripe yet firm, through her overalls. Her body seemed to be
pouring some of its youth and vigour into his.
'Yes, I like that,' he said.
'Then stop talking about dying. And now listen, dear, we've got to fix
up about the next time we meet. We may as well go back to the place in
the wood. We've given it a good long rest. But you must get there by a
different way this time. I've got it all planned out. You take the
train--but look, I'll draw it out for you.'
And in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust,
and with a twig from a pigeon's nest began drawing a map on the floor.
Chapter 4
Winston looked round the shabby little room above Mr Charrington's shop.
Beside the window the enormous bed was made up, with ragged blankets and
a coverless bolster. The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was
ticking away on the mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gateleg table, the
glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out
of the half-darkness.
In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups,
provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the burner and set a pan of water
to boil. He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and some
saccharine tablets. The clock's hands said seventeen-twenty: it was
nineteen-twenty really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty.
Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, suicidal folly.
Of all the crimes that a Party member could commit, this one was the least
possible to conceal. Actually the idea had first floated into his head in
the form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface
of the gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had made no
difficulty about letting the room. He was obviously glad of the few dollars
that it would bring him. Nor did he seem shocked or become offensively
knowing when it was made clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose
of a love-affair. Instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in
generalities, with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he
had become partly invisible. Privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing.
Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally. And when
they had such a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew
of it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even, seeming almost to fade
out of existence as he did so, added that there were two entries to the
house, one of them through the back yard, which gave on an alley.
Under the window somebody was singing. Winston peeped out, secure in the
protection of the muslin curtain. The June sun was still high in the sky,
and in the sun-filled court below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman
pillar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her
middle, was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line,
pegging out a series of square white things which Winston recognized as
babies' diapers. Whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she
was singing in a powerful contralto:
  It was only an 'opeless fancy.
  It passed like an Ipril dye,
  But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred!
  They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!
The tune had been haunting London for weeks past. It was one of countless
similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a sub-section of
the Music Department. The words of these songs were composed without any
human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator.
But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an
almost pleasant sound. He could hear the woman singing and the scrape of
her shoes on the flagstones, and the cries of the children in the street,
and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet the
room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of a telescreen.
Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceivable that they could
frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught. But
the temptation of having a hiding-place that was truly their own, indoors
and near at hand, had been too much for both of them. For some time
after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange
meetings. Working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of
Hate Week. It was more than a month distant, but the enormous, complex
preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody.
Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day.
They had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. On the evening
beforehand they met briefly in the street. As usual, Winston hardly looked
at Julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd, but from the
short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual.
'It's all off,' she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak.
'Tomorrow, I mean.'
'What?'
'Tomorrow afternoon. I can't come.'
'Why not?'
'Oh, the usual reason. It's started early this time.'
For a moment he was violently angry. During the month that he had known
her the nature of his desire for her had changed. At the beginning there
had been little true sensuality in it. Their first love-making had been
simply an act of the will. But after the second time it was different. The
smell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed
to have got inside him, or into the air all round him. She had become a
physical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that he
had a right to. When she said that she could not come, he had the feeling
that she was cheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed
them together and their hands accidentally met. She gave the tips of his
fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection. It
struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment
must be a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had
not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He wished that they
were a married couple of ten years' standing. He wished that he were
walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly
and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the
household. He wished above all that they had some place where they could
be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time
they met. It was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the
following day, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington's room had occurred
to him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected
readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they were
intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the
edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.
It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's
consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as
surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps
postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilful
act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.
At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia burst into the
room. She was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas, such as he had
sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry. He started forward
to take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly,
partly because she was still holding the tool-bag.
'Half a second,' she said. 'Just let me show you what I've brought. Did
you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee? I thought you would. You
can chuck it away again, because we shan't be needing it. Look here.'
She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out some spanners
and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it. Underneath were a number
of neat paper packets. The first packet that she passed to Winston had a
strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind of
heavy, sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touched it.
'It isn't sugar?' he said.
'Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here's a loaf of bread--proper
white bread, not our bloody stuff--and a little pot of jam. And here's a
tin of milk--but look! This is the one I'm really proud of. I had to wrap
a bit of sacking round it, because----'
But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up. The smell was
already filling the room, a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation
from his early childhood, but which one did occasionally meet with even
now, blowing down a passage-way before a door slammed, or diffusing itself
mysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant and then lost
again.
'It's coffee,' he murmured, 'real coffee.'
'It's Inner Party coffee. There's a whole kilo here,' she said.
'How did you manage to get hold of all these things?'
'It's all Inner Party stuff. There's nothing those swine don't have,
nothing. But of course waiters and servants and people pinch things,
and--look, I got a little packet of tea as well.'
Winston had squatted down beside her. He tore open a corner of the packet.
'It's real tea. Not blackberry leaves.'
'There's been a lot of tea about lately. They've captured India, or
something,' she said vaguely. 'But listen, dear. I want you to turn your
back on me for three minutes. Go and sit on the other side of the bed.
Don't go too near the window. And don't turn round till I tell you.'
Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain. Down in the yard
the red-armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and
the line. She took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep
feeling:
  They sye that time 'eals all things,
  They sye you can always forget;
  But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years
  They twist my 'eart-strings yet!
She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed. Her voice floated
upward with the sweet summer air, very tuneful, charged with a sort of
happy melancholy. One had the feeling that she would have been perfectly
content, if the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes
inexhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging out diapers
and singing rubbish. It struck him as a curious fact that he had never
heard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously. It would even
have seemed slightly unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to
oneself. Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation
level that they had anything to sing about.
'You can turn round now,' said Julia.
He turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her. What he
had actually expected was to see her naked. But she was not naked. The
transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that. She
had painted her face.
She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought
herself a complete set of make-up materials. Her lips were deeply reddened,
her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something
under the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully done, but
Winston's standards in such matters were not high. He had never before
seen or imagined a woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face. The
improvement in her appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colour
in the right places she had become not only very much prettier, but, above
all, far more feminine. Her short hair and boyish overalls merely added
to the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets
flooded his nostrils. He remembered the half-darkness of a basement
kitchen, and a woman's cavernous mouth. It was the very same scent that
she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.
'Scent too!' he said.
'Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I'm going to do next? I'm
going to get hold of a real woman's frock from somewhere and wear it
instead of these bloody trousers. I'll wear silk stockings and high-heeled
shoes! In this room I'm going to be a woman, not a Party comrade.'
They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed. It
was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence.
Until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with
the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch
over his ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on was
threadbare and smooth, and the size and springiness of the bed astonished
both of them. 'It's sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?' said Julia.
One never saw a double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles.
Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Julia had never been
in one before, so far as she could remember.
Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Winston woke up the
hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. He did not stir, because
Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. Most of her
make-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light
stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow ray
from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the
fireplace, where the water in the pan was boiling fast. Down in the yard
the woman had stopped singing, but the faint shouts of children floated in
from the street. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had
been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summer
evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose,
talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply
lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely there could
never have been a time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up, rubbed
her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove.
'Half that water's boiled away,' she said. 'I'll get up and make some
coffee in another moment. We've got an hour. What time do they cut the
lights off at your flats?'
'Twenty-three thirty.'
'It's twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to get in earlier than that,
because--Hi! Get out, you filthy brute!'
She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a shoe from the floor,
and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm, exactly
as he had seen her fling the dictionary at Goldstein, that morning during
the Two Minutes Hate.
'What was it?' he said in surprise.
'A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting. There's a
hole down there. I gave him a good fright, anyway.'
'Rats!' murmured Winston. 'In this room!'
'They're all over the place,' said Julia indifferently as she lay down
again. 'We've even got them in the kitchen at the hostel. Some parts of
London are swarming with them. Did you know they attack children? Yes,
they do. In some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for
two minutes. It's the great huge brown ones that do it. And the nasty
thing is that the brutes always----'
'DON'T GO ON!' said Winston, with his eyes tightly shut.
'Dearest! You've gone quite pale. What's the matter? Do they make you feel
sick?'
'Of all horrors in the world--a rat!'
She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him, as though
to reassure him with the warmth of her body. He did not reopen his eyes
immediately. For several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a
nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. It was
always very much the same. He was standing in front of a wall of darkness,
and on the other side of it there was something unendurable, something too
dreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of
self-deception, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of
darkness. With a deadly effort, like wrenching a piece out of his own
brain, he could even have dragged the thing into the open. He always woke
up without discovering what it was: but somehow it was connected with what
Julia had been saying when he cut her short.
'I'm sorry,' he said, 'it's nothing. I don't like rats, that's all.'
'Don't worry, dear, we're not going to have the filthy brutes in here.
I'll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go. And next time we
come here I'll bring some plaster and bung it up properly.'
Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. Feeling slightly
ashamed of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. Julia got out of bed,
pulled on her overalls, and made the coffee. The smell that rose from the
saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest
anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive. What was even
better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by
the sugar, a thing Winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine.
With one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other,
Julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the bookcase,
pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping herself
down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable, and examining
the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. She brought
the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better
light. He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft,
rainwatery appearance of the glass.
'What is it, do you think?' said Julia.
'I don't think it's anything--I mean, I don't think it was ever put to any
use. That's what I like about it. It's a little chunk of history that
they've forgotten to alter. It's a message from a hundred years ago, if
one knew how to read it.'
'And that picture over there'--she nodded at the engraving on the opposite
wall--'would that be a hundred years old?'
'More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can't tell. It's impossible to discover
the age of anything nowadays.'
She went over to look at it. 'Here's where that brute stuck his nose out,'
she said, kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture. 'What is
this place? I've seen it before somewhere.'
'It's a church, or at least it used to be. St Clement Danes its name was.'
The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington had taught him came back into
his head, and he added half-nostalgically: "Oranges and lemons, say the
bells of St Clement's!"
To his astonishment she capped the line:
  'You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,
  When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey----'
'I can't remember how it goes on after that. But anyway I remember it ends
up, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop
off your head!"'
It was like the two halves of a countersign. But there must be another
line after 'the bells of Old Bailey'. Perhaps it could be dug out of
Mr Charrington's memory, if he were suitably prompted.
'Who taught you that?' he said.
'My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a little girl. He was
vaporized when I was eight--at any rate, he disappeared. I wonder what a
lemon was,' she added inconsequently. 'I've seen oranges. They're a kind
of round yellow fruit with a thick skin.'
'I can remember lemons,' said Winston. 'They were quite common in the
fifties. They were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell
them.'
'I bet that picture's got bugs behind it,' said Julia. 'I'll take it down
and give it a good clean some day. I suppose it's almost time we were
leaving. I must start washing this paint off. What a bore! I'll get the
lipstick off your face afterwards.'
Winston did not get up for a few minutes more. The room was darkening. He
turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight.
The inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the
interior of the glass itself. There was such a depth of it, and yet it was
almost as transparent as air. It was as though the surface of the glass
had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere
complete. He had the feeling that he could get inside it, and that in
fact he was inside it, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table,
and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself. The
paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was Julia's life and his
own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.
Chapter 5
Syme had vanished. A morning came, and he was missing from work: a few
thoughtless people commented on his absence. On the next day nobody
mentioned him. On the third day Winston went into the vestibule of the
Records Department to look at the notice-board. One of the notices carried
a printed list of the members of the Chess Committee, of whom Syme had
been one. It looked almost exactly as it had looked before--nothing had
been crossed out--but it was one name shorter. It was enough. Syme had
ceased to exist: he had never existed.
The weather was baking hot. In the labyrinthine Ministry the windowless,
air-conditioned rooms kept their normal temperature, but outside the
pavements scorched one's feet and the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours
was a horror. The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, and the
staffs of all the Ministries were working overtime. Processions, meetings,
military parades, lectures, waxworks, displays, film shows, telescreen
programmes all had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigies
built, slogans coined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographs
faked. Julia's unit in the Fiction Department had been taken off the
production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets.
Winston, in addition to his regular work, spent long periods every day in
going through back files of 'The Times' and altering and embellishing news
items which were to be quoted in speeches. Late at night, when crowds of
rowdy proles roamed the streets, the town had a curiously febrile air. The
rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever, and sometimes in the far distance
there were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about which
there were wild rumours.
The new tune which was to be the theme-song of Hate Week (the Hate Song,
it was called) had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged
on the telescreens. It had a savage, barking rhythm which could not exactly
be called music, but resembled the beating of a drum. Roared out by
hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, it was terrifying. The
proles had taken a fancy to it, and in the midnight streets it competed
with the still-popular 'It was only a hopeless fancy'. The Parsons children
played it at all hours of the night and day, unbearably, on a comb and a
piece of toilet paper. Winston's evenings were fuller than ever. Squads of
volunteers, organized by Parsons, were preparing the street for Hate Week,
stitching banners, painting posters, erecting flagstaffs on the roofs, and
perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers.
Parsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would display four hundred
metres of bunting. He was in his native element and as happy as a lark.
The heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting
to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings. He was everywhere at once,
pushing, pulling, sawing, hammering, improvising, jollying everyone along
with comradely exhortations and giving out from every fold of his body what
seemed an inexhaustible supply of acrid-smelling sweat.
A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London. It had no caption,
and represented simply the monstrous figure of a Eurasian soldier, three
or four metres high, striding forward with expressionless Mongolian face
and enormous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. From whatever
angle you looked at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified by the
foreshortening, seemed to be pointed straight at you. The thing had been
plastered on every blank space on every wall, even outnumbering the
portraits of Big Brother. The proles, normally apathetic about the war,
were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism.
As though to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had been
killing larger numbers of people than usual. One fell on a crowded film
theatre in Stepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins. The
whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long, trailing
funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting.
Another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playground
and several dozen children were blown to pieces. There were further angry
demonstrations, Goldstein was burned in effigy, hundreds of copies of the
poster of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames, and
a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew round
that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, and
an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their
house set on fire and perished of suffocation.
In the room over Mr Charrington's shop, when they could get there, Julia
and Winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window,
naked for the sake of coolness. The rat had never come back, but the bugs
had multiplied hideously in the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty or
clean, the room was paradise. As soon as they arrived they would sprinkle
everything with pepper bought on the black market, tear off their clothes,
and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that
the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counter-attack.
Four, five, six--seven times they met during the month of June. Winston
had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. He seemed to have lost
the need for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided,
leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of
coughing in the early morning had stopped. The process of life had ceased
to be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the
telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice. Now that they had a
secure hiding-place, almost a home, it did not even seem a hardship that
they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time.
What mattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist. To know
that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. The room
was a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk.
Mr Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal. He usually
stopped to talk with Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs.
The old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors, and on the other
hand to have almost no customers. He led a ghostlike existence between the
tiny, dark shop, and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his
meals and which contained, among other things, an unbelievably ancient
gramophone with an enormous horn. He seemed glad of the opportunity to
talk. Wandering about among his worthless stock, with his long nose and
thick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had
always vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman.
With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or
that--a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken snuffbox, a
pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby's hair--never
asking that Winston should buy it, merely that he should admire it. To
talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical-box.
He had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of
forgotten rhymes. There was one about four and twenty blackbirds, and
another about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the death
of poor Cock Robin. 'It just occurred to me you might be interested,' he
would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a new
fragment. But he could never recall more than a few lines of any one
rhyme.
Both of them knew--in a way, it was never out of their minds that what
was now happening could not last long. There were times when the fact of
impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would
cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned soul
grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five
minutes of striking. But there were also times when they had the illusion
not only of safety but of permanence. So long as they were actually in
this room, they both felt, no harm could come to them. Getting there was
difficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It was as when
Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that
it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside
it time could be arrested. Often they gave themselves up to daydreams of
escape. Their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their
intrigue, just like this, for the remainder of their natural lives. Or
Katharine would die, and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston and Julia would
succeed in getting married. Or they would commit suicide together. Or
they would disappear, alter themselves out of recognition, learn to speak
with proletarian accents, get jobs in a factory and live out their lives
undetected in a back-street. It was all nonsense, as they both knew. In
reality there was no escape. Even the one plan that was practicable,
suicide, they had no intention of carrying out. To hang on from day to day
and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed
an unconquerable instinct, just as one's lungs will always draw the next
breath so long as there is air available.
Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the
Party, but with no notion of how to take the first step. Even if the
fabulous Brotherhood was a reality, there still remained the difficulty
of finding one's way into it. He told her of the strange intimacy that
existed, or seemed to exist, between himself and O'Brien, and of the
impulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into O'Brien's presence, announce
that he was the enemy of the Party, and demand his help. Curiously enough,
this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do. She was used to
judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that Winston
should believe O'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash
of the eyes. Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly
everyone, secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thought
it safe to do so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organized
opposition existed or could exist. The tales about Goldstein and his
underground army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the Party
had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe
in. Times beyond number, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations,
she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose
names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the
faintest belief. When public trials were happening she had taken her place
in the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts from
morning to night, chanting at intervals 'Death to the traitors!' During
the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults
at Goldstein. Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Goldstein was and
what doctrines he was supposed to represent. She had grown up since the
Revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the
fifties and sixties. Such a thing as an independent political movement was
outside her imagination: and in any case the Party was invincible. It
would always exist, and it would always be the same. You could only rebel
against it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts of
violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up.
In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and far less susceptible
to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connexion to mention
the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her
opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on
London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, 'just to
keep people frightened'. This was an idea that had literally never occurred
to him. She also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during
the Two Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out
laughing. But she only questioned the teachings of the Party when they
in some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to accept
the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and
falsehood did not seem important to her. She believed, for instance, having
learnt it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. (In his own
schooldays, Winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the
helicopter that the Party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later,
when Julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane; one
generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when he
told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long
before the Revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting. After
all, what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was rather more
of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did
not remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasia
and at peace with Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war as
a sham: but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy
had changed. 'I thought we'd always been at war with Eurasia,' she said
vaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aeroplanes dated
from long before her birth, but the switchover in the war had happened
only four years ago, well after she was grown up. He argued with her about
it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcing
her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and
not Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still struck her as
unimportant. 'Who cares?' she said impatiently. 'It's always one bloody
war after another, and one knows the news is all lies anyway.'
Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department and the impudent
forgeries that he committed there. Such things did not appear to horrify
her. She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought
of lies becoming truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, and
Rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between
his fingers. It did not make much impression on her. At first, indeed, she
failed to grasp the point of the story.
'Were they friends of yours?' she said.
'No, I never knew them. They were Inner Party members. Besides, they were
far older men than I was. They belonged to the old days, before the
Revolution. I barely knew them by sight.'
'Then what was there to worry about? People are being killed off all the
time, aren't they?'
He tried to make her understand. 'This was an exceptional case. It wasn't
just a question of somebody being killed. Do you realize that the past,
starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives
anywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like
that lump of glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about
the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has been
destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has
been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed,
every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and
minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless
present in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that the
past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even
when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence
ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't know
with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories. Just in
that one instance, in my whole life, I did possess actual concrete evidence
after the event--years after it.'
'And what good was that?'
'It was no good, because I threw it away a few minutes later. But if the
same thing happened today, I should keep it.'
'Well, I wouldn't!' said Julia. 'I'm quite ready to take risks, but only
for something worth while, not for bits of old newspaper. What could you
have done with it even if you had kept it?'
'Not much, perhaps. But it was evidence. It might have planted a few doubts
here and there, supposing that I'd dared to show it to anybody. I don't
imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime. But one can imagine
little knots of resistance springing up here and there--small groups of
people banding themselves together, and gradually growing, and even leaving
a few records behind, so that the next generations can carry on where we
leave off.'
'I'm not interested in the next generation, dear. I'm interested in US.'
'You're only a rebel from the waist downwards,' he told her.
She thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms round him in delight.
In the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest.
Whenever he began to talk of the principles of Ingsoc, doublethink, the
mutability of the past, and the denial of objective reality, and to use
Newspeak words, she became bored and confused and said that she never paid
any attention to that kind of thing. One knew that it was all rubbish, so
why let oneself be worried by it? She knew when to cheer and when to boo,
and that was all one needed. If he persisted in talking of such subjects,
she had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep. She was one of those
people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position. Talking to her,
he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while
having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant. In a way, the world-view
of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of
understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations
of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was
demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to
notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane.
They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm,
because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass
undigested through the body of a bird.
Chapter 6
It had happened at last. The expected message had come. All his life, it
seemed to him, he had been waiting for this to happen.
He was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry and he was almost
at the spot where Julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became
aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him. The
person, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude to
speaking. Winston stopped abruptly and turned. It was O'Brien.
At last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse was
to run away. His heart bounded violently. He would have been incapable of
speaking. O'Brien, however, had continued forward in the same movement,
laying a friendly hand for a moment on Winston's arm, so that the two of
them were walking side by side. He began speaking with the peculiar grave
courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of Inner Party members.
'I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,' he said. 'I was
reading one of your Newspeak articles in 'The Times' the other day. You
take a scholarly interest in Newspeak, I believe?'
Winston had recovered part of his self-possession. 'Hardly scholarly,' he
said. 'I'm only an amateur. It's not my subject. I have never had anything
to do with the actual construction of the language.'
'But you write it very elegantly,' said O'Brien. 'That is not only my own
opinion. I was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an
expert. His name has slipped my memory for the moment.'
Again Winston's heart stirred painfully. It was inconceivable that this
was anything other than a reference to Syme. But Syme was not only dead,
he was abolished, an unperson. Any identifiable reference to him would have
been mortally dangerous. O'Brien's remark must obviously have been intended
as a signal, a codeword. By sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had
turned the two of them into accomplices. They had continued to stroll
slowly down the corridor, but now O'Brien halted. With the curious,
disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he
resettled his spectacles on his nose. Then he went on:
'What I had really intended to say was that in your article I noticed you
had used two words which have become obsolete. But they have only become
so very recently. Have you seen the tenth edition of the Newspeak
Dictionary?'
'No,' said Winston. 'I didn't think it had been issued yet. We are still
using the ninth in the Records Department.'
'The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months, I believe. But a
few advance copies have been circulated. I have one myself. It might
interest you to look at it, perhaps?'
'Very much so,' said Winston, immediately seeing where this tended.
'Some of the new developments are most ingenious. The reduction in the
number of verbs--that is the point that will appeal to you, I think. Let
me see, shall I send a messenger to you with the dictionary? But I am
afraid I invariably forget anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pick
it up at my flat at some time that suited you? Wait. Let me give you my
address.'
They were standing in front of a telescreen. Somewhat absent-mindedly
O'Brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather-covered
notebook and a gold ink-pencil. Immediately beneath the telescreen, in
such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the
instrument could read what he was writing, he scribbled an address, tore
out the page and handed it to Winston.
'I am usually at home in the evenings,' he said. 'If not, my servant will
give you the dictionary.'
He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper, which this time
there was no need to conceal. Nevertheless he carefully memorized what was
written on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along
with a mass of other papers.
They had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most.
There was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have. It had
been contrived as a way of letting Winston know O'Brien's address. This
was necessary, because except by direct enquiry it was never possible to
discover where anyone lived. There were no directories of any kind. 'If
you ever want to see me, this is where I can be found,' was what O'Brien
had been saying to him. Perhaps there would even be a message concealed
somewhere in the dictionary. But at any rate, one thing was certain. The
conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and he had reached the outer
edges of it.
He knew that sooner or later he would obey O'Brien's summons. Perhaps
tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay--he was not certain. What was
happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years
ago. The first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second
had been the opening of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to words,
and now from words to actions. The last step was something that would
happen in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted it. The end was contained
in the beginning. But it was frightening: or, more exactly, it was like
a foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. Even while he was
speaking to O'Brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a chilly
shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. He had the sensation
of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much better
because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him.
Chapter 7
Winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. Julia rolled sleepily
against him, murmuring something that might have been 'What's the matter?'
'I dreamt--' he began, and stopped short. It was too complex to be put
into words. There was the dream itself, and there was a memory connected
with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking.
He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmosphere of the
dream. It was a vast, luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to
stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain.
It had all occurred inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the
glass was the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything was flooded
with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances.
The dream had also been comprehended by--indeed, in some sense it had
consisted in--a gesture of the arm made by his mother, and made again
thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on the news film,
trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the helicopter
blew them both to pieces.
'Do you know,' he said, 'that until this moment I believed I had murdered
my mother?'
'Why did you murder her?' said Julia, almost asleep.
'I didn't murder her. Not physically.'
In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother, and within
a few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had all
come back. It was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of
his consciousness over many years. He was not certain of the date, but he
could not have been less than ten years old, possibly twelve, when it had
happened.
His father had disappeared some time earlier, how much earlier he could
not remember. He remembered better the rackety, uneasy circumstances of
the time: the periodical panics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tube
stations, the piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proclamations
posted at street corners, the gangs of youths in shirts all the same
colour, the enormous queues outside the bakeries, the intermittent
machine-gun fire in the distance--above all, the fact that there was
never enough to eat. He remembered long afternoons spent with other boys
in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps, picking out the ribs of
cabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust
from which they carefully scraped away the cinders; and also in waiting
for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were
known to carry cattle feed, and which, when they jolted over the bad
patches in the road, sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil-cake.
When his father disappeared, his mother did not show any surprise or any
violent grief, but a sudden change came over her. She seemed to have
become completely spiritless. It was evident even to Winston that she was
waiting for something that she knew must happen. She did everything that
was needed--cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, swept the floor, dusted
the mantelpiece--always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous
motion, like an artist's lay-figure moving of its own accord. Her large
shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. For hours at a
time she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nursing his young sister,
a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two or three, with a face made simian
by thinness. Very occasionally she would take Winston in her arms and
press him against her for a long time without saying anything. He was
aware, in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness, that this was somehow
connected with the never-mentioned thing that was about to happen.
He remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close-smelling room that
seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane. There was a gas ring
in the fender, and a shelf where food was kept, and on the landing outside
there was a brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. He remembered
his mother's statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something
in a saucepan. Above all he remembered his continuous hunger, and the
fierce sordid battles at mealtimes. He would ask his mother naggingly,
over and over again, why there was not more food, he would shout and storm
at her (he even remembered the tones of his voice, which was beginning to
break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would
attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his
share. His mother was quite ready to give him more than his share. She
took it for granted that he, 'the boy', should have the biggest portion;
but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more. At every meal
she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little
sister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. He would cry out
with rage when she stopped ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepan
and spoon out of her hands, he would grab bits from his sister's plate.
He knew that he was starving the other two, but he could not help it; he
even felt that he had a right to do it. The clamorous hunger in his belly
seemed to justify him. Between meals, if his mother did not stand guard,
he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf.
One day a chocolate ration was issued. There had been no such issue for
weeks or months past. He remembered quite clearly that precious little
morsel of chocolate. It was a two-ounce slab (they still talked about
ounces in those days) between the three of them. It was obvious that it
ought to be divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he were
listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself demanding in a loud
booming voice that he should be given the whole piece. His mother told him
not to be greedy. There was a long, nagging argument that went round and
round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings. His tiny
sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a baby monkey,
sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. In the
end his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to
Winston, giving the other quarter to his sister. The little girl took hold
of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. Winston
stood watching her for a moment. Then with a sudden swift spring he had
snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister's hand and was fleeing
for the door.
'Winston, Winston!' his mother called after him. 'Come back! Give your
sister back her chocolate!'
He stopped, but did not come back. His mother's anxious eyes were fixed on
his face. Even now he was thinking about the thing, he did not know what
it was that was on the point of happening. His sister, conscious of having
been robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. His mother drew her
arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast. Something in
the gesture told him that his sister was dying. He turned and fled down
the stairs, with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand.
He never saw his mother again. After he had devoured the chocolate he felt
somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several
hours, until hunger drove him home. When he came back his mother had
disappeared. This was already becoming normal at that time. Nothing was
gone from the room except his mother and his sister. They had not taken
any clothes, not even his mother's overcoat. To this day he did not know
with any certainty that his mother was dead. It was perfectly possible
that she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for his sister,
she might have been removed, like Winston himself, to one of the colonies
for homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were called) which had
grown up as a result of the civil war, or she might have been sent to the
labour camp along with his mother, or simply left somewhere or other
to die.
The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping protecting
gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained. His
mind went back to another dream of two months ago. Exactly as his mother
had sat on the dingy white-quilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so
she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him, and drowning deeper
every minute, but still looking up at him through the darkening water.
He told Julia the story of his mother's disappearance. Without opening her
eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position.
'I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,' she said
indistinctly. 'All children are swine.'
'Yes. But the real point of the story----'
From her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again.
He would have liked to continue talking about his mother. He did not
suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an unusual
woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of
nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyed
were private ones. Her feelings were her own, and could not be altered
from outside. It would not have occurred to her that an action which is
ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved
him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. When
the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in
her arms. It was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce more
chocolate, it did not avert the child's death or her own; but it seemed
natural to her to do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also covered
the little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the bullets
than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Party had done was to
persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while
at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. When
once you were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel,
what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference.
Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever
heard of again. You were lifted clean out of the stream of history. And
yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed
all-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. They
were governed by private loyalties which they did not question. What
mattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture,
an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in
itself. The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this
condition. They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they
were loyal to one another. For the first time in his life he did not
despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would
one day spring to life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed
human. They had not become hardened inside. They had held on to the
primitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort.
And in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few
weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked
it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk.
'The proles are human beings,' he said aloud. 'We are not human.'
'Why not?' said Julia, who had woken up again.
He thought for a little while. 'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said,
'that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here
before it's too late, and never see each other again?'
'Yes, dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I'm not going to do
it, all the same.'
'We've been lucky,' he said 'but it can't last much longer. You're young.
You look normal and innocent. If you keep clear of people like me, you
might stay alive for another fifty years.'
'No. I've thought it all out. What you do, I'm going to do. And don't be
too downhearted. I'm rather good at staying alive.'
'We may be together for another six months--a year--there's no knowing.
At the end we're certain to be apart. Do you realize how utterly alone we
shall be? When once they get hold of us there will be nothing, literally
nothing, that either of us can do for the other. If I confess, they'll
shoot you, and if I refuse to confess, they'll shoot you just the same.
Nothing that I can do or say, or stop myself from saying, will put off
your death for as much as five minutes. Neither of us will even know
whether the other is alive or dead. We shall be utterly without power of
any kind. The one thing that matters is that we shouldn't betray one
another, although even that can't make the slightest difference.'
'If you mean confessing,' she said, 'we shall do that, right enough.
Everybody always confesses. You can't help it. They torture you.'
'I don't mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do
doesn't matter: only feelings matter. If they could make me stop loving
you--that would be the real betrayal.'
She thought it over. 'They can't do that,' she said finally. 'It's the one
thing they can't do. They can make you say anything--ANYTHING--but they
can't make you believe it. They can't get inside you.'
'No,' he said a little more hopefully, 'no; that's quite true. They can't
get inside you. If you can FEEL that staying human is worth while, even
when it can't have any result whatever, you've beaten them.'
He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear. They could spy
upon you night and day, but if you kept your head you could still outwit
them. With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of
finding out what another human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less
true when you were actually in their hands. One did not know what happened
inside the Ministry of Love, but it was possible to guess: tortures, drugs,
delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions, gradual
wearing-down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning.
Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They could be tracked down
by enquiry, they could be squeezed out of you by torture. But if the object
was not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference did it ultimately
make? They could not alter your feelings: for that matter you could not
alter them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in the
utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the
inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained
impregnable.
Chapter 8
They had done it, they had done it at last!
The room they were standing in was long-shaped and softly lit. The
telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the richness of the dark-blue carpet
gave one the impression of treading on velvet. At the far end of the room
O'Brien was sitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of
papers on either side of him. He had not bothered to look up when the
servant showed Julia and Winston in.
Winston's heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be
able to speak. They had done it, they had done it at last, was all he
could think. It had been a rash act to come here at all, and sheer folly
to arrive together; though it was true that they had come by different
routes and only met on O'Brien's doorstep. But merely to walk into such a
place needed an effort of the nerve. It was only on very rare occasions
that one saw inside the dwelling-places of the Inner Party, or even
penetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived. The whole
atmosphere of the huge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness of
everything, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco, the
silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the white-jacketed
servants hurrying to and fro--everything was intimidating. Although he had
a good pretext for coming here, he was haunted at every step by the fear
that a black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner,
demand his papers, and order him to get out. O'Brien's servant, however,
had admitted the two of them without demur. He was a small, dark-haired
man in a white jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless
face which might have been that of a Chinese. The passage down which he
led them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white
wainscoting, all exquisitely clean. That too was intimidating. Winston
could not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not
grimy from the contact of human bodies.
O'Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studying
it intently. His heavy face, bent down so that one could see the line of
the nose, looked both formidable and intelligent. For perhaps twenty
seconds he sat without stirring. Then he pulled the speakwrite towards
him and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the Ministries:
'Items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion
contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stop
unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machinery
overheads stop end message.'
He rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the
soundless carpet. A little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallen
away from him with the Newspeak words, but his expression was grimmer than
usual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. The terror that
Winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary
embarrassment. It seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a
stupid mistake. For what evidence had he in reality that O'Brien was any
kind of political conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single
equivocal remark: beyond that, only his own secret imaginings, founded on
a dream. He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to
borrow the dictionary, because in that case Julia's presence was impossible
to explain. As O'Brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike
him. He stopped, turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall. There was
a sharp snap. The voice had stopped.
Julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. Even in the midst
of his panic, Winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his
tongue.
'You can turn it off!' he said.
'Yes,' said O'Brien, 'we can turn it off. We have that privilege.'
He was opposite them now. His solid form towered over the pair of them,
and the expression on his face was still indecipherable. He was waiting,
somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what? Even now it was
quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he
had been interrupted. Nobody spoke. After the stopping of the telescreen
the room seemed deadly silent. The seconds marched past, enormous. With
difficulty Winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O'Brien's. Then
suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings
of a smile. With his characteristic gesture O'Brien resettled his
spectacles on his nose.
'Shall I say it, or will you?' he said.
'I will say it,' said Winston promptly. 'That thing is really turned off?'
'Yes, everything is turned off. We are alone.'
'We have come here because----'
He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of
his own motives. Since he did not in fact know what kind of
help he expected from O'Brien, it was not easy to say why he
had come here. He went on, conscious that what he was saying
must sound both feeble and pretentious:
'We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy, some kind of secret
organization working against the Party, and that you are involved in it.
We want to join it and work for it. We are enemies of the Party. We
disbelieve in the principles of Ingsoc. We are thought-criminals. We are
also adulterers. I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your
mercy. If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way, we are
ready.'
He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling that the door
had opened. Sure enough, the little yellow-faced servant had come in
without knocking. Winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter
and glasses.
'Martin is one of us,' said O'Brien impassively. 'Bring the drinks over
here, Martin. Put them on the round table. Have we enough chairs? Then
we may as well sit down and talk in comfort. Bring a chair for yourself,
Martin. This is business. You can stop being a servant for the next ten
minutes.'
The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with a
servant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. Winston
regarded him out of the corner of his eye. It struck him that the man's
whole life was playing a part, and that he felt it to be dangerous to
drop his assumed personality even for a moment. O'Brien took the decanter
by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. It aroused
in Winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a
hoarding--a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move
up and down and pour its contents into a glass. Seen from the top the
stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby.
It had a sour-sweet smell. He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff at
it with frank curiosity.
'It is called wine,' said O'Brien with a faint smile. 'You will have read
about it in books, no doubt. Not much of it gets to the Outer Party, I am
afraid.' His face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: 'I think it
is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. To our Leader: To
Emmanuel Goldstein.'
Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. Wine was a thing he
had read and dreamed about. Like the glass paperweight or Mr Charrington's
half-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the
olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reason
he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like
that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect. Actually,
when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing. The
truth was that after years of gin-drinking he could barely taste it. He
set down the empty glass.
'Then there is such a person as Goldstein?' he said.
'Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. Where, I do not know.'
'And the conspiracy--the organization? Is it real? It is not simply an
invention of the Thought Police?'
'No, it is real. The Brotherhood, we call it. You will never learn much
more about the Brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it.
I will come back to that presently.' He looked at his wrist-watch. 'It is
unwise even for members of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for
more than half an hour. You ought not to have come here together, and
you will have to leave separately. You, comrade'--he bowed his head to
Julia--'will leave first. We have about twenty minutes at our disposal.
You will understand that I must start by asking you certain questions.
In general terms, what are you prepared to do?'
'Anything that we are capable of,' said Winston.
O'Brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing
Winston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming to take it for granted that
Winston could speak for her. For a moment the lids flitted down over his
eyes. He began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, as
though this were a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers
were known to him already.
'You are prepared to give your lives?'
'Yes.'
'You are prepared to commit murder?'
'Yes.'
'To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of
innocent people?'
'Yes.'
'To betray your country to foreign powers?'
'Yes.'
'You are prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to corrupt the minds
of children, to distribute habit-forming drugs, to encourage prostitution,
to disseminate venereal diseases--to do anything which is likely to cause
demoralization and weaken the power of the Party?'
'Yes.'
'If, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric
acid in a child's face--are you prepared to do that?'
'Yes.'
'You are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life
as a waiter or a dock-worker?'
'Yes.'
'You are prepared to commit suicide, if and when we order you to do so?'
'Yes.'
'You are prepared, the two of you, to separate and never see one another
again?'
'No!' broke in Julia.
It appeared to Winston that a long time passed before he answered. For a
moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech. His
tongue worked soundlessly, forming the opening syllables first of one word,
then of the other, over and over again. Until he had said it, he did not
know which word he was going to say. 'No,' he said finally.
'You did well to tell me,' said O'Brien. 'It is necessary for us to know
everything.'
He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice with somewhat more
expression in it:
'Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a different
person? We may be obliged to give him a new identity. His face, his
movements, the shape of his hands, the colour of his hair--even his voice
would be different. And you yourself might have become a different person.
Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. Sometimes it is
necessary. Sometimes we even amputate a limb.'
Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martin's
Mongolian face. There were no scars that he could see. Julia had turned a
shade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced O'Brien
boldly. She murmured something that seemed to be assent.
'Good. Then that is settled.'
There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a rather
absent-minded air O'Brien pushed them towards the others, took one himself,
then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could think
better standing. They were very good cigarettes, very thick and
well-packed, with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. O'Brien looked at
his wrist-watch again.
'You had better go back to your Pantry, Martin,' he said. 'I shall switch
on in a quarter of an hour. Take a good look at these comrades' faces
before you go. You will be seeing them again. I may not.'
Exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man's dark eyes
flickered over their faces. There was not a trace of friendliness in his
manner. He was memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest in
them, or appeared to feel none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic
face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression. Without speaking
or giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out, closing the door
silently behind him. O'Brien was strolling up and down, one hand in the
pocket of his black overalls, the other holding his cigarette.
'You understand,' he said, 'that you will be fighting in the dark. You
will always be in the dark. You will receive orders and you will obey them,
without knowing why. Later I shall send you a book from which you will
learn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which
we shall destroy it. When you have read the book, you will be full members
of the Brotherhood. But between the general aims that we are fighting for
and the immediate tasks of the moment, you will never know anything. I
tell you that the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether it
numbers a hundred members, or ten million. From your personal knowledge
you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen. You
will have three or four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time as
they disappear. As this was your first contact, it will be preserved. When
you receive orders, they will come from me. If we find it necessary to
communicate with you, it will be through Martin. When you are finally
caught, you will confess. That is unavoidable. But you will have very
little to confess, other than your own actions. You will not be able to
betray more than a handful of unimportant people. Probably you will not
even betray me. By that time I may be dead, or I shall have become a
different person, with a different face.'
He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. In spite of the
bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements. It
came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket,
or manipulated a cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave an
impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. However
much in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness that
belongs to a fanatic. When he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease,
amputated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air of persiflage.
'This is unavoidable,' his voice seemed to say; 'this is what we have got
to do, unflinchingly. But this is not what we shall be doing when life is
worth living again.' A wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out
from Winston towards O'Brien. For the moment he had forgotten the shadowy
figure of Goldstein. When you looked at O'Brien's powerful shoulders and
his blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible
to believe that he could be defeated. There was no stratagem that he was
not equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia seemed to
be impressed. She had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently.
O'Brien went on:
'You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood. No doubt
you have formed your own picture of it. You have imagined, probably, a
huge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling
messages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special
movements of the hand. Nothing of the kind exists. The members of the
Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible
for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others.
Goldstein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police, could
not give them a complete list of members, or any information that would
lead them to a complete list. No such list exists. The Brotherhood cannot
be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense.
Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible. You
will never have anything to sustain you, except the idea. You will get no
comradeship and no encouragement. When finally you are caught, you will
get no help. We never help our members. At most, when it is absolutely
necessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally able to
smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner's cell. You will have to get used
to living without results and without hope. You will work for a while,
you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. Those are
the only results that you will ever see. There is no possibility that any
perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime. We are the dead.
Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls
of dust and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there
is no knowing. It might be a thousand years. At present nothing is possible
except to extend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act
collectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to
individual, generation after generation. In the face of the Thought Police
there is no other way.'
He halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch.
'It is almost time for you to leave, comrade,' he said to Julia. 'Wait.
The decanter is still half full.'
He filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem.
'What shall it be this time?' he said, still with the same faint
suggestion of irony. 'To the confusion of the Thought Police? To the
death of Big Brother? To humanity? To the future?'
'To the past,' said Winston.
'The past is more important,' agreed O'Brien gravely.
They emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia stood up to go.
O'Brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat
white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. It was important,
he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very
observant. As soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget
her existence. He took another pace or two up and down, then stopped.
'There are details to be settled,' he said. 'I assume that you have a
hiding-place of some kind?'
Winston explained about the room over Mr Charrington's shop.
'That will do for the moment. Later we will arrange something else for you.
It is important to change one's hiding-place frequently. Meanwhile I shall
send you a copy of THE BOOK'--even O'Brien, Winston noticed, seemed to
pronounce the words as though they were in italics--'Goldstein's book, you
understand, as soon as possible. It may be some days before I can get hold
of one. There are not many in existence, as you can imagine. The Thought
Police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce
them. It makes very little difference. The book is indestructible. If
the last copy were gone, we could reproduce it almost word for word. Do
you carry a brief-case to work with you?' he added.
'As a rule, yes.'
'What is it like?'
'Black, very shabby. With two straps.'
'Black, two straps, very shabby--good. One day in the fairly near
future--I cannot give a date--one of the messages among your morning's
work will contain a misprinted word, and you will have to ask for a
repeat. On the following day you will go to work without your brief-case.
At some time during the day, in the street, a man will touch you on the
arm and say "I think you have dropped your brief-case." The one he gives
you will contain a copy of Goldstein's book. You will return it within
fourteen days.'
They were silent for a moment.
'There are a couple of minutes before you need go,' said O'Brien. 'We
shall meet again--if we do meet again----'
Winston looked up at him. 'In the place where there is no darkness?'
he said hesitantly.
O'Brien nodded without appearance of surprise. 'In the place where there
is no darkness,' he said, as though he had recognized the allusion. 'And
in the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave?
Any message? Any question?.'
Winston thought. There did not seem to be any further question that he
wanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding
generalities. Instead of anything directly connected with O'Brien or the
Brotherhood, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the
dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and the little room
over Mr Charrington's shop, and the glass paperweight, and the steel
engraving in its rosewood frame. Almost at random he said:
'Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins "Oranges and lemons,
say the bells of St Clement's"?'
Again O'Brien nodded. With a sort of grave courtesy he completed the
stanza:
  'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,
  You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,
  When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey,
  When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch.'
'You knew the last line!' said Winston.
'Yes, I knew the last line. And now, I am afraid, it is time for you to go.
But wait. You had better let me give you one of these tablets.'
As Winston stood up O'Brien held out a hand. His powerful grip crushed
the bones of Winston's palm. At the door Winston looked back, but O'Brien
seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind. He was waiting
with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen. Beyond him
Winston could see the writing-table with its green-shaded lamp and the
speakwrite and the wire baskets deep-laden with papers. The incident was
closed. Within thirty seconds, it occurred to him, O'Brien would be back
at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the Party.
Chapter 9
Winston was gelatinous with fatigue. Gelatinous was the right word. It had
come into his head spontaneously. His body seemed to have not only the
weakness of a jelly, but its translucency. He felt that if he held up his
hand he would be able to see the light through it. All the blood and
lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving
only a frail structure of nerves, bones, and skin. All sensations seemed
to be magnified. His overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled
his feet, even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made
his joints creak.
He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So had everyone else in
the Ministry. Now it was all over, and he had literally nothing to do, no
Party work of any description, until tomorrow morning. He could spend six
hours in the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, in
mild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the direction
of Mr Charrington's shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols, but
irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone
interfering with him. The heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumped
against his knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and down
the skin of his leg. Inside it was the book, which he had now had in his
possession for six days and had not yet opened, nor even looked at.
On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the speeches, the
shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, the films, the waxworks,
the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet,
the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes,
the booming of guns--after six days of this, when the great orgasm was
quivering to its climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled up
into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the
2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last
day of the proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them to
pieces--at just this moment it had been announced that Oceania was not
after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Eurasia
was an ally.
There was, of course, no admission that any change had taken place. Merely
it became known, with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once, that
Eastasia and not Eurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a
demonstration in one of the central London squares at the moment when it
happened. It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were
luridly floodlit. The square was packed with several thousand people,
including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the
Spies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the Inner Party, a small
lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over
which a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd. A little
Rumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the
microphone with one hand while the other, enormous at the end of a bony
arm, clawed the air menacingly above his head. His voice, made metallic by
the amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres,
deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of
civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties. It was
almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then
maddened. At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the
voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose
uncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most savage yells of all
came from the schoolchildren. The speech had been proceeding for perhaps
twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of
paper was slipped into the speaker's hand. He unrolled and read it without
pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice or manner, or in the
content of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different.
Without words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd.
Oceania was at war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendous
commotion. The banners and posters with which the square was decorated
were all wrong! Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. It was
sabotage! The agents of Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous
interlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds
and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies of activity in
clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from
the chimneys. But within two or three minutes it was all over. The orator,
still gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward,
his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech.
One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the
crowd. The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had
been changed.
The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had
switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence, not only
without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax. But at the moment
he had other things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorder
while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not
see had tapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Excuse me, I think you've
dropped your brief-case.' He took the brief-case abstractedly, without
speaking. He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to
look inside it. The instant that the demonstration was over he went
straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the time was now nearly
twenty-three hours. The entire staff of the Ministry had done likewise.
The orders already issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to their
posts, were hardly necessary.
Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with
Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was now
completely obsolete. Reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books,
pamphlets, films, sound-tracks, photographs--all had to be rectified at
lightning speed. Although no directive was ever issued, it was known that
the chiefs of the Department intended that within one week no reference
to the war with Eurasia, or the alliance with Eastasia, should remain in
existence anywhere. The work was overwhelming, all the more so because
the processes that it involved could not be called by their true
names. Everyone in the Records Department worked eighteen hours in the
twenty-four, with two three-hour snatches of sleep. Mattresses were brought
up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted of
sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from
the canteen. Each time that Winston broke off for one of his spells of
sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work, and each time that he
crawled back sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that another shower
of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift, half-burying the
speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor, so that the first job was
always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work.
What was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical.
Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another, but any
detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the
geographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from one
part of the world to another was considerable.
By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping
every few minutes. It was like struggling with some crushing physical task,
something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless
neurotically anxious to accomplish. In so far as he had time to remember
it, he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the
speakwrite, every stroke of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie. He was
as anxious as anyone else in the Department that the forgery should be
perfect. On the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed
down. For as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube; then one
more cylinder, then nothing. Everywhere at about the same time the work
was easing off. A deep and as it were secret sigh went through the
Department. A mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, had been
achieved. It was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary
evidence that the war with Eurasia had ever happened. At twelve hundred it
was unexpectedly announced that all workers in the Ministry were free till
tomorrow morning. Winston, still carrying the brief-case containing the
book, which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his
body while he slept, went home, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep in
his bath, although the water was barely more than tepid.
With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above
Mr Charrington's shop. He was tired, but not sleepy any longer. He opened
the window, lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for
coffee. Julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book. He
sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case.
A heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the
cover. The print also looked slightly irregular. The pages were worn at
the edges, and fell apart, easily, as though the book had passed through
many hands. The inscription on the title-page ran:
  THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF
  OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM
  by
  Emmanuel Goldstein
Winston began reading:
Chapter I
Ignorance is Strength
Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age,
there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle,
and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne
countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their
attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the
essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous
upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always
reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium,
however far it is pushed one way or the other.
The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable...
Winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he
was reading, in comfort and safety. He was alone: no telescreen, no ear at
the keyhole, no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the
page with his hand. The sweet summer air played against his cheek. From
somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children: in the room
itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock. He settled
deeper into the arm-chair and put his feet up on the fender. It was bliss,
it was eternity. Suddenly, as one sometimes does with a book of which one
knows that one will ultimately read and re-read every word, he opened it
at a different place and found himself at Chapter III. He went on reading:
Chapter III
War is Peace
The splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event
which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth
century. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire
by the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and
Oceania, were already effectively in being. The third, Eastasia, only
emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. The
frontiers between the three super-states are in some places arbitrary, and
in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general
they follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the whole of the northern
part of the European and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the Bering
Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands including the
British Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa. Eastasia,
smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier,
comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese islands
and a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.
In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently at
war, and have been so for the past twenty-five years. War, however, is no
longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early
decades of the twentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims between
combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause
for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference.
This is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing
attitude towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous.
On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries,
and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction
of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which
extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal,
and, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy,
meritorious. But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of
people, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few
casualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague
frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round
the Floating Fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In
the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage
of consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may
cause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact changed its character. More
exactly, the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of
importance. Motives which were already present to some small extent in the
great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and
are consciously recognized and acted upon.
To understand the nature of the present war--for in spite of the regrouping
which occurs every few years, it is always the same war--one must realize
in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of
the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other
two in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences
are too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces, Oceania
by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity
and industriousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in
a material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment of
self-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared
to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of
previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials
is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three
super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that
it needs within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct
economic purpose, it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers of
the super-states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them,
there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville,
Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population
of the earth. It is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions,
and of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are constantly
struggling. In practice no one power ever controls the whole of the
disputed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is the
chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery
that dictates the endless changes of alignment.
All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some of
them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder
climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods.
But above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whichever
power controls equatorial Africa, or the countries of the Middle East, or
Southern India, or the Indonesian Archipelago, disposes also of the bodies
of scores or hundreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies.
The inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the status
of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror, and are expended
like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments, to capture
more territory, to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments,
to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It should be noted that
the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas.
The frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the Congo
and the northern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the Indian
Ocean and the Pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured by
Oceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia the dividing line between Eurasia and
Eastasia is never stable; round the Pole all three powers lay claim to
enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored:
but the balance of power always remains roughly even, and the territory
which forms the heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate.
Moreover, the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is not
really necessary to the world's economy. They add nothing to the wealth of
the world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war, and
the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which
to wage another war. By their labour the slave populations allow the tempo
of continuous warfare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist, the
structure of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself,
would not be essentially different.
The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of
DOUBLETHINK, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by
the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the
machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end
of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of
consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when
few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not
urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes
of destruction had been at work. The world of today is a bare, hungry,
dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, and
still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of
that period looked forward. In the early twentieth century, the vision of
a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient--a
glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete--was
part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person. Science and
technology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to
assume that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly
because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and
revolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on
the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly
regimented society. As a whole the world is more primitive today than it
was fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced, and various
devices, always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage,
have been developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped,
and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never been
fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still
there. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it
was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and
therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the
machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt,
illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations.
And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of
automatic process--by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible
not to distribute--the machine did raise the living standards of the
average human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at
the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.
But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the
destruction--indeed, in some sense was the destruction--of a hierarchical
society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to
eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed
a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most
important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once
became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no
doubt, to imagine a society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personal
possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while POWER
remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such
a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were
enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally
stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for
themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later
realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep
it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a
basis of poverty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as
some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of
doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency
towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost
the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially
backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated,
directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals.
Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by
restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during
the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy
of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation,
capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were
prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this,
too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted
were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was
how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real
wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be
distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by
continuous warfare.
The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives,
but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces,
or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea,
materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable,
and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are
not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of
expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.
A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that
would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as
obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with
further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle
the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might
exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs
of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is
a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on
as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups
somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity
increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the
distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early
twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere,
laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy
his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the
better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three
servants, his private motor-car or helicopter--set him in a different world
from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have
a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call
'the proles'. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the
possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and
poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and
therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste
seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.
War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but
accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would
be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building
temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even
by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. But
this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a
hierarchical society. What is concerned here is not the morale of masses,
whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work,
but the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is
expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow
limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant
fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic
triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality
appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is
actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does
not matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is
that a state of war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence which
the Party requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an
atmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks
one goes, the more marked it becomes. It is precisely in the Inner Party
that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest. In his capacity
as an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party
to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often
be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or
is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such
knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK. Meanwhile
no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that
the war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with Oceania
the undisputed master of the entire world.
All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an
article of faith. It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more
and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of
power, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search
for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining
activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any
outlet. In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has
almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for 'Science'. The
empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of
the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of
Ingsoc. And even technological progress only happens when its products can
in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. In all the useful
arts the world is either standing still or going backwards. The fields are
cultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by machinery. But
in matters of vital importance--meaning, in effect, war and police
espionage--the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least
tolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of
the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent
thought. There are therefore two great problems which the Party is
concerned to solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what another
human being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred
million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand. In
so far as scientific research still continues, this is its subject matter.
The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor,
studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions,
gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of
drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist,
physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special
subject as are relevant to the taking of life. In the vast laboratories
of the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the
Brazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands of
the Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some are
concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise
larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more
and more impenetrable armour-plating; others search for new and deadlier
gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities
as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease
germs immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce
a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under
the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship;
others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays
through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space, or
producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at
the earth's centre.
But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization, and none
of the three super-states ever gains a significant lead on the others.
What is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the
atomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their present
researches are likely to discover. Although the Party, according to its
habit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as
early as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about
ten years later. At that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on
industrial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe, and
North America. The effect was to convince the ruling groups of all
countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized
society, and hence of their own power. Thereafter, although no formal
agreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All three
powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against
the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later.
And meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or
forty years. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing
planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the
fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable Floating
Fortress; but otherwise there has been little development. The tank, the
submarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand
grenade are still in use. And in spite of the endless slaughters reported
in the Press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars,
in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed
in a few weeks, have never been repeated.
None of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves
the risk of serious defeat. When any large operation is undertaken, it is
usually a surprise attack against an ally. The strategy that all three
powers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following,
is the same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and
well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely
encircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact of
friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years
as to lull suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded with atomic
bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will all
be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation
impossible. It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the
remaining world-power, in preparation for another attack. This scheme, it
is hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization.
Moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the
Equator and the Pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken.
This explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the
super-states are arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the
British Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on the other
hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine
or even to the Vistula. But this would violate the principle, followed on
all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were
to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany, it
would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great
physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred
million people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on
the Oceanic level. The problem is the same for all three super-states.
It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no
contact with foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners
and coloured slaves. Even the official ally of the moment is always
regarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the average
citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or
Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If he
were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are
creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about
them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the
fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might
evaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia,
or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers must
never be crossed by anything except bombs.
Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and
acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-states
are very much the same. In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called
Ingsoc, in Eurasia it is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is
called by a Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but perhaps
better rendered as Obliteration of the Self. The citizen of Oceania is not
allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, but
he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and
common sense. Actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable,
and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all.
Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of
semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous
warfare. It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer
one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary,
so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, like three
sheaves of corn. And, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are
simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives are
dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that
the war should continue everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile the
fact that there IS no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of
reality which is the special feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of
thought. Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that
by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character.
In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner or
later came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat. In the
past, also, war was one of the main instruments by which human societies
were kept in touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have tried
to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could
not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military
efficiency. So long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other
result generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat
had to be serious. Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or
religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when
one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four. Inefficient
nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for
efficiency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was
necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly
accurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers and history
books were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification of
the kind that is practised today would have been impossible. War was a
sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned
it was probably the most important of all safeguards. While wars could be
won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.
But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous.
When war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity.
Technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or
disregarded. As we have seen, researches that could be called scientific
are still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially a
kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results is not important.
Efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed. Nothing is
efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police. Since each of the three
super-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within
which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised. Reality
only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life--the need to
eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or
stepping out of top-storey windows, and the like. Between life and death,
and between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still a
distinction, but that is all. Cut off from contact with the outer world,
and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar
space, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down.
The rulers of such a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesars
could not be. They are obliged to prevent their followers from starving
to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged
to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals; but
once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shape
they choose.
The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is
merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant
animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of
hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It
eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the
special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. War, it will
be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups
of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and
therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another,
and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are
not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling
group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make
or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society
intact. The very word 'war', therefore, has become misleading. It would
probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to
exist. The peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the
Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been
replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same
if the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agree
to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For
in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever
from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly
permanent would be the same as a permanent war. This--although the vast
majority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense--is the
inner meaning of the Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.
Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in remote distance a
rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feeling of being alone with the
forbidden book, in a room with no telescreen, had not worn off. Solitude
and safety were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness
of his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint breeze from
the window that played upon his cheek. The book fascinated him, or more
exactly it reassured him. In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but
that was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it
had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It was
the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful,
more systematic, less fear-ridden. The best books, he perceived, are those
that tell you what you know already. He had just turned back to Chapter I
when he heard Julia's footstep on the stair and started out of his chair
to meet her. She dumped her brown tool-bag on the floor and flung herself
into his arms. It was more than a week since they had seen one another.
'I've got THE BOOK,' he said as they disentangled themselves.
'Oh, you've got it? Good,' she said without much interest, and almost
immediately knelt down beside the oil stove to make the coffee.
They did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an
hour. The evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up
the counterpane. From below came the familiar sound of singing and the
scrape of boots on the flagstones. The brawny red-armed woman whom Winston
had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard. There
seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro
between the washtub and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes
pegs and breaking forth into lusty song. Julia had settled down on her
side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep. He reached
out for the book, which was lying on the floor, and sat up against the
bedhead.
'We must read it,' he said. 'You too. All members of the Brotherhood have
to read it.'
'You read it,' she said with her eyes shut. 'Read it aloud. That's the
best way. Then you can explain it to me as you go.'
The clock's hands said six, meaning eighteen. They had three or four hours
ahead of them. He propped the book against his knees and began reading:
Chapter I
Ignorance is Strength
Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age,
there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle,
and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne
countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their
attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the
essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous
upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always
reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium,
however far it is pushed one way or the other
'Julia, are you awake?' said Winston.
'Yes, my love, I'm listening. Go on. It's marvellous.'
He continued reading:
The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of
the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change
places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim--for it
is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed
by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside
their daily lives--is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in
which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is
the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods
the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always
comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their
capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by the
Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they
are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their
objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of
servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group
splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the
struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never
even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an
exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of
a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human
being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no
advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has
ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view of
the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the
name of their masters.
By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become
obvious to many observers. There then rose schools of thinkers who
interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that
inequality was the unalterable law of human life. This doctrine, of course,
had always had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was now put
forward there was a significant change. In the past the need for a
hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the
High. It had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests,
lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had generally
been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the
grave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling for power, had always made
use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity. Now, however, the
concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not
yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long. In the
past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and
then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown.
The new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand.
Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was
the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions
of antiquity, was still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages.
But in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the
aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly
abandoned. The new movements which appeared in the middle years of the
century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as
it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim of perpetuating
UNfreedom and INequality. These new movements, of course, grew out of the
old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to their
ideology. But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze
history at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulum swing was to happen once
more, and then stop. As usual, the High were to be turned out by the
Middle, who would then become the High; but this time, by conscious
strategy, the High would be able to maintain their position permanently.
The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical
knowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which had hardly existed
before the nineteenth century. The cyclical movement of history was now
intelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it
was alterable. But the principal, underlying cause was that, as early
as the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had become
technically possible. It was still true that men were not equal in their
native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that
favoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real
need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. In earlier
ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable.
Inequality was the price of civilization. With the development of machine
production, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessary
for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary
for them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore, from
the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power,
human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to
be averted. In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was
in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of
an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of
brotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the human
imagination for thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain hold
even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change. The
heirs of the French, English, and American revolutions had partly believed
in their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality
before the law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to be
influenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth decade of the
twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were
authoritarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the
moment when it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever
name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the
general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which
had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years--imprisonment
without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions,
torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation
of whole populations--not only became common again, but were tolerated
and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and
progressive.
It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and
counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals
emerged as fully worked-out political theories. But they had been
foreshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which
had appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world
which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious. What
kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious. The new
aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists,
technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists,
teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These people, whose
origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the
working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of
monopoly industry and centralized government. As compared with their
opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by
luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what
they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition. This last
difference was cardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all the
tyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. The ruling groups
were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to
leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be
uninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church
of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reason
for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its
citizens under constant surveillance. The invention of print, however,
made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio
carried the process further. With the development of television, and
the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit
simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. Every
citizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching,
could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police
and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of
communication closed. The possibility of enforcing not only complete
obedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinion
on all subjects, now existed for the first time.
After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society
regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the new High
group, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what
was needed to safeguard its position. It had long been realized that the
only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege
are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The so-called
'abolition of private property' which took place in the middle years of
the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer
hands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners were a
group instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the
Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the
Party owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, and
disposes of the products as it thinks fit. In the years following the
Revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost
unopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of
collectivization. It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class
were expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably the
capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses,
transport--everything had been taken away from them: and since these
things were no longer private property, it followed that they must be
public property. Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement
and inherited its phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in
the Socialist programme; with the result, foreseen and intended beforehand,
that economic inequality has been made permanent.
But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than
this. There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power.
Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that
the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented
Middle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and
willingness to govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule
all four of them are present in some degree. A ruling class which could
guard against all of them would remain in power permanently. Ultimately
the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself.
After the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality
disappeared. Each of the three powers which now divide the world is in
fact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow
demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert.
The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one. The masses never
revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are
oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of
comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed. The
recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are
not now permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocations
can and do happen without having political results, because there is no
way in which discontent can become articulate. As for the problem of
over-production, which has been latent in our society since the development
of machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous warfare
(see Chapter III), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the
necessary pitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore,
the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able,
under-employed, power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism and
scepticism in their own ranks. The problem, that is to say, is educational.
It is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the
directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately
below it. The consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in
a negative way.
Given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already,
the general structure of Oceanic society. At the apex of the pyramid comes
Big Brother. Big Brother is infallible and all-powerful. Every success,
every achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, all
knowledge, all wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue
directly from his leadership and inspiration. Nobody has ever seen Big
Brother. He is a face on the hoardings, a voice on the telescreen. We
may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and there is already
considerable uncertainty as to when he was born. Big Brother is the guise
in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world. His function is
to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which
are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization.
Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party. Its numbers limited to six
millions, or something less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania.
Below the Inner Party comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is
described as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to the hands.
Below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as 'the
proles', numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the population. In the terms
of our earlier classification, the proles are the Low: for the slave
population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror
to conqueror, are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure.
In principle, membership of these three groups is not hereditary. The
child of Inner Party parents is in theory not born into the Inner Party.
Admission to either branch of the Party is by examination, taken at the
age of sixteen. Nor is there any racial discrimination, or any marked
domination of one province by another. Jews, Negroes, South Americans of
pure Indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the Party, and
the administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of
that area. In no part of Oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that
they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital. Oceania has
no capital, and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody
knows. Except that English is its chief LINGUA FRANCA and Newspeak its
official language, it is not centralized in any way. Its rulers are not
held together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. It is
true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on what
at first sight appear to be hereditary lines. There is far less to-and-fro
movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or
even in the pre-industrial age. Between the two branches of the Party
there is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much as will ensure
that weaklings are excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitious
members of the Outer Party are made harmless by allowing them to rise.
Proletarians, in practice, are not allowed to graduate into the Party. The
most gifted among them, who might possibly become nuclei of discontent,
are simply marked down by the Thought Police and eliminated. But this
state of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a matter of
principle. The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It does
not aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if there
were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be
perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of
the proletariat. In the crucial years, the fact that the Party was not a
hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition. The older kind
of Socialist, who had been trained to fight against something called
'class privilege' assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent.
He did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical,
nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been
shortlived, whereas adoptive organizations such as the Catholic Church
have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years. The essence of
oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the persistence of
a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon
the living. A ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate
its successors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but
with perpetuating itself. WHO wields power is not important, provided that
the hierarchical structure remains always the same.
All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes that
characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of
the Party and prevent the true nature of present-day society from being
perceived. Physical rebellion, or any preliminary move towards rebellion,
is at present not possible. From the proletarians nothing is to be feared.
Left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation and
from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without
any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the world
could be other than it is. They could only become dangerous if the advance
of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly;
but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the
level of popular education is actually declining. What opinions the masses
hold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. They can
be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect. In a Party
member, on the other hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion on
the most unimportant subject can be tolerated.
A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the Thought
Police. Even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone.
Wherever he may be, asleep or awake, working or resting, in his bath or in
bed, he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is
being inspected. Nothing that he does is indifferent. His friendships, his
relaxations, his behaviour towards his wife and children, the expression
of his face when he is alone, the words he mutters in sleep, even the
characteristic movements of his body, are all jealously scrutinized. Not
only any actual misdemeanour, but any eccentricity, however small, any
change of habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom
of an inner struggle, is certain to be detected. He has no freedom of
choice in any direction whatever. On the other hand his actions are not
regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour. In Oceania
there is no law. Thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean certain
death are not formally forbidden, and the endless purges, arrests,
tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment
for crimes which have actually been committed, but are merely the
wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the
future. A Party member is required to have not only the right opinions,
but the right instincts. Many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him
are never plainly stated, and could not be stated without laying bare the
contradictions inherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox
(in Newspeak a GOODTHINKER), he will in all circumstances know, without
taking thought, what is the true belief or the desirable emotion. But in
any case an elaborate mental training, undergone in childhood and grouping
itself round the Newspeak words CRIMESTOP, BLACKWHITE, and DOUBLETHINK,
makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever.
A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites
from enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred
of foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and
self-abasement before the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents
produced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards
and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes Hate, and the
speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude
are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline. The first
and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even to young
children, is called, in Newspeak, CRIMESTOP. CRIMESTOP means the faculty
of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous
thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to
perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if
they are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train
of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. CRIMESTOP,
in short, means protective stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On the
contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one's own
mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body.
Oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is
omnipotent and that the Party is infallible. But since in reality Big
Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is need
for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts.
The keyword here is BLACKWHITE. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has
two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the
habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the
plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to
say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means
also the ability to BELIEVE that black is white, and more, to KNOW that
black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary.
This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the
system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known
in Newspeak as DOUBLETHINK.
The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which is
subsidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. The subsidiary reason is that
the Party member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions
partly because he has no standards of comparison. He must be cut off from
the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is
necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and
that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising. But by
far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the
need to safeguard the infallibility of the Party. It is not merely that
speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought
up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were in
all cases right. It is also that no change in doctrine or in political
alignment can ever be admitted. For to change one's mind, or even one's
policy, is a confession of weakness. If, for example, Eurasia or Eastasia
(whichever it may be) is the enemy today, then that country must always
have been the enemy. And if the facts say otherwise then the facts must
be altered. Thus history is continuously rewritten. This day-to-day
falsification of the past, carried out by the Ministry of Truth, is as
necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and
espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love.
The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. Past events,
it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written
records and in human memories. The past is whatever the records and the
memories agree upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records
and in equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows that
the past is whatever the Party chooses to make it. It also follows that
though the past is alterable, it never has been altered in any specific
instance. For when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at
the moment, then this new version IS the past, and no different past can
ever have existed. This holds good even when, as often happens, the same
event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of
a year. At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth, and
clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now.
It will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the
training of memory. To make sure that all written records agree with
the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act. But it is also
necessary to REMEMBER that events happened in the desired manner. And if
it is necessary to rearrange one's memories or to tamper with written
records, then it is necessary to FORGET that one has done so. The trick of
doing this can be learned like any other mental technique. It is learned
by the majority of Party members, and certainly by all who are intelligent
as well as orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, 'reality
control'. In Newspeak it is called DOUBLETHINK, though DOUBLETHINK
comprises much else as well.
DOUBLETHINK means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's
mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. The Party intellectual
knows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows
that he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of DOUBLETHINK
he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated. The process has to
be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision,
but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of
falsity and hence of guilt. DOUBLETHINK lies at the very heart of Ingsoc,
since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious deception while
retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell
deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that
has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to
draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the
existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the
reality which one denies--all this is indispensably necessary. Even in
using the word DOUBLETHINK it is necessary to exercise DOUBLETHINK. For
by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a
fresh act of DOUBLETHINK one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely,
with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by means
of DOUBLETHINK that the Party has been able--and may, for all we know,
continue to be able for thousands of years--to arrest the course of
history.
All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified
or because they grew soft. Either they became stupid and arrogant, failed
to adjust themselves to changing circumstances, and were overthrown; or
they became liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should have
used force, and once again were overthrown. They fell, that is to say,
either through consciousness or through unconsciousness. It is the
achievement of the Party to have produced a system of thought in which
both conditions can exist simultaneously. And upon no other intellectual
basis could the dominion of the Party be made permanent. If one is to rule,
and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality.
For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one's own
infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes.
It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of DOUBLETHINK are
those who invented DOUBLETHINK and know that it is a vast system of mental
cheating. In our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is
happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is.
In general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delusion; the
more intelligent, the less sane. One clear illustration of this is the
fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social
scale. Those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly rational are
the subject peoples of the disputed territories. To these people the war
is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies
like a tidal wave. Which side is winning is a matter of complete
indifference to them. They are aware that a change of overlordship means
simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who
treat them in the same manner as the old ones. The slightly more favoured
workers whom we call 'the proles' are only intermittently conscious of the
war. When it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear and
hatred, but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for
long periods that the war is happening. It is in the ranks of the Party,
and above all of the Inner Party, that the true war enthusiasm is found.
World-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be
impossible. This peculiar linking-together of opposites--knowledge with
ignorance, cynicism with fanaticism--is one of the chief distinguishing
marks of Oceanic society. The official ideology abounds with contradictions
even when there is no practical reason for them. Thus, the Party rejects
and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement originally
stood, and it chooses to do this in the name of Socialism. It preaches
a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past, and it
dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual
workers and was adopted for that reason. It systematically undermines the
solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a
direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty. Even the names of the
four Ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in
their deliberate reversal of the facts. The Ministry of Peace concerns
itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love
with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These
contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary
hypocrisy; they are deliberate exercises in DOUBLETHINK. For it is only
by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely.
In no other way could the ancient cycle be broken. If human equality is
to be for ever averted--if the High, as we have called them, are to keep
their places permanently--then the prevailing mental condition must be
controlled insanity.
But there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored.
It is; WHY should human equality be averted? Supposing that the mechanics
of the process have been rightly described, what is the motive for this
huge, accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment
of time?
Here we reach the central secret. As we have seen. the mystique of the
Party, and above all of the Inner Party, depends upon DOUBLETHINK But
deeper than this lies the original motive, the never-questioned instinct
that first led to the seizure of power and brought DOUBLETHINK, the
Thought Police, continuous warfare, and all the other necessary
paraphernalia into existence afterwards. This motive really consists...
Winston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware of a new sound. It
seemed to him that Julia had been very still for some time past. She was
lying on her side, naked from the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowed
on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. Her breast rose
and fell slowly and regularly.
'Julia.'
No answer.
'Julia, are you awake?'
No answer. She was asleep. He shut the book, put it carefully on the floor,
lay down, and pulled the coverlet over both of them.
He had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret. He understood
HOW; he did not understand WHY. Chapter I, like Chapter III, had not
actually told him anything that he did not know, it had merely systematized
the knowledge that he possessed already. But after reading it he knew
better than before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, even a
minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was
untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you
were not mad. A yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through the
window and fell across the pillow. He shut his eyes. The sun on his face
and the girl's smooth body touching his own gave him a strong, sleepy,
confident feeling. He was safe, everything was all right. He fell asleep
murmuring 'Sanity is not statistical,' with the feeling that this remark
contained in it a profound wisdom.
*****
When he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time,
but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him that it was only
twenty-thirty. He lay dozing for a while; then the usual deep-lunged
singing struck up from the yard below:
  'It was only an 'opeless fancy,
  It passed like an Ipril dye,
  But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred
  They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!'
The drivelling song seemed to have kept its popularity. You still heard it
all over the place. It had outlived the Hate Song. Julia woke at the
sound, stretched herself luxuriously, and got out of bed.
'I'm hungry,' she said. 'Let's make some more coffee. Damn! The stove's
gone out and the water's cold.' She picked the stove up and shook it.
'There's no oil in it.'
'We can get some from old Charrington, I expect.'
'The funny thing is I made sure it was full. I'm going to put my clothes
on,' she added. 'It seems to have got colder.'
Winston also got up and dressed himself. The indefatigable voice sang on:
  'They sye that time 'eals all things,
  They sye you can always forget;
  But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years
  They twist my 'eart-strings yet!'
As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window.
The sun must have gone down behind the houses; it was not shining into the
yard any longer. The flagstones were wet as though they had just been
washed, and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh
and pale was the blue between the chimney-pots. Tirelessly the woman
marched to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and falling
silent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. He wondered
whether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty
or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side; together they
gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below. As he
looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching
up for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck him
for the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before occurred to
him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by
childbearing, then hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in the
grain like an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and
after all, he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a block
of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the body
of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why should the fruit be held
inferior to the flower?
'She's beautiful,' he murmured.
'She's a metre across the hips, easily,' said Julia.
'That is her style of beauty,' said Winston.
He held Julia's supple waist easily encircled by his arm. From the hip to
the knee her flank was against his. Out of their bodies no child would
ever come. That was the one thing they could never do. Only by word of
mouth, from mind to mind, could they pass on the secret. The woman down
there had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm heart, and a fertile
belly. He wondered how many children she had given birth to. It might
easily be fifteen. She had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps,
of wild-rose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized
fruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been
laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending,
scrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grandchildren, over
thirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still singing. The mystical
reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of
the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind the chimney-pots into
interminable distance. It was curious to think that the sky was the same
for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people
under the sky were also very much the same--everywhere, all over the world,
hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant
of one another's existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and
yet almost exactly the same--people who had never learned to think but who
were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that
would one day overturn the world. If there was hope, it lay in the proles!
Without having read to the end of THE BOOK, he knew that that must be
Goldstein's final message. The future belonged to the proles. And could he
be sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not be
just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the Party? Yes,
because at the least it would be a world of sanity. Where there is
equality there can be sanity. Sooner or later it would happen, strength
would change into consciousness. The proles were immortal, you could not
doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end
their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a
thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds,
passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share
and could not kill.
'Do you remember,' he said, 'the thrush that sang to us, that first day,
at the edge of the wood?'
'He wasn't singing to us,' said Julia. 'He was singing to please himself.
Not even that. He was just singing.'
The birds sang, the proles sang. the Party did not sing. All round the
world, in London and New York, in Africa and Brazil, and in the mysterious,
forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin,
in the villages of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China and
Japan--everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure, made monstrous
by work and childbearing, toiling from birth to death and still singing.
Out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come.
You were the dead, theirs was the future. But you could share in that
future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body, and passed
on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four.
'We are the dead,' he said.
'We are the dead,' echoed Julia dutifully.
'You are the dead,' said an iron voice behind them.
They sprang apart. Winston's entrails seemed to have turned into ice. He
could see the white all round the irises of Julia's eyes. Her face had
turned a milky yellow. The smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone
stood out sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.
'You are the dead,' repeated the iron voice.
'It was behind the picture,' breathed Julia.
'It was behind the picture,' said the voice. 'Remain exactly where you
are. Make no movement until you are ordered.'
It was starting, it was starting at last! They could do nothing except
stand gazing into one another's eyes. To run for life, to get out of the
house before it was too late--no such thought occurred to them. Unthinkable
to disobey the iron voice from the wall. There was a snap as though a catch
had been turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. The picture had fallen
to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it.
'Now they can see us,' said Julia.
'Now we can see you,' said the voice. 'Stand out in the middle of the
room. Stand back to back. Clasp your hands behind your heads. Do not touch
one another.'
They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel Julia's
body shaking. Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own. He could
just stop his teeth from chattering, but his knees were beyond his control.
There was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside.
The yard seemed to be full of men. Something was being dragged across the
stones. The woman's singing had stopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling
clang, as though the washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a
confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.
'The house is surrounded,' said Winston.
'The house is surrounded,' said the voice.
He heard Julia snap her teeth together. 'I suppose we may as well say
good-bye,' she said.
'You may as well say good-bye,' said the voice. And then another quite
different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which Winston had the impression
of having heard before, struck in; 'And by the way, while we are on the
subject, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to
chop off your head"!'
Something crashed on to the bed behind Winston's back. The head of a ladder
had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame. Someone was
climbing through the window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs.
The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots on
their feet and truncheons in their hands.
Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he barely moved. One
thing alone mattered; to keep still, to keep still and not give them an
excuse to hit you! A man with a smooth prize-fighter's jowl in which the
mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon
meditatively between thumb and forefinger. Winston met his eyes. The
feeling of nakedness, with one's hands behind one's head and one's face
and body all exposed, was almost unbearable. The man protruded the tip
of a white tongue, licked the place where his lips should have been, and
then passed on. There was another crash. Someone had picked up the glass
paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearth-stone.
The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from
a cake, rolled across the mat. How small, thought Winston, how small it
always was! There was a gasp and a thump behind him, and he received a
violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One of
the men had smashed his fist into Julia's solar plexus, doubling her up
like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the floor, fighting for
breath. Winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre, but sometimes
her livid, gasping face came within the angle of his vision. Even in his
terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly
pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her
breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which was
there all the while but could not be suffered yet, because before all else
it was necessary to be able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her
up by knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a sack.
Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with
the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that
was the last he saw of her.
He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts which came of their
own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his
mind. He wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington. He wondered what
they had done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly wanted
to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or
three hours ago. He noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine,
meaning twenty-one. But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light
be fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening? He wondered whether
after all he and Julia had mistaken the time--had slept the clock round
and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty
on the following morning. But he did not pursue the thought further.
It was not interesting.
There was another, lighter step in the passage. Mr Charrington came into
the room. The demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more
subdued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington's appearance. His
eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.
'Pick up those pieces,' he said sharply.
A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disappeared; Winston suddenly
realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the
telescreen. Mr Charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but
his hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was not
wearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp glance, as though
verifying his identity, and then paid no more attention to him. He was
still recognizable, but he was not the same person any longer. His body
had straightened, and seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergone
only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation.
The black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the whole
lines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It
was the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It occurred to
Winston that for the first time in his life he was looking, with knowledge,
at a member of the Thought Police.
PART THREE
Chapter 1
He did not know where he was. Presumably he was in the Ministry of Love,
but there was no way of making certain. He was in a high-ceilinged
windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps
flooded it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound
which he supposed had something to do with the air supply. A bench, or
shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken only by the
door and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden
seat. There were four telescreens, one in each wall.
There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever since they
had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. But he was also
hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four
hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know,
probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when
they arrested him. Since he was arrested he had not been fed.
He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossed
on his knee. He had already learned to sit still. If you made unexpected
movements they yelled at you from the telescreen. But the craving for food
was growing upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread.
He had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his
overalls. It was even possible--he thought this because from time to time
something seemed to tickle his leg--that there might be a sizeable bit of
crust there. In the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he
slipped a hand into his pocket.
'Smith!' yelled a voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.! Hands out of
pockets in the cells!'
He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Before being brought
here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary
prison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols. He did not know how
long he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no
daylight it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smelling
place. They had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in,
but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people. The
majority of them were common criminals, but there were a few political
prisoners among them. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirty
bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much
interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing difference
in demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others. The Party
prisoners were always silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals
seemed to care nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards,
fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscene
words on the floor, ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious
hiding-places in their clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when
it tried to restore order. On the other hand some of them seemed to be on
good terms with the guards, called them by nicknames, and tried to wheedle
cigarettes through the spyhole in the door. The guards, too, treated the
common criminals with a certain forbearance, even when they had to handle
them roughly. There was much talk about the forced-labour camps to which
most of the prisoners expected to be sent. It was 'all right' in the
camps, he gathered, so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes.
There was bribery, favouritism, and racketeering of every kind, there was
homosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit alcohol distilled
from potatoes. The positions of trust were given only to the common
criminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sort
of aristocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.
There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every description:
drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers, drunks, prostitutes.
Some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine
to suppress them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, with
great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down
in her struggles, was carried in, kicking and shouting, by four guards,
who had hold of her one at each corner. They wrenched off the boots with
which she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down across
Winston's lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones. The woman hoisted herself
upright and followed them out with a yell of 'F---- bastards!' Then,
noticing that she was sitting on something uneven, she slid off Winston's
knees on to the bench.
'Beg pardon, dearie,' she said. 'I wouldn't 'a sat on you, only the buggers
put me there. They dono 'ow to treat a lady, do they?' She paused, patted
her breast, and belched. 'Pardon,' she said, 'I ain't meself, quite.'
She leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor.
'Thass better,' she said, leaning back with closed eyes. 'Never keep it
down, thass what I say. Get it up while it's fresh on your stomach, like.'
She revived, turned to have another look at Winston and seemed immediately
to take a fancy to him. She put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew him
towards her, breathing beer and vomit into his face.
'Wass your name, dearie?' she said.
'Smith,' said Winston.
'Smith?' said the woman. 'Thass funny. My name's Smith too. Why,' she
added sentimentally, 'I might be your mother!'
She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was about the right age and
physique, and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty
years in a forced-labour camp.
No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent the ordinary
criminals ignored the Party prisoners. 'The polITS,' they called them,
with a sort of uninterested contempt. The Party prisoners seemed terrified
of speaking to anybody, and above all of speaking to one another. Only
once, when two Party members, both women, were pressed close together on
the bench, he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedly-whispered
words; and in particular a reference to something called 'room one-oh-one',
which he did not understand.
It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here. The
dull pain in his belly never went away, but sometimes it grew better and
sometimes worse, and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. When
it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for
food. When it grew better, panic took hold of him. There were moments
when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality
that his heart galloped and his breath stopped. He felt the smash of
truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself
grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken teeth. He
hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his mind on her. He loved her
and would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew the
rules of arithmetic. He felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered
what was happening to her. He thought oftener of O'Brien, with a flickering
hope. O'Brien might know that he had been arrested. The Brotherhood, he
had said, never tried to save its members. But there was the razor blade;
they would send the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps five
seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The blade would bite
into him with a sort of burning coldness, and even the fingers that held
it would be cut to the bone. Everything came back to his sick body, which
shrank trembling from the smallest pain. He was not certain that he would
use the razor blade even if he got the chance. It was more natural to exist
from moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes' life even with the
certainty that there was torture at the end of it.
Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the
walls of the cell. It should have been easy, but he always lost count at
some point or another. More often he wondered where he was, and what time
of day it was. At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight
outside, and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In
this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out.
It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why O'Brien had seemed to
recognize the allusion. In the Ministry of Love there were no windows. His
cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it
might be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved himself
mentally from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his
body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground.
There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel door opened with
a clang. A young officer, a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed to
glitter all over with polished leather, and whose pale, straight-featured
face was like a wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned
to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. The
poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. The door clanged shut again.
Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side, as
though having some idea that there was another door to go out of, and then
began to wander up and down the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston's
presence. His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above
the level of Winston's head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes were
sticking out of the holes in his socks. He was also several days away
from a shave. A scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones, giving
him an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame and
nervous movements.
Winston roused himself a little from his lethargy. He must speak
to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen. It was even
conceivable that Ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade.
'Ampleforth,' he said.
There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth paused, mildly startled.
His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.
'Ah, Smith!' he said. 'You too!'
'What are you in for?'
'To tell you the truth--' He sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite
Winston. 'There is only one offence, is there not?' he said.
'And have you committed it?'
'Apparently I have.'
He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment, as
though trying to remember something.
'These things happen,' he began vaguely. 'I have been able to recall one
instance--a possible instance. It was an indiscretion, undoubtedly. We
were producing a definitive edition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the
word "God" to remain at the end of a line. I could not help it!' he added
almost indignantly, raising his face to look at Winston. 'It was impossible
to change the line. The rhyme was "rod". Do you realize that there are only
twelve rhymes to "rod" in the entire language? For days I had racked my
brains. There WAS no other rhyme.'
The expression on his face changed. The annoyance passed out of it and for
a moment he looked almost pleased. A sort of intellectual warmth, the joy
of the pedant who has found out some useless fact, shone through the dirt
and scrubby hair.
'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said, 'that the whole history of English
poetry has been determined by the fact that the English language lacks
rhymes?'
No, that particular thought had never occurred to Winston. Nor, in the
circumstances, did it strike him as very important or interesting.
'Do you know what time of day it is?' he said.
Ampleforth looked startled again. 'I had hardly thought about it. They
arrested me--it could be two days ago--perhaps three.' His eyes flitted
round the walls, as though he half expected to find a window somewhere.
'There is no difference between night and day in this place. I do not see
how one can calculate the time.'
They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason,
a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. Winston sat quietly, his
hands crossed. Ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrow
bench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one
knee, then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to keep still.
Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour--it was difficult to judge. Once more
there was a sound of boots outside. Winston's entrails contracted. Soon,
very soon, perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots would
mean that his own turn had come.
The door opened. The cold-faced young officer stepped into the cell. With
a brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth.
'Room 101,' he said.
Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, his face vaguely
perturbed, but uncomprehending.
What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Winston's belly had
revived. His mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball
falling again and again into the same series of slots. He had only six
thoughts. The pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the
screaming; O'Brien; Julia; the razor blade. There was another spasm in his
entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. As the door opened, the wave
of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. Parsons
walked into the cell. He was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.
This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.
'YOU here!' he said.
Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor
surprise, but only misery. He began walking jerkily up and down, evidently
unable to keep still. Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was
apparent that they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring look,
as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in the
middle distance.
'What are you in for?' said Winston.
'Thoughtcrime!' said Parsons, almost blubbering. The tone of his voice
implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous
horror that such a word could be applied to himself. He paused opposite
Winston and began eagerly appealing to him: 'You don't think they'll shoot
me, do you, old chap? They don't shoot you if you haven't actually done
anything--only thoughts, which you can't help? I know they give you a fair
hearing. Oh, I trust them for that! They'll know my record, won't they?
YOU know what kind of chap I was. Not a bad chap in my way. Not brainy, of
course, but keen. I tried to do my best for the Party, didn't I? I'll get
off with five years, don't you think? Or even ten years? A chap like me
could make himself pretty useful in a labour-camp. They wouldn't shoot me
for going off the rails just once?'
'Are you guilty?' said Winston.
'Of course I'm guilty!' cried Parsons with a servile glance at the
telescreen. 'You don't think the Party would arrest an innocent man,
do you?' His frog-like face grew calmer, and even took on a slightly
sanctimonious expression. 'Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,'
he said sententiously. 'It's insidious. It can get hold of you without
your even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my sleep! Yes,
that's a fact. There I was, working away, trying to do my bit--never knew
I had any bad stuff in my mind at all. And then I started talking in my
sleep. Do you know what they heard me saying?'
He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to
utter an obscenity.
'"Down with Big Brother!" Yes, I said that! Said it over and over again,
it seems. Between you and me, old man, I'm glad they got me before it went
any further. Do you know what I'm going to say to them when I go up before
the tribunal? "Thank you," I'm going to say, "thank you for saving me
before it was too late."'
'Who denounced you?' said Winston.
'It was my little daughter,' said Parsons with a sort of doleful pride.
'She listened at the keyhole. Heard what I was saying, and nipped off to
the patrols the very next day. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?
I don't bear her any grudge for it. In fact I'm proud of her. It shows I
brought her up in the right spirit, anyway.'
He made a few more jerky movements up and down, several times, casting a
longing glance at the lavatory pan. Then he suddenly ripped down his
shorts.
'Excuse me, old man,' he said. 'I can't help it. It's the waiting.'
He plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan. Winston covered his
face with his hands.
'Smith!' yelled the voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.! Uncover your
face. No faces covered in the cells.'
Winston uncovered his face. Parsons used the lavatory, loudly and
abundantly. It then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell
stank abominably for hours afterwards.
Parsons was removed. More prisoners came and went, mysteriously. One, a
woman, was consigned to 'Room 101', and, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel
and turn a different colour when she heard the words. A time came when, if
it had been morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or if
it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight. There were six prisoners
in the cell, men and women. All sat very still. Opposite Winston there sat
a man with a chinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large,
harmless rodent. His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom
that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food
tucked away there. His pale-grey eyes flitted timorously from face to face
and turned quickly away again when he caught anyone's eye.
The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent
a momentary chill through Winston. He was a commonplace, mean-looking man
who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind. But what was
startling was the emaciation of his face. It was like a skull. Because of
its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large, and the
eyes seemed filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or
something.
The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from Winston. Winston
did not look at him again, but the tormented, skull-like face was as
vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes.
Suddenly he realized what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation.
The same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the
cell. There was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench. The
eyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skull-faced man, then
turning guiltily away, then being dragged back by an irresistible
attraction. Presently he began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood up,
waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his overalls,
and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread to the
skull-faced man.
There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen. The chinless man
jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man had quickly thrust his hands
behind his back, as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused
the gift.
'Bumstead!' roared the voice. '2713 Bumstead J.! Let fall that piece of
bread!'
The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor.
'Remain standing where you are,' said the voice. 'Face the door. Make no
movement.'
The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy cheeks were quivering
uncontrollably. The door clanged open. As the young officer entered and
stepped aside, there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with
enormous arms and shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chinless man,
and then, at a signal from the officer, let free a frightful blow, with
all the weight of his body behind it, full in the chinless man's mouth.
The force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor. His body
was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory
seat. For a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood oozing from
his mouth and nose. A very faint whimpering or squeaking, which seemed
unconscious, came out of him. Then he rolled over and raised himself
unsteadily on hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the two
halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.
The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their knees. The
chinless man climbed back into his place. Down one side of his face the
flesh was darkening. His mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured
mass with a black hole in the middle of it.
From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls.
His grey eyes still flitted from face to face, more guiltily than ever,
as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for
his humiliation.
The door opened. With a small gesture the officer indicated the
skull-faced man.
'Room 101,' he said.
There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston's side. The man had actually
flung himself on his knees on the floor, with his hand clasped together.
'Comrade! Officer!' he cried. 'You don't have to take me to that place!
Haven't I told you everything already? What else is it you want to know?
There's nothing I wouldn't confess, nothing! Just tell me what it is and
I'll confess straight off. Write it down and I'll sign it--anything!
Not room 101!'
'Room 101,' said the officer.
The man's face, already very pale, turned a colour Winston would not have
believed possible. It was definitely, unmistakably, a shade of green.
'Do anything to me!' he yelled. 'You've been starving me for weeks. Finish
it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-five
years. Is there somebody else you want me to give away? Just say who it is
and I'll tell you anything you want. I don't care who it is or what you do
to them. I've got a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn't six
years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in
front of my eyes, and I'll stand by and watch it. But not Room 101!'
'Room 101,' said the officer.
The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners, as though with
some idea that he could put another victim in his own place. His eyes
settled on the smashed face of the chinless man. He flung out a lean arm.
'That's the one you ought to be taking, not me!' he shouted. 'You didn't
hear what he was saying after they bashed his face. Give me a chance and
I'll tell you every word of it. HE'S the one that's against the Party, not
me.' The guards stepped forward. The man's voice rose to a shriek. 'You
didn't hear him!' he repeated. 'Something went wrong with the telescreen.
HE'S the one you want. Take him, not me!'
The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms. But just at
this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one
of the iron legs that supported the bench. He had set up a wordless
howling, like an animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose,
but he clung on with astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty seconds
they were hauling at him. The prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed on
their knees, looking straight in front of them. The howling stopped; the
man had no breath left for anything except hanging on. Then there was a
different kind of cry. A kick from a guard's boot had broken the fingers
of one of his hands. They dragged him to his feet.
'Room 101,' said the officer.
The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing his
crushed hand, all the fight had gone out of him.
A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the skull-faced man was
taken away, it was morning: if morning, it was afternoon. Winston was
alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow
bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the
telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had
dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it,
but presently hunger gave way to thirst. His mouth was sticky and
evil-tasting. The humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a
sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would get up
because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit
down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of
staying on his feet. Whenever his physical sensations were a little under
control the terror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of
O'Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor blade might
arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought
of Julia. Somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he.
She might be screaming with pain at this moment. He thought: 'If I could
save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I would.' But that
was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought
to take it. He did not feel it. In this place you could not feel anything,
except pain and foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible, when you
were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own pain
should increase? But that question was not answerable yet.
The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O'Brien came in.
Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all
caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the
presence of the telescreen.
'They've got you too!' he cried.
'They got me a long time ago,' said O'Brien with a mild, almost regretful
irony. He stepped aside. From behind him there emerged a broad-chested
guard with a long black truncheon in his hand.
'You know this, Winston,' said O'Brien. 'Don't deceive yourself. You did
know it--you have always known it.'
Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no time to think of
that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard's hand. It might
fall anywhere; on the crown, on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on
the elbow----
The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost paralysed, clasping the
stricken elbow with his other hand. Everything had exploded into yellow
light. Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain!
The light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him. The
guard was laughing at his contortions. One question at any rate was
answered. Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase
of pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop.
Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain
there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he writhed
on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm.
Chapter 2
He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it was
higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he
could not move. Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his
face. O'Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. At
the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic
syringe.
Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually.
He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite
different world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. How long he
had been down there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested
him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his memories were not
continuous. There had been times when consciousness, even the sort of
consciousness that one has in sleep, had stopped dead and started again
after a blank interval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks
or only seconds, there was no way of knowing.
With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started. Later he was
to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routine
interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a
long range of crimes--espionage, sabotage, and the like--to which everyone
had to confess as a matter of course. The confession was a formality,
though the torture was real. How many times he had been beaten, how long
the beatings had continued, he could not remember. Always there were five
or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes it was
fists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimes
it was boots. There were times when he rolled about the floor, as shameless
as an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless
effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet more kicks,
in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin,
in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine. There were times
when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed
to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not
force himself into losing consciousness. There were times when his nerve
so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating
began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough
to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There
were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing
nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of
pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he
said to himself: 'I will confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the
pain becomes unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I will
tell them what they want.' Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly
stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell,
left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again.
There were also longer periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly,
because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor. He remembered a cell
with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tin
wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee. He
remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair,
and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse,
tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers over
him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles into his arm to make
him sleep.
The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror
to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were
unsatisfactory. His questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms
but Party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and
flashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which
lasted--he thought, he could not be sure--ten or twelve hours at a stretch.
These other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain, but
it was not chiefly pain that they relied on. They slapped his face, wrung
his ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to
urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water;
but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of
arguing and reasoning. Their real weapon was the merciless questioning
that went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for
him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of
lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as
from nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a
single session. Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened
at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes
they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in
the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even
now he had not enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to
undo the evil he had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours of
questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears. In the
end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and
fists of the guards. He became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that
signed, whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was to find out
what they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before the
bullying started anew. He confessed to the assassination of eminent Party
members, the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public
funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He confessed that
he had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as
1968. He confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer of
capitalism, and a sexual pervert. He confessed that he had murdered his
wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wife
was still alive. He confessed that for years he had been in personal touch
with Goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which
had included almost every human being he had ever known. It was easier to
confess everything and implicate everybody. Besides, in a sense it was all
true. It was true that he had been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes
of the Party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed.
There were also memories of another kind. They stood out in his mind
disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.
He was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because he
could see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near at hand some kind of
instrument was ticking slowly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more
luminous. Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and
was swallowed up.
He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights.
A man in a white coat was reading the dials. There was a tramp of heavy
boots outside. The door clanged open. The waxed-faced officer marched in,
followed by two guards.
'Room 101,' said the officer.
The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not look at Winston
either; he was looking only at the dials.
He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious,
golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the
top of his voice. He was confessing everything, even the things he had
succeeded in holding back under the torture. He was relating the entire
history of his life to an audience who knew it already. With him were the
guards, the other questioners, the men in white coats, O'Brien, Julia,
Mr Charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with
laughter. Some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had
somehow been skipped over and had not happened. Everything was all right,
there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare,
understood, forgiven.
He was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had
heard O'Brien's voice. All through his interrogation, although he had
never seen him, he had had the feeling that O'Brien was at his elbow, just
out of sight. It was O'Brien who was directing everything. It was he who
set the guards on to Winston and who prevented them from killing him. It
was he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he should
have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the
drugs should be pumped into his arm. It was he who asked the questions and
suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was
the inquisitor, he was the friend. And once--Winston could not remember
whether it was in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment
of wakefulness--a voice murmured in his ear: 'Don't worry, Winston; you
are in my keeping. For seven years I have watched over you. Now the
turning-point has come. I shall save you, I shall make you perfect.' He
was not sure whether it was O'Brien's voice; but it was the same voice
that had said to him, 'We shall meet in the place where there is no
darkness,' in that other dream, seven years ago.
He did not remember any ending to his interrogation. There was a period of
blackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had gradually
materialized round him. He was almost flat on his back, and unable to move.
His body was held down at every essential point. Even the back of his head
was gripped in some manner. O'Brien was looking down at him gravely and
rather sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn, with
pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older
than Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty. Under
his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round
the face.
'I told you,' said O'Brien, 'that if we met again it would be here.'
'Yes,' said Winston.
Without any warning except a slight movement of O'Brien's hand, a wave of
pain flooded his body. It was a frightening pain, because he could not see
what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was
being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening,
or whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was being
wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. Although
the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was
the fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his teeth and
breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible.
'You are afraid,' said O'Brien, watching his face, 'that in another moment
something is going to break. Your especial fear is that it will be your
backbone. You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart
and the spinal fluid dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking,
is it not, Winston?'
Winston did not answer. O'Brien drew back the lever on the dial. The wave
of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come.
'That was forty,' said O'Brien. 'You can see that the numbers on this dial
run up to a hundred. Will you please remember, throughout our conversation,
that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to
whatever degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt to
prevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual level of
intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you understand
that?'
'Yes,' said Winston.
O'Brien's manner became less severe. He resettled his spectacles
thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and down. When he spoke his voice
was gentle and patient. He had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a
priest, anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish.
'I am taking trouble with you, Winston,' he said, 'because you are worth
trouble. You know perfectly well what is the matter with you. You have
known it for years, though you have fought against the knowledge. You are
mentally deranged. You suffer from a defective memory. You are unable to
remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other
events which never happened. Fortunately it is curable. You have never
cured yourself of it, because you did not choose to. There was a small
effort of the will that you were not ready to make. Even now, I am well
aware, you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it is
a virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment, which power is
Oceania at war with?'
'When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.'
'With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia,
has it not?'
Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to speak and then did not
speak. He could not take his eyes away from the dial.
'The truth, please, Winston. YOUR truth. Tell me what you think you
remember.'
'I remember that until only a week before I was arrested, we were not at
war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance with them. The war was
against Eurasia. That had lasted for four years. Before that----'
O'Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.
'Another example,' he said. 'Some years ago you had a very serious delusion
indeed. You believed that three men, three one-time Party members named
Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--men who were executed for treachery and
sabotage after making the fullest possible confession--were not guilty of
the crimes they were charged with. You believed that you had seen
unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were
false. There was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination.
You believed that you had actually held it in your hands. It was a
photograph something like this.'
An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien's fingers. For
perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of Winston's vision. It was
a photograph, and there was no question of its identity. It was THE
photograph. It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, and
Rutherford at the party function in New York, which he had chanced upon
eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. For only an instant it was before
his eyes, then it was out of sight again. But he had seen it,
unquestionably he had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to
wrench the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so much as
a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he had even forgotten the
dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at
least to see it.
'It exists!' he cried.
'No,' said O'Brien.
He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole in the opposite wall.
O'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling
away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame.
O'Brien turned away from the wall.
'Ashes,' he said. 'Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It does not exist.
It never existed.'
'But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it.
You remember it.'
'I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.
Winston's heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a feeling of deadly
helplessness. If he could have been certain that O'Brien was lying, it
would not have seemed to matter. But it was perfectly possible that O'Brien
had really forgotten the photograph. And if so, then already he would have
forgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of
forgetting. How could one be sure that it was simple trickery? Perhaps
that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the
thought that defeated him.
O'Brien was looking down at him speculatively. More than ever he had the
air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child.
'There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of the past,' he said.
'Repeat it, if you please.'
'"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present
controls the past,"' repeated Winston obediently.
'"Who controls the present controls the past,"' said O'Brien, nodding his
head with slow approval. 'Is it your opinion, Winston, that the past has
real existence?'
Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston. His eyes flitted
towards the dial. He not only did not know whether 'yes' or 'no' was the
answer that would save him from pain; he did not even know which answer he
believed to be the true one.
O'Brien smiled faintly. 'You are no metaphysician, Winston,' he said.
'Until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. I
will put it more precisely. Does the past exist concretely, in space? Is
there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past
is still happening?'
'No.'
'Then where does the past exist, if at all?'
'In records. It is written down.'
'In records. And----?'
'In the mind. In human memories.'
'In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all records, and we
control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?'
'But how can you stop people remembering things?' cried Winston again
momentarily forgetting the dial. 'It is involuntary. It is outside oneself.
How can you control memory? You have not controlled mine!'
O'Brien's manner grew stern again. He laid his hand on the dial.
'On the contrary,' he said, 'YOU have not controlled it. That is what has
brought you here. You are here because you have failed in humility, in
self-discipline. You would not make the act of submission which is the
price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only the
disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality is
something objective, external, existing in its own right. You also believe
that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself into
thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the
same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external.
Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual
mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the
mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party
holds to be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except by
looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that you have got
to relearn, Winston. It needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the
will. You must humble yourself before you can become sane.'
He paused for a few moments, as though to allow what he had been saying to
sink in.
'Do you remember,' he went on, 'writing in your diary, "Freedom is the
freedom to say that two plus two make four"?'
'Yes,' said Winston.
O'Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumb
hidden and the four fingers extended.
'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?'
'Four.'
'And if the party says that it is not four but five--then how many?'
'Four.'
The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial had shot up to
fifty-five. The sweat had sprung out all over Winston's body. The air tore
into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his
teeth he could not stop. O'Brien watched him, the four fingers still
extended. He drew back the lever. This time the pain was only slightly
eased.
'How many fingers, Winston?'
'Four.'
The needle went up to sixty.
'How many fingers, Winston?'
'Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!'
The needle must have risen again, but he did not look at it. The heavy,
stern face and the four fingers filled his vision. The fingers stood up
before his eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate,
but unmistakably four.
'How many fingers, Winston?'
'Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!'
'How many fingers, Winston?'
'Five! Five! Five!'
'No, Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still think there are
four. How many fingers, please?'
'Four! five! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop the pain!'
Abruptly he was sitting up with O'Brien's arm round his shoulders. He had
perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. The bonds that had held his
body down were loosened. He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably,
his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. For a
moment he clung to O'Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy
arm round his shoulders. He had the feeling that O'Brien was his protector,
that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source,
and that it was O'Brien who would save him from it.
'You are a slow learner, Winston,' said O'Brien gently.
'How can I help it?' he blubbered. 'How can I help seeing what is in front
of my eyes? Two and two are four.'
'Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three.
Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not
easy to become sane.'
He laid Winston down on the bed. The grip of his limbs tightened again,
but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving him
merely weak and cold. O'Brien motioned with his head to the man in the
white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. The man in
the white coat bent down and looked closely into Winston's eyes, felt his
pulse, laid an ear against his chest, tapped here and there, then he
nodded to O'Brien.
'Again,' said O'Brien.
The pain flowed into Winston's body. The needle must be at seventy,
seventy-five. He had shut his eyes this time. He knew that the fingers
were still there, and still four. All that mattered was somehow to stay
alive until the spasm was over. He had ceased to notice whether he was
crying out or not. The pain lessened again. He opened his eyes. O'Brien
had drawn back the lever.
'How many fingers, Winston?'
'Four. I suppose there are four. I would see five if I could. I am trying
to see five.'
'Which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or really to see
them?'
'Really to see them.'
'Again,' said O'Brien.
Perhaps the needle was eighty--ninety. Winston could not intermittently
remember why the pain was happening. Behind his screwed-up eyelids a
forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and
out, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again. He was trying
to count them, he could not remember why. He knew only that it was
impossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the mysterious
identity between five and four. The pain died down again. When he opened
his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing.
Innumerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streaming past in
either direction, crossing and recrossing. He shut his eyes again.
'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?'
'I don't know. I don't know. You will kill me if you do that again. Four,
five, six--in all honesty I don't know.'
'Better,' said O'Brien.
A needle slid into Winston's arm. Almost in the same instant a blissful,
healing warmth spread all through his body. The pain was already
half-forgotten. He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O'Brien.
At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart
seemed to turn over. If he could have moved he would have stretched out
a hand and laid it on O'Brien's arm. He had never loved him so deeply as
at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain. The old
feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether O'Brien was a friend
or an enemy, had come back. O'Brien was a person who could be talked to.
Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. O'Brien
had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was
certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference. In some
sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere or
other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place
where they could meet and talk. O'Brien was looking down at him with an
expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind.
When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.
'Do you know where you are, Winston?' he said.
'I don't know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.'
'Do you know how long you have been here?'
'I don't know. Days, weeks, months--I think it is months.'
'And why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?'
'To make them confess.'
'No, that is not the reason. Try again.'
'To punish them.'
'No!' exclaimed O'Brien. His voice had changed extraordinarily, and his
face had suddenly become both stern and animated. 'No! Not merely to
extract your confession, not to punish you. Shall I tell you why we have
brought you here? To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand,
Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands
uncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have
committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is
all we care about. We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them.
Do you understand what I mean by that?'
He was bending over Winston. His face looked enormous because of its
nearness, and hideously ugly because it was seen from below. Moreover it
was filled with a sort of exaltation, a lunatic intensity. Again Winston's
heart shrank. If it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into
the bed. He felt certain that O'Brien was about to twist the dial out of
sheer wantonness. At this moment, however, O'Brien turned away. He took a
pace or two up and down. Then he continued less vehemently:
'The first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no
martyrdoms. You have read of the religious persecutions of the past. In
the Middle Ages there was the Inquisition. It was a failure. It set out
to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it
burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Because
the Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them while
they were still unrepentant: in fact, it killed them because they were
unrepentant. Men were dying because they would not abandon their true
beliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame
to the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, there
were the totalitarians, as they were called. There were the German Nazis
and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more cruelly
than the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that they had learned
from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not
make martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they
deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them down
by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches,
confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with
abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy.
And yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again.
The dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Once
again, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that they
had made were obviously extorted and untrue. We do not make mistakes of
that kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are true. We make
them true. And above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us.
You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Winston.
Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out from the
stream of history. We shall turn you into gas and pour you into the
stratosphere. Nothing will remain of you, not a name in a register, not
a memory in a living brain. You will be annihilated in the past as well
as in the future. You will never have existed.'
Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a momentary
bitterness. O'Brien checked his step as though Winston had uttered the
thought aloud. His large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little
narrowed.
'You are thinking,' he said, 'that since we intend to destroy you utterly,
so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference--in
that case, why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first? That is
what you were thinking, was it not?'
'Yes,' said Winston.
O'Brien smiled slightly. 'You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You are
a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell you just now that we are
different from the persecutors of the past? We are not content with
negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission. When finally
you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will. We do not destroy
the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we never
destroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him.
We burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our
side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one of
ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that an erroneous
thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless
it may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation. In
the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming
his heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges could
carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage
waiting for the bullet. But we make the brain perfect before we blow it
out. The command of the old despotisms was "Thou shalt not". The command
of the totalitarians was "Thou shalt". Our command is "THOU ART". No one
whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed
clean. Even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once
believed--Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--in the end we broke them down.
I took part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down,
whimpering, grovelling, weeping--and in the end it was not with pain or
fear, only with penitence. By the time we had finished with them they were
only the shells of men. There was nothing left in them except sorrow for
what they had done, and love of Big Brother. It was touching to see
how they loved him. They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die
while their minds were still clean.'
His voice had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm,
was still in his face. He is not pretending, thought Winston, he is not a
hypocrite, he believes every word he says. What most oppressed him was the
consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. He watched the heavy
yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range of his
vision. O'Brien was a being in all ways larger than himself. There was no
idea that he had ever had, or could have, that O'Brien had not long ago
known, examined, and rejected. His mind CONTAINED Winston's mind. But
in that case how could it be true that O'Brien was mad? It must be he,
Winston, who was mad. O'Brien halted and looked down at him. His voice had
grown stern again.
'Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, however completely
you surrender to us. No one who has once gone astray is ever spared. And
even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life, still
you would never escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever.
Understand that in advance. We shall crush you down to the point from
which there is no coming back. Things will happen to you from which you
could not recover, if you lived a thousand years. Never again will you be
capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you.
Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living,
or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow.
We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.'
He paused and signed to the man in the white coat. Winston was aware of
some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head.
O'Brien had sat down beside the bed, so that his face was almost on a
level with Winston's.
'Three thousand,' he said, speaking over Winston's head to the man in the
white coat.
Two soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped themselves against
Winston's temples. He quailed. There was pain coming, a new kind of pain.
O'Brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.
'This time it will not hurt,' he said. 'Keep your eyes fixed on mine.'
At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what seemed like an
explosion, though it was not certain whether there was any noise. There
was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light. Winston was not hurt, only
prostrated. Although he had already been lying on his back when the thing
happened, he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that
position. A terrific painless blow had flattened him out. Also something
had happened inside his head. As his eyes regained their focus he
remembered who he was, and where he was, and recognized the face that was
gazing into his own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of
emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his brain.
'It will not last,' said O'Brien. 'Look me in the eyes. What country is
Oceania at war with?'
Winston thought. He knew what was meant by Oceania and that he himself was
a citizen of Oceania. He also remembered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who was
at war with whom he did not know. In fact he had not been aware that there
was any war.
'I don't remember.'
'Oceania is at war with Eastasia. Do you remember that now?'
'Yes.'
'Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Since the beginning of your
life, since the beginning of the Party, since the beginning of history,
the war has continued without a break, always the same war. Do you
remember that?'
'Yes.'
'Eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been
condemned to death for treachery. You pretended that you had seen a piece
of paper which proved them innocent. No such piece of paper ever existed.
You invented it, and later you grew to believe in it. You remember now the
very moment at which you first invented it. Do you remember that?'
'Yes.'
'Just now I held up the fingers of my hand to you. You saw five fingers.
Do you remember that?'
'Yes.'
O'Brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with the thumb concealed.
'There are five fingers there. Do you see five fingers?'
'Yes.'
And he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before the scenery of his
mind changed. He saw five fingers, and there was no deformity. Then
everything was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and the
bewilderment came crowding back again. But there had been a moment--he did
not know how long, thirty seconds, perhaps--of luminous certainty, when
each new suggestion of O'Brien's had filled up a patch of emptiness and
become absolute truth, and when two and two could have been three as
easily as five, if that were what was needed. It had faded but before
O'Brien had dropped his hand; but though he could not recapture it, he
could remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience at some period of
one's life when one was in effect a different person.
'You see now,' said O'Brien, 'that it is at any rate possible.'
'Yes,' said Winston.
O'Brien stood up with a satisfied air. Over to his left Winston saw the
man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a
syringe. O'Brien turned to Winston with a smile. In almost the old manner
he resettled his spectacles on his nose.
'Do you remember writing in your diary,' he said, 'that it did not matter
whether I was a friend or an enemy, since I was at least a person who
understood you and could be talked to? You were right. I enjoy talking to
you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you
happen to be insane. Before we bring the session to an end you can ask me
a few questions, if you choose.'
'Any question I like?'
'Anything.' He saw that Winston's eyes were upon the dial. 'It is switched
off. What is your first question?'
'What have you done with Julia?' said Winston.
O'Brien smiled again. 'She betrayed you, Winston. Immediately--unreservedly.
I have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly. You would hardly
recognize her if you saw her. All her rebelliousness, her deceit, her
folly, her dirty-mindedness--everything has been burned out of her. It was
a perfect conversion, a textbook case.'
'You tortured her?'
O'Brien left this unanswered. 'Next question,' he said.
'Does Big Brother exist?'
'Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is the embodiment of
the Party.'
'Does he exist in the same way as I exist?'
'You do not exist,' said O'Brien.
Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. He knew, or he could
imagine, the arguments which proved his own nonexistence; but they were
nonsense, they were only a play on words. Did not the statement, 'You do
not exist', contain a logical absurdity? But what use was it to say so?
His mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments with
which O'Brien would demolish him.
'I think I exist,' he said wearily. 'I am conscious of my own identity.
I was born and I shall die. I have arms and legs. I occupy a particular
point in space. No other solid object can occupy the same point
simultaneously. In that sense, does Big Brother exist?'
'It is of no importance. He exists.'
'Will Big Brother ever die?'
'Of course not. How could he die? Next question.'
'Does the Brotherhood exist?'
'That, Winston, you will never know. If we choose to set you free when we
have finished with you, and if you live to be ninety years old, still you
will never learn whether the answer to that question is Yes or No. As long
as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.'
Winston lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster. He still had
not asked the question that had come into his mind the first. He had got
to ask it, and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it. There
was a trace of amusement in O'Brien's face. Even his spectacles seemed to
wear an ironical gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly, he knows what
I am going to ask! At the thought the words burst out of him:
'What is in Room 101?'
The expression on O'Brien's face did not change. He answered drily:
'You know what is in Room 101, Winston. Everyone knows what is in
Room 101.'
He raised a finger to the man in the white coat. Evidently the session was
at an end. A needle jerked into Winston's arm. He sank almost instantly
into deep sleep.
Chapter 3
'There are three stages in your reintegration,' said O'Brien. 'There is
learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance. It is time for
you to enter upon the second stage.'
As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late his bonds were
looser. They still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees a
little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from
the elbow. The dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He could
evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when he
showed stupidity that O'Brien pulled the lever. Sometimes they got through
a whole session without use of the dial. He could not remember how many
sessions there had been. The whole process seemed to stretch out over a
long, indefinite time--weeks, possibly--and the intervals between the
sessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two.
'As you lie there,' said O'Brien, 'you have often wondered--you have even
asked me--why the Ministry of Love should expend so much time and trouble
on you. And when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially
the same question. You could grasp the mechanics of the Society you lived
in, but not its underlying motives. Do you remember writing in your diary,
"I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY"? It was when you thought about
"why" that you doubted your own sanity. You have read THE BOOK,
Goldstein's book, or parts of it, at least. Did it tell you anything that
you did not know already?'
'You have read it?' said Winston.
'I wrote it. That is to say, I collaborated in writing it. No book is
produced individually, as you know.'
'Is it true, what it says?'
'As description, yes. The programme it sets forth is nonsense. The secret
accumulation of knowledge--a gradual spread of enlightenment--ultimately
a proletarian rebellion--the overthrow of the Party. You foresaw yourself
that that was what it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians will
never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I do
not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have ever
cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. There
is no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is
for ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.'
He came closer to the bed. 'For ever!' he repeated. 'And now let us get
back to the question of "how" and "why". You understand well enough HOW
the Party maintains itself in power. Now tell me WHY we cling to power.
What is our motive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak,' he added as
Winston remained silent.
Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two. A feeling of
weariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come
back into O'Brien's face. He knew in advance what O'Brien would say. That
the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of
the majority. That it sought power because men in the mass were frail,
cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and
must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger
than themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and
happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better.
That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect
doing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of
others. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing was that
when O'Brien said this he would believe it. You could see it in his face.
O'Brien knew everything. A thousand times better than Winston he knew what
the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings
lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept them there. He had
understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was
justified by the ultimate purpose. What can you do, thought Winston,
against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your
arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?
'You are ruling over us for our own good,' he said feebly. 'You believe
that human beings are not fit to govern themselves, and therefore----'
He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shot through his body.
O'Brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five.
'That was stupid, Winston, stupid!' he said. 'You should know better than
to say a thing like that.'
He pulled the lever back and continued:
'Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party
seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good
of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long
life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will
understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the
past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who
resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the
Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never
had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps
they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a
limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where
human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that
no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is
not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order
to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish
the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of
torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to
understand me?'
Winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the tiredness of
O'Brien's face. It was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was full of
intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself
helpless; but it was tired. There were pouches under the eyes, the skin
sagged from the cheekbones. O'Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing
the worn face nearer.
'You are thinking,' he said, 'that my face is old and tired. You are
thinking that I talk of power, and yet I am not even able to prevent the
decay of my own body. Can you not understand, Winston, that the individual
is only a cell? The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism.
Do you die when you cut your fingernails?'
He turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again, one hand
in his pocket.
'We are the priests of power,' he said. 'God is power. But at present
power is only a word so far as you are concerned. It is time for you to
gather some idea of what power means. The first thing you must realize
is that power is collective. The individual only has power in so far as
he ceases to be an individual. You know the Party slogan: "Freedom is
Slavery". Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery is
freedom. Alone--free--the human being is always defeated. It must be so,
because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all
failures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape
from his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he IS the
Party, then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for you to
realize is that power is power over human beings. Over the body--but, above
all, over the mind. Power over matter--external reality, as you would call
it--is not important. Already our control over matter is absolute.'
For a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a violent effort to raise
himself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching his
body painfully.
'But how can you control matter?' he burst out. 'You don't even control
the climate or the law of gravity. And there are disease, pain, death----'
O'Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. 'We control matter because
we control the mind. Reality is inside the skull. You will learn by
degrees, Winston. There is nothing that we could not do. Invisibility,
levitation--anything. I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if
I wish to. I do not wish to, because the Party does not wish it. You must
get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature. We
make the laws of Nature.'
'But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. What about
Eurasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered them yet.'
'Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. And if we did not,
what difference would it make? We can shut them out of existence. Oceania
is the world.'
'But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is tiny--helpless!
How long has he been in existence? For millions of years the earth was
uninhabited.'
'Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older?
Nothing exists except through human consciousness.'
'But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals--mammoths and
mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever
heard of.'
'Have you ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not. Nineteenth-century
biologists invented them. Before man there was nothing. After man, if he
could come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man there is
nothing.'
'But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars! Some of them are
a million light-years away. They are out of our reach for ever.'
'What are the stars?' said O'Brien indifferently. 'They are bits of fire
a few kilometres away. We could reach them if we wanted to. Or we could
blot them out. The earth is the centre of the universe. The sun and the
stars go round it.'
Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he did not say
anything. O'Brien continued as though answering a spoken objection:
'For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When we navigate the
ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to
assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions
upon millions of kilometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is
beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be near
or distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose our mathematicians
are unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?'
Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, the swift answer
crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he knew, he KNEW, that he was in the
right. The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind--surely there
must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it not been
exposed long ago as a fallacy? There was even a name for it, which he
had forgotten. A faint smile twitched the corners of O'Brien's mouth as
he looked down at him.
'I told you, Winston,' he said, 'that metaphysics is not your strong
point. The word you are trying to think of is solipsism. But you are
mistaken. This is not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. But
that is a different thing: in fact, the opposite thing. All this is a
digression,' he added in a different tone. 'The real power, the power we
have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men.'
He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster
questioning a promising pupil: 'How does one man assert his power over
another, Winston?'
Winston thought. 'By making him suffer,' he said.
'Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is
suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his
own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing
human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of
your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are
creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that
the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a
world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not
less but MORE merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will
be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they
were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world
there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement.
Everything else we shall destroy--everything. Already we are breaking down
the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We
have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and
between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend
any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends.
Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from
a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual
formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm.
Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except
loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of
Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over
a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When
we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be
no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity,
no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be
destroyed. But always--do not forget this, Winston--always there will be
the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing
subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory,
the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a
picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.'
He paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Winston had tried to
shrink back into the surface of the bed again. He could not say anything.
His heart seemed to be frozen. O'Brien went on:
'And remember that it is for ever. The face will always be there to be
stamped upon. The heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so
that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that you
have undergone since you have been in our hands--all that will continue,
and worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the
executions, the disappearances will never cease. It will be a world of
terror as much as a world of triumph. The more the Party is powerful, the
less it will be tolerant: the weaker the opposition, the tighter the
despotism. Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day, at
every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon and
yet they will always survive. This drama that I have played out with you
during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after
generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here
at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible--and in the end
utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his own
accord. That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world of
victory after victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless
pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning,
I can see, to realize what that world will be like. But in the end you
will do more than understand it. You will accept it, welcome it, become
part of it.'
Winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak. 'You can't!' he said
weakly.
'What do you mean by that remark, Winston?'
'You could not create such a world as you have just described. It is a
dream. It is impossible.'
'Why?'
'It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty.
It would never endure.'
'Why not?'
'It would have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would commit
suicide.'
'Nonsense. You are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting
than love. Why should it be? And if it were, what difference would that
make? Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster. Suppose that we
quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. Still what
difference would it make? Can you not understand that the death of the
individual is not death? The party is immortal.'
As usual, the voice had battered Winston into helplessness. Moreover he
was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement O'Brien would twist
the dial again. And yet he could not keep silent. Feebly, without
arguments, with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of
what O'Brien had said, he returned to the attack.
'I don't know--I don't care. Somehow you will fail. Something will defeat
you. Life will defeat you.'
'We control life, Winston, at all its levels. You are imagining that there
is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and
will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely
malleable. Or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the
proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us. Put it out of your
mind. They are helpless, like the animals. Humanity is the Party. The
others are outside--irrelevant.'
'I don't care. In the end they will beat you. Sooner or later they will
see you for what you are, and then they will tear you to pieces.'
'Do you see any evidence that that is happening? Or any reason why it
should?'
'No. I believe it. I KNOW that you will fail. There is something in the
universe--I don't know, some spirit, some principle--that you will never
overcome.'
'Do you believe in God, Winston?'
'No.'
'Then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?'
'I don't know. The spirit of Man.'
'And do you consider yourself a man?'
'Yes.'
'If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Your kind is extinct; we
are the inheritors. Do you understand that you are ALONE? You are outside
history, you are non-existent.' His manner changed and he said more
harshly: 'And you consider yourself morally superior to us, with our lies
and our cruelty?'
'Yes, I consider myself superior.'
O'Brien did not speak. Two other voices were speaking. After a moment
Winston recognized one of them as his own. It was a sound-track of the
conversation he had had with O'Brien, on the night when he had enrolled
himself in the Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal,
to forge, to murder, to encourage drug-taking and prostitution, to
disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a child's face. O'Brien
made a small impatient gesture, as though to say that the demonstration
was hardly worth making. Then he turned a switch and the voices stopped.
'Get up from that bed,' he said.
The bonds had loosened themselves. Winston lowered himself to the floor
and stood up unsteadily.
'You are the last man,' said O'Brien. 'You are the guardian of the human
spirit. You shall see yourself as you are. Take off your clothes.'
Winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together. The zip
fastener had long since been wrenched out of them. He could not remember
whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at
one time. Beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish
rags, just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As he slid
them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far
end of the room. He approached it, then stopped short. An involuntary cry
had broken out of him.
'Go on,' said O'Brien. 'Stand between the wings of the mirror. You shall
see the side view as well.'
He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, grey-coloured,
skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. Its actual appearance was
frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. He
moved closer to the glass. The creature's face seemed to be protruded,
because of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird's face with a nobby
forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and
battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful.
The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was
his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had
changed inside. The emotions it registered would be different from the
ones he felt. He had gone partially bald. For the first moment he had
thought that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the scalp that was
grey. Except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey all
over with ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt there
were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an
inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly frightening
thing was the emaciation of his body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow
as that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker
than the thighs. He saw now what O'Brien had meant about seeing the side
view. The curvature of the spine was astonishing. The thin shoulders were
hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck
seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess he
would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from
some malignant disease.
'You have thought sometimes,' said O'Brien, 'that my face--the face of a
member of the Inner Party--looks old and worn. What do you think of your
own face?'
He seized Winston's shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him.
'Look at the condition you are in!' he said. 'Look at this filthy grime
all over your body. Look at the dirt between your toes. Look at that
disgusting running sore on your leg. Do you know that you stink like a
goat? Probably you have ceased to notice it. Look at your emaciation. Do
you see? I can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep. I could
snap your neck like a carrot. Do you know that you have lost twenty-five
kilograms since you have been in our hands? Even your hair is coming out
in handfuls. Look!' He plucked at Winston's head and brought away a tuft
of hair. 'Open your mouth. Nine, ten, eleven teeth left. How many had you
when you came to us? And the few you have left are dropping out of your
head. Look here!'
He seized one of Winston's remaining front teeth between his powerful
thumb and forefinger. A twinge of pain shot through Winston's jaw. O'Brien
had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across the
cell.
'You are rotting away,' he said; 'you are falling to pieces. What are you?
A bag of filth. Now turn around and look into that mirror again. Do you
see that thing facing you? That is the last man. If you are human, that is
humanity. Now put your clothes on again.'
Winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements. Until now he had
not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was. Only one thought stirred in
his mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined.
Then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of
pity for his ruined body overcame him. Before he knew what he was doing
he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst
into tears. He was aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of
bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: but
he could not stop himself. O'Brien laid a hand on his shoulder, almost
kindly.
'It will not last for ever,' he said. 'You can escape from it whenever you
choose. Everything depends on yourself.'
'You did it!' sobbed Winston. 'You reduced me to this state.'
'No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what you accepted when
you set yourself up against the Party. It was all contained in that first
act. Nothing has happened that you did not foresee.'
He paused, and then went on:
'We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. You have seen what
your body is like. Your mind is in the same state. I do not think there
can be much pride left in you. You have been kicked and flogged and
insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in
your own blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed
everybody and everything. Can you think of a single degradation that has
not happened to you?'
Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his
eyes. He looked up at O'Brien.
'I have not betrayed Julia,' he said.
O'Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. 'No,' he said; 'no; that is
perfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia.'
The peculiar reverence for O'Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy,
flooded Winston's heart again. How intelligent, he thought, how
intelligent! Never did O'Brien fail to understand what was said to him.
Anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he HAD betrayed
Julia. For what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the
torture? He had told them everything he knew about her, her habits, her
character, her past life; he had confessed in the most trivial detail
everything that had happened at their meetings, all that he had said to
her and she to him, their black-market meals, their adulteries, their
vague plottings against the Party--everything. And yet, in the sense in
which he intended the word, he had not betrayed her. He had not stopped
loving her; his feelings towards her had remained the same. O'Brien had
seen what he meant without the need for explanation.
'Tell me,' he said, 'how soon will they shoot me?'
'It might be a long time,' said O'Brien. 'You are a difficult case. But
don't give up hope. Everyone is cured sooner or later. In the end we shall
shoot you.'
Chapter 4
He was much better. He was growing fatter and stronger every day, if it
was proper to speak of days.
The white light and the humming sound were the same as ever, but the cell
was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in. There was a
pillow and a mattress on the plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They had
given him a bath, and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently
in a tin basin. They even gave him warm water to wash with. They had given
him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls. They had dressed his
varicose ulcer with soothing ointment. They had pulled out the remnants
of his teeth and given him a new set of dentures.
Weeks or months must have passed. It would have been possible now to keep
count of the passage of time, if he had felt any interest in doing so,
since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals. He was
getting, he judged, three meals in the twenty-four hours; sometimes he
wondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day. The food
was surprisingly good, with meat at every third meal. Once there was even
a packet of cigarettes. He had no matches, but the never-speaking guard
who brought his food would give him a light. The first time he tried to
smoke it made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the packet out for
a long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal.
They had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the
corner. At first he made no use of it. Even when he was awake he was
completely torpid. Often he would lie from one meal to the next almost
without stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries
in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes. He had long grown
used to sleeping with a strong light on his face. It seemed to make no
difference, except that one's dreams were more coherent. He dreamed a
great deal all through this time, and they were always happy dreams. He
was in the Golden Country, or he was sitting among enormous glorious,
sunlit ruins, with his mother, with Julia, with O'Brien--not doing
anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things. Such
thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams. He
seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort, now that the
stimulus of pain had been removed. He was not bored, he had no desire
for conversation or distraction. Merely to be alone, not to be beaten
or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was
completely satisfying.
By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no
impulse to get off the bed. All he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the
strength gathering in his body. He would finger himself here and there,
trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were
growing rounder and his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond a
doubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely thicker
than his knees. After that, reluctantly at first, he began exercising
himself regularly. In a little while he could walk three kilometres,
measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growing
straighter. He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and
humiliated to find what things he could not do. He could not move out of a
walk, he could not hold his stool out at arm's length, he could not stand
on one leg without falling over. He squatted down on his heels, and found
that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to
a standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight
by his hands. It was hopeless, he could not raise himself a centimetre.
But after a few more days--a few more mealtimes--even that feat was
accomplished. A time came when he could do it six times running. He began
to grow actually proud of his body, and to cherish an intermittent belief
that his face also was growing back to normal. Only when he chanced to put
his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed, ruined face that
had looked back at him out of the mirror.
His mind grew more active. He sat down on the plank bed, his back against
the wall and the slate on his knees, and set to work deliberately at the
task of re-educating himself.
He had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as he saw now, he had
been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision. From the
moment when he was inside the Ministry of Love--and yes, even during those
minutes when he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the
telescreen told them what to do--he had grasped the frivolity, the
shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the
Party. He knew now that for seven years the Thought Police had watched him
like a beetle under a magnifying glass. There was no physical act, no word
spoken aloud, that they had not noticed, no train of thought that they had
not been able to infer. Even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his
diary they had carefully replaced. They had played sound-tracks to him,
shown him photographs. Some of them were photographs of Julia and himself.
Yes, even... He could not fight against the Party any longer. Besides,
the Party was in the right. It must be so; how could the immortal,
collective brain be mistaken? By what external standard could you check
its judgements? Sanity was statistical. It was merely a question of
learning to think as they thought. Only----!
The pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers. He began to write down
the thoughts that came into his head. He wrote first in large clumsy
capitals:
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it:
TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE
But then there came a sort of check. His mind, as though shying away from
something, seemed unable to concentrate. He knew that he knew what came
next, but for the moment he could not recall it. When he did recall it,
it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be: it did not come
of its own accord. He wrote:
GOD IS POWER
He accepted everything. The past was alterable. The past never had been
altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war
with Eastasia. Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes
they were charged with. He had never seen the photograph that disproved
their guilt. It had never existed, he had invented it. He remembered
remembering contrary things, but those were false memories, products of
self-deception. How easy it all was! Only surrender, and everything else
followed. It was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards
however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to turn round and
go with the current instead of opposing it. Nothing had changed except
your own attitude: the predestined thing happened in any case. He hardly
knew why he had ever rebelled. Everything was easy, except----!
Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature were nonsense. The
law of gravity was nonsense. 'If I wished,' O'Brien had said, 'I could
float off this floor like a soap bubble.' Winston worked it out. 'If he
THINKS he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously THINK I see him
do it, then the thing happens.' Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage
breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: 'It doesn't
really happen. We imagine it. It is hallucination.' He pushed the thought
under instantly. The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere
or other, outside oneself, there was a 'real' world where 'real' things
happened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we of
anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind.
Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.
He had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and he was in no danger
of succumbing to it. He realized, nevertheless, that it ought never to
have occurred to him. The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a
dangerous thought presented itself. The process should be automatic,
instinctive. CRIMESTOP, they called it in Newspeak.
He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He presented himself with
propositions--'the Party says the earth is flat', 'the party says that
ice is heavier than water'--and trained himself in not seeing or not
understanding the arguments that contradicted them. It was not easy.
It needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmetical
problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as 'two and two make
five' were beyond his intellectual grasp. It needed also a sort of
athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicate
use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical
errors. Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to
attain.
All the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how soon they would
shoot him. 'Everything depends on yourself,' O'Brien had said; but he knew
that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer. It
might be ten minutes hence, or ten years. They might keep him for years in
solitary confinement, they might send him to a labour-camp, they might
release him for a while, as they sometimes did. It was perfectly possible
that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation
would be enacted all over again. The one certain thing was that death
never came at an expected moment. The tradition--the unspoken tradition:
somehow you knew it, though you never heard it said--was that they shot
you from behind; always in the back of the head, without warning, as you
walked down a corridor from cell to cell.
One day--but 'one day' was not the right expression; just as probably it
was in the middle of the night: once--he fell into a strange, blissful
reverie. He was walking down the corridor, waiting for the bullet. He knew
that it was coming in another moment. Everything was settled, smoothed
out, reconciled. There were no more doubts, no more arguments, no more
pain, no more fear. His body was healthy and strong. He walked easily,
with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. He was
not any longer in the narrow white corridors in the Ministry of Love, he
was in the enormous sunlit passage, a kilometre wide, down which he had
seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs. He was in the Golden
Country, following the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture.
He could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine
on his face. At the edge of the field were the elm trees, faintly stirring,
and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green
pools under the willows.
Suddenly he started up with a shock of horror. The sweat broke out on his
backbone. He had heard himself cry aloud:
'Julia! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia!'
For a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence. She
had seemed to be not merely with him, but inside him. It was as though she
had got into the texture of his skin. In that moment he had loved her far
more than he had ever done when they were together and free. Also he knew
that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help.
He lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. What had he done? How
many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness?
In another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside. They could not
let such an outburst go unpunished. They would know now, if they had not
known before, that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them.
He obeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old days he had
hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity. Now he had
retreated a step further: in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped
to keep the inner heart inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, but
he preferred to be in the wrong. They would understand that--O'Brien would
understand it. It was all confessed in that single foolish cry.
He would have to start all over again. It might take years. He ran a hand
over his face, trying to familiarize himself with the new shape. There
were deep furrows in the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose
flattened. Besides, since last seeing himself in the glass he had been
given a complete new set of teeth. It was not easy to preserve
inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like. In any
case, mere control of the features was not enough. For the first time he
perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from
yourself. You must know all the while that it is there, but until it is
needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape
that could be given a name. From now onwards he must not only think right;
he must feel right, dream right. And all the while he must keep his hatred
locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and
yet unconnected with the rest of him, a kind of cyst.
One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not tell when it would
happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess. It
was always from behind, walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be
enough. In that time the world inside him could turn over. And then
suddenly, without a word uttered, without a check in his step, without the
changing of a line in his face--suddenly the camouflage would be down and
bang! would go the batteries of his hatred. Hatred would fill him like an
enormous roaring flame. And almost in the same instant bang! would go the
bullet, too late, or too early. They would have blown his brain to pieces
before they could reclaim it. The heretical thought would be unpunished,
unrepented, out of their reach for ever. They would have blown a hole in
their own perfection. To die hating them, that was freedom.
He shut his eyes. It was more difficult than accepting an intellectual
discipline. It was a question of degrading himself, mutilating himself. He
had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth. What was the most horrible,
sickening thing of all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous face
(because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as
being a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that
followed you to and fro, seemed to float into his mind of its own accord.
What were his true feelings towards Big Brother?
There was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. The steel door swung open
with a clang. O'Brien walked into the cell. Behind him were the waxen-faced
officer and the black-uniformed guards.
'Get up,' said O'Brien. 'Come here.'
Winston stood opposite him. O'Brien took Winston's shoulders between his
strong hands and looked at him closely.
'You have had thoughts of deceiving me,' he said. 'That was stupid.
Stand up straighter. Look me in the face.'
He paused, and went on in a gentler tone:
'You are improving. Intellectually there is very little wrong with you.
It is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress. Tell me,
Winston--and remember, no lies: you know that I am always able to detect
a lie--tell me, what are your true feelings towards Big Brother?'
'I hate him.'
'You hate him. Good. Then the time has come for you to take the last step.
You must love Big Brother. It is not enough to obey him: you must love
him.'
He released Winston with a little push towards the guards.
'Room 101,' he said.
Chapter 5
At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed to know,
whereabouts he was in the windowless building. Possibly there were slight
differences in the air pressure. The cells where the guards had beaten him
were below ground level. The room where he had been interrogated by
O'Brien was high up near the roof. This place was many metres underground,
as deep down as it was possible to go.
It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he hardly noticed
his surroundings. All he noticed was that there were two small tables
straight in front of him, each covered with green baize. One was only a
metre or two from him, the other was further away, near the door. He was
strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not
even his head. A sort of pad gripped his head from behind, forcing him to
look straight in front of him.
For a moment he was alone, then the door opened and O'Brien came in.
'You asked me once,' said O'Brien, 'what was in Room 101. I told you that
you knew the answer already. Everyone knows it. The thing that is in
Room 101 is the worst thing in the world.'
The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying something made of wire,
a box or basket of some kind. He set it down on the further table. Because
of the position in which O'Brien was standing. Winston could not see what
the thing was.
'The worst thing in the world,' said O'Brien, 'varies from individual to
individual. It may be burial alive, or death by fire, or by drowning, or
by impalement, or fifty other deaths. There are cases where it is some
quite trivial thing, not even fatal.'
He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a better view of
the thing on the table. It was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top
for carrying it by. Fixed to the front of it was something that looked
like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. Although it was three
or four metres away from him, he could see that the cage was divided
lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind of creature
in each. They were rats.
'In your case,' said O'Brien, 'the worst thing in the world happens to be
rats.'
A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, had
passed through Winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage.
But at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of it
suddenly sank into him. His bowels seemed to turn to water.
'You can't do that!' he cried out in a high cracked voice. 'You couldn't,
you couldn't! It's impossible.'
'Do you remember,' said O'Brien, 'the moment of panic that used to occur
in your dreams? There was a wall of blackness in front of you, and a
roaring sound in your ears. There was something terrible on the other side
of the wall. You knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag it
into the open. It was the rats that were on the other side of the wall.'
'O'Brien!' said Winston, making an effort to control his voice. 'You know
this is not necessary. What is it that you want me to do?'
O'Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish
manner that he sometimes affected. He looked thoughtfully into the
distance, as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind
Winston's back.
'By itself,' he said, 'pain is not always enough. There are occasions when
a human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death.
But for everyone there is something unendurable--something that cannot be
contemplated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you are falling
from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you have come up
from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air. It is
merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. It is the same with the
rats. For you, they are unendurable. They are a form of pressure that you
cannot withstand, even if you wished to. You will do what is required of
you.'
'But what is it, what is it? How can I do it if I don't know what it is?'
O'Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table.
He set it down carefully on the baize cloth. Winston could hear the blood
singing in his ears. He had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness.
He was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with
sunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances.
Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him. They were
enormous rats. They were at the age when a rat's muzzle grows blunt and
fierce and his fur brown instead of grey.
'The rat,' said O'Brien, still addressing his invisible audience,
'although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware of that. You will have
heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town. In some
streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five
minutes. The rats are certain to attack it. Within quite a small time they
will strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or dying people. They
show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless.'
There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed to reach Winston
from far away. The rats were fighting; they were trying to get at each
other through the partition. He heard also a deep groan of despair.
That, too, seemed to come from outside himself.
O'Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed something in it.
There was a sharp click. Winston made a frantic effort to tear himself
loose from the chair. It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head,
was held immovably. O'Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than a
metre from Winston's face.
'I have pressed the first lever,' said O'Brien. 'You understand the
construction of this cage. The mask will fit over your head, leaving no
exit. When I press this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up.
These starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets. Have you ever
seen a rat leap through the air? They will leap on to your face and bore
straight into it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first. Sometimes they
burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue.'
The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a succession of
shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head. But
he fought furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even with a
split second left--to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty
odour of the brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion of
nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Everything had gone
black. For an instant he was insane, a screaming animal. Yet he came out
of the blackness clutching an idea. There was one and only one way to save
himself. He must interpose another human being, the BODY of another human
being, between himself and the rats.
The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of
anything else. The wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face. The
rats knew what was coming now. One of them was leaping up and down, the
other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink
hands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston could see
the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the black panic took hold of him.
He was blind, helpless, mindless.
'It was a common punishment in Imperial China,' said O'Brien as
didactically as ever.
The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his cheek. And then--no,
it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. Too late, perhaps
too late. But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was
just ONE person to whom he could transfer his punishment--ONE body that he
could thrust between himself and the rats. And he was shouting frantically,
over and over.
'Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't care what you do
to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!'
He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. He was
still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor, through
the walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, through
the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars--always
away, away, away from the rats. He was light years distant, but O'Brien
was still standing at his side. There was still the cold touch of wire
against his cheek. But through the darkness that enveloped him he heard
another metallic click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and
not open.
Chapter 6
The Chestnut Tree was almost empty. A ray of sunlight slanting through a
window fell on dusty table-tops. It was the lonely hour of fifteen. A
tinny music trickled from the telescreens.
Winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. Now and again
he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall.
BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came and
filled his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into it a few drops from
another bottle with a quill through the cork. It was saccharine flavoured
with cloves, the speciality of the cafe.
Winston was listening to the telescreen. At present only music was coming
out of it, but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be
a special bulletin from the Ministry of Peace. The news from the African
front was disquieting in the extreme. On and off he had been worrying
about it all day. A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war with Eurasia:
Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia) was moving southward at
terrifying speed. The mid-day bulletin had not mentioned any definite
area, but it was probable that already the mouth of the Congo was a
battlefield. Brazzaville and Leopoldville were in danger. One did not have
to look at the map to see what it meant. It was not merely a question of
losing Central Africa: for the first time in the whole war, the territory
of Oceania itself was menaced.
A violent emotion, not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated
excitement, flared up in him, then faded again. He stopped thinking about
the war. In these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for
more than a few moments at a time. He picked up his glass and drained it
at a gulp. As always, the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly.
The stuff was horrible. The cloves and saccharine, themselves disgusting
enough in their sickly way, could not disguise the flat oily smell; and
what was worst of all was that the smell of gin, which dwelt with him
night and day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of
those----
He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far as it was possible
he never visualized them. They were something that he was half-aware of,
hovering close to his face, a smell that clung to his nostrils. As the gin
rose in him he belched through purple lips. He had grown fatter since they
released him, and had regained his old colour--indeed, more than regained
it. His features had thickened, the skin on nose and cheekbones was
coarsely red, even the bald scalp was too deep a pink. A waiter, again
unbidden, brought the chessboard and the current issue of 'The Times',
with the page turned down at the chess problem. Then, seeing that Winston's
glass was empty, he brought the gin bottle and filled it. There was no
need to give orders. They knew his habits. The chessboard was always
waiting for him, his corner table was always reserved; even when the place
was full he had it to himself, since nobody cared to be seen sitting too
close to him. He never even bothered to count his drinks. At irregular
intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said
was the bill, but he had the impression that they always undercharged him.
It would have made no difference if it had been the other way about. He
had always plenty of money nowadays. He even had a job, a sinecure, more
highly-paid than his old job had been.
The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over. Winston raised
his head to listen. No bulletins from the front, however. It was merely a
brief announcement from the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding quarter,
it appeared, the Tenth Three-Year Plan's quota for bootlaces had been
overfulfilled by 98 per cent.
He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It was a tricky
ending, involving a couple of knights. 'White to play and mate in two
moves.' Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother. White always
mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without
exception, it is so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of
the world has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying
triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calm
power. White always mates.
The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much
graver tone: 'You are warned to stand by for an important announcement at
fifteen-thirty. Fifteen-thirty! This is news of the highest importance.
Take care not to miss it. Fifteen-thirty!' The tinkling music struck up
again.
Winston's heart stirred. That was the bulletin from the front; instinct
told him that it was bad news that was coming. All day, with little spurts
of excitement, the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and
out of his mind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming
across the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africa
like a column of ants. Why had it not been possible to outflank them in
some way? The outline of the West African coast stood out vividly in his
mind. He picked up the white knight and moved it across the board. THERE
was the proper spot. Even while he saw the black horde racing southward he
saw another force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted in their rear,
cutting their communications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it he
was bringing that other force into existence. But it was necessary to act
quickly. If they could get control of the whole of Africa, if they had
airfields and submarine bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in two. It
might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the
destruction of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinary medley
of feeling--but it was not a medley, exactly; rather it was successive
layers of feeling, in which one could not say which layer was
undermost--struggled inside him.
The spasm passed. He put the white knight back in its place, but for the
moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem.
His thoughts wandered again. Almost unconsciously he traced with his
finger in the dust on the table:
2+2=5
'They can't get inside you,' she had said. But they could get inside you.
'What happens to you here is FOR EVER,' O'Brien had said. That was a true
word. There were things, your own acts, from which you could never recover.
Something was killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out.
He had seen her; he had even spoken to her. There was no danger in it. He
knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his
doings. He could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them
had wanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. It was in the
Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth was like iron and
all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few
crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. He
was hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not
ten metres away from him. It struck him at once that she had changed in
some ill-defined way. They almost passed one another without a sign, then
he turned and followed her, not very eagerly. He knew that there was no
danger, nobody would take any interest in him. She did not speak. She
walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him,
then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side. Presently they
were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs, useless either for
concealment or as protection from the wind. They halted. It was vilely
cold. The wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional,
dirty-looking crocuses. He put his arm round her waist.
There was no telescreen, but there must be hidden microphones: besides,
they could be seen. It did not matter, nothing mattered. They could have
lain down on the ground and done THAT if they had wanted to. His flesh
froze with horror at the thought of it. She made no response whatever to
the clasp of his arm; she did not even try to disengage herself. He knew
now what had changed in her. Her face was sallower, and there was a long
scar, partly hidden by the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that
was not the change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a
surprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how once, after the explosion
of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins, and
had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing, but by
its rigidity and awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more like stone
than flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to him that the texture
of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been.
He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As they walked back
across the grass, she looked directly at him for the first time. It
was only a momentary glance, full of contempt and dislike. He wondered
whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it
was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept
squeezing from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, side by side
but not too close together. He saw that she was about to speak. She moved
her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig. Her
feet seemed to have grown broader, he noticed.
'I betrayed you,' she said baldly.
'I betrayed you,' he said.
She gave him another quick look of dislike.
'Sometimes,' she said, 'they threaten you with something something you
can't stand up to, can't even think about. And then you say, "Don't do it
to me, do it to somebody else, do it to so-and-so." And perhaps you might
pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to
make them stop and didn't really mean it. But that isn't true. At the time
when it happens you do mean it. You think there's no other way of saving
yourself, and you're quite ready to save yourself that way. You WANT it to
happen to the other person. You don't give a damn what they suffer. All
you care about is yourself.'
'All you care about is yourself,' he echoed.
'And after that, you don't feel the same towards the other person any
longer.'
'No,' he said, 'you don't feel the same.'
There did not seem to be anything more to say. The wind plastered their
thin overalls against their bodies. Almost at once it became embarrassing
to sit there in silence: besides, it was too cold to keep still. She said
something about catching her Tube and stood up to go.
'We must meet again,' he said.
'Yes,' she said, 'we must meet again.'
He followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace behind her.
They did not speak again. She did not actually try to shake him off, but
walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her.
He had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the Tube
station, but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed
pointless and unbearable. He was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to
get away from Julia as to get back to the Chestnut Tree Cafe, which had
never seemed so attractive as at this moment. He had a nostalgic vision
of his corner table, with the newspaper and the chessboard and the
ever-flowing gin. Above all, it would be warm in there. The next moment,
not altogether by accident, he allowed himself to become separated from
her by a small knot of people. He made a half-hearted attempt to catch up,
then slowed down, turned, and made off in the opposite direction. When he
had gone fifty metres he looked back. The street was not crowded, but
already he could not distinguish her. Any one of a dozen hurrying figures
might have been hers. Perhaps her thickened, stiffened body was no longer
recognizable from behind.
'At the time when it happens,' she had said, 'you do mean it.' He had
meant it. He had not merely said it, he had wished it. He had wished that
she and not he should be delivered over to the----
Something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen. A
cracked and jeering note, a yellow note, came into it. And then--perhaps
it was not happening, perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance
of sound--a voice was singing:
  'Under the spreading chestnut tree
  I sold you and you sold me----'
The tears welled up in his eyes. A passing waiter noticed that his glass
was empty and came back with the gin bottle.
He took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff grew not less but more
horrible with every mouthful he drank. But it had become the element he
swam in. It was his life, his death, and his resurrection. It was gin that
sank him into stupor every night, and gin that revived him every morning.
When he woke, seldom before eleven hundred, with gummed-up eyelids and
fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken, it would have been
impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the
bottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight. Through the midday
hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy, listening to the
telescreen. From fifteen to closing-time he was a fixture in the Chestnut
Tree. No one cared what he did any longer, no whistle woke him, no
telescreen admonished him. Occasionally, perhaps twice a week, he went
to a dusty, forgotten-looking office in the Ministry of Truth and did
a little work, or what was called work. He had been appointed to a
sub-committee of a sub-committee which had sprouted from one of the
innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the
compilation of the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. They were
engaged in producing something called an Interim Report, but what it was
that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out. It was
something to do with the question of whether commas should be placed
inside brackets, or outside. There were four others on the committee, all
of them persons similar to himself. There were days when they assembled
and then promptly dispersed again, frankly admitting to one another that
there was not really anything to be done. But there were other days when
they settled down to their work almost eagerly, making a tremendous show
of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were never
finished--when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing about
grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse, with subtle haggling over
definitions, enormous digressions, quarrels--threats, even, to appeal to
higher authority. And then suddenly the life would go out of them and
they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes,
like ghosts fading at cock-crow.
The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raised his head again. The
bulletin! But no, they were merely changing the music. He had the map of
Africa behind his eyelids. The movement of the armies was a diagram: a
black arrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow horizontally
eastward, across the tail of the first. As though for reassurance he
looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait. Was it conceivable
that the second arrow did not even exist?
His interest flagged again. He drank another mouthful of gin, picked up
the white knight and made a tentative move. Check. But it was evidently
not the right move, because----
Uncalled, a memory floated into his mind. He saw a candle-lit room with a
vast white-counterpaned bed, and himself, a boy of nine or ten, sitting on
the floor, shaking a dice-box, and laughing excitedly. His mother was
sitting opposite him and also laughing.
It must have been about a month before she disappeared. It was a moment of
reconciliation, when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and his
earlier affection for her had temporarily revived. He remembered the day
well, a pelting, drenching day when the water streamed down the window-pane
and the light indoors was too dull to read by. The boredom of the two
children in the dark, cramped bedroom became unbearable. Winston whined
and grizzled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the room pulling
everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours
banged on the wall, while the younger child wailed intermittently. In the
end his mother said, 'Now be good, and I'll buy you a toy. A lovely
toy--you'll love it'; and then she had gone out in the rain, to a little
general shop which was still sporadically open nearby, and came back with
a cardboard box containing an outfit of Snakes and Ladders. He could still
remember the smell of the damp cardboard. It was a miserable outfit. The
board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that they
would hardly lie on their sides. Winston looked at the thing sulkily and
without interest. But then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat
down on the floor to play. Soon he was wildly excited and shouting with
laughter as the tiddly-winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then
came slithering down the snakes again, almost to the starting-point. They
played eight games, winning four each. His tiny sister, too young to
understand what the game was about, had sat propped up against a bolster,
laughing because the others were laughing. For a whole afternoon they had
all been happy together, as in his earlier childhood.
He pushed the picture out of his mind. It was a false memory. He was
troubled by false memories occasionally. They did not matter so long as
one knew them for what they were. Some things had happened, others had not
happened. He turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight
again. Almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a
clatter. He had started as though a pin had run into him.
A shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air. It was the bulletin! Victory!
It always meant victory when a trumpet-call preceded the news. A sort of
electric drill ran through the cafe. Even the waiters had started and
pricked up their ears.
The trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume of noise. Already an
excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen, but even as it started
it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside. The news had
run round the streets like magic. He could hear just enough of what was
issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened, as he had
foreseen; a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in
the enemy's rear, the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black.
Fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din: 'Vast
strategic manoeuvre--perfect co-ordination--utter rout--half a million
prisoners--complete demoralization--control of the whole of Africa--bring
the war within measurable distance of its end--victory--greatest victory
in human history--victory, victory, victory!'
Under the table Winston's feet made convulsive movements. He had not
stirred from his seat, but in his mind he was running, swiftly running,
he was with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf. He looked up again
at the portrait of Big Brother. The colossus that bestrode the world!
The rock against which the hordes of Asia dashed themselves in vain! He
thought how ten minutes ago--yes, only ten minutes--there had still been
equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front
would be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was more than a Eurasian army that
had perished! Much had changed in him since that first day in the Ministry
of Love, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened,
until this moment.
The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners
and booty and slaughter, but the shouting outside had died down a little.
The waiters were turning back to their work. One of them approached with
the gin bottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention
as his glass was filled up. He was not running or cheering any longer. He
was back in the Ministry of Love, with everything forgiven, his soul white
as snow. He was in the public dock, confessing everything, implicating
everybody. He was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with the feeling
of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at his back. The long-hoped-for
bullet was entering his brain.
He gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had taken him to learn
what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache. O cruel, needless
misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast!
Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all
right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won
the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.
THE END
APPENDIX.
The Principles of Newspeak
Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meet
the ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the year 1984
there was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of
communication, either in speech or writing. The leading articles in
'The Times' were written in it, but this was a TOUR DE FORCE which could
only be carried out by a specialist. It was expected that Newspeak would
have finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should
call it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all
Party members tending to use Newspeak words and grammatical constructions
more and more in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984, and
embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was
a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic
formations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the final,
perfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary,
that we are concerned here.
The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression
for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc,
but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that
when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten,
a heretical thought--that is, a thought diverging from the principles of
Ingsoc--should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is
dependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and
often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could
properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the
possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly
by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable
words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and
so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. To give a single
example. The word FREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be
used in such statements as 'This dog is free from lice' or 'This field is
free from weeds'. It could not be used in its old sense of 'politically
free' or 'intellectually free' since political and intellectual freedom no
longer existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless.
Quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction
of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be
dispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend
but to DIMINISH the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly
assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.
Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though
many Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words,
would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak
words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary,
the B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary.
It will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical
peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to
the A vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.
THE A VOCABULARY. The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the
business of everyday life--for such things as eating, drinking, working,
putting on one's clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles,
gardening, cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirely of words
that we already possess words like HIT, RUN, DOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE,
FIELD--but in comparison with the present-day English vocabulary their
number was extremely small, while their meanings were far more rigidly
defined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of
them. So far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this class was
simply a staccato sound expressing ONE clearly understood concept. It
would have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary
purposes or for political or philosophical discussion. It was intended
only to express simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete
objects or physical actions.
The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. The first of
these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of
speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very
abstract words such as IF or WHEN) could be used either as verb, noun,
adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were
of the same root, there was never any variation, this rule of itself
involving the destruction of many archaic forms. The word THOUGHT, for
example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was taken by THINK, which
did duty for both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followed
here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention,
in other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning
were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently
suppressed. There was, for example, no such word as CUT, its meaning being
sufficiently covered by the noun-verb KNIFE. Adjectives were formed by
adding the suffix -FUL to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding -WISE. Thus
for example, SPEEDFUL meant 'rapid' and SPEEDWISE meant 'quickly'. Certain
of our present-day adjectives, such as GOOD, STRONG, BIG, BLACK, SOFT,
were retained, but their total number was very small. There was little
need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by
adding -FUL to a noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs was retained,
except for a very few already ending in -WISE: the -WISE termination was
invariable. The word WELL, for example, was replaced by GOODWISE.
In addition, any word--this again applied in principle to every word in
the language--could be negatived by adding the affix UN-, or could be
strengthened by the affix PLUS-, or, for still greater emphasis,
DOUBLEPLUS-. Thus, for example, UNCOLD meant 'warm', while PLUSCOLD and
DOUBLEPLUSCOLD meant, respectively, 'very cold' and 'superlatively cold'.
It was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of
almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-,
etc. By such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous
diminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, the word GOOD, there was no
need for such a word as BAD, since the required meaning was equally
well--indeed, better--expressed by UNGOOD. All that was necessary, in any
case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide
which of them to suppress. DARK, for example, could be replaced by UNLIGHT,
or LIGHT by UNDARK, according to preference.
The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity.
Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexions
followed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past
participle were the same and ended in -ED. The preterite of STEAL was
STEALED, the preterite of THINK was THINKED, and so on throughout the
language, all such forms as SWAM, GAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc., being
abolished. All plurals were made by adding -S or -ES as the case might be.
The plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES, LIFES. Comparison of
adjectives was invariably made by adding -ER, -EST (GOOD, GOODER, GOODEST),
irregular forms and the MORE, MOST formation being suppressed.
The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly
were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the
auxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except that
WHOM had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the SHALL, SHOULD tenses had
been dropped, all their uses being covered by WILL and WOULD. There were
also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for
rapid and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liable
to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally
therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word
or an archaic formation was retained. But this need made itself felt
chiefly in connexion with the B vocabulary. WHY so great an importance was
attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.
THE B VOCABULARY. The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been
deliberately constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say,
which not only had in every case a political implication, but were intended
to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Without
a full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to use
these words correctly. In some cases they could be translated into
Oldspeak, or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usually
demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain
overtones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing
whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more
accurate and forcible than ordinary language.
The B words were in all cases compound words. [Compound words such as
SPEAKWRITE, were of course to be found in the A vocabulary, but these were
merely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colour.]
They consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together
in an easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was always a
noun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single
example: the word GOODTHINK, meaning, very roughly, 'orthodoxy', or, if
one chose to regard it as a verb, 'to think in an orthodox manner'. This
inflected as follows: noun-verb, GOODTHINK; past tense and past participle,
GOODTHINKED; present participle, GOOD-THINKING; adjective, GOODTHINKFUL;
adverb, GOODTHINKWISE; verbal noun, GOODTHINKER.
The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words of
which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placed
in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce
while indicating their derivation. In the word CRIMETHINK (thoughtcrime),
for instance, the THINK came second, whereas in THINKPOL (Thought Police)
it came first, and in the latter word POLICE had lost its second syllable.
Because of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations
were commoner in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example,
the adjective forms of MINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively,
MINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY, simply because -TRUEFUL,
-PAXFUL, and -LOVEFUL were slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle,
however, all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the
same way.
Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to
anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, for example,
such a typical sentence from a 'Times' leading article as OLDTHINKERS
UNBELLYFEEL INGSOC. The shortest rendering that one could make of this
in Oldspeak would be: 'Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution
cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of English
Socialism.' But this is not an adequate translation. To begin with, in
order to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above,
one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by INGSOC. And in
addition, only a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate
the full force of the word BELLYFEEL, which implied a blind, enthusiastic
acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word OLDTHINK, which was
inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence. But the
special function of certain Newspeak words, of which OLDTHINK was one,
was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. These words,
necessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they
contained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were
sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped
and forgotten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the Newspeak
Dictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make
sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words
they cancelled by their existence.
As we have already seen in the case of the word FREE, words which had
once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of
convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them.
Countless other words such as HONOUR, JUSTICE, MORALITY, INTERNATIONALISM,
DEMOCRACY, SCIENCE, and RELIGION had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket
words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All words
grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for
instance, were contained in the single word CRIMETHINK, while all words
grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism
were contained in the single word OLDTHINK. Greater precision would have
been dangerous. What was required in a Party member was an outlook similar
to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that
all nations other than his own worshipped 'false gods'. He did not need to
know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the
like: probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy.
He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore, that
all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. In somewhat
the same way, the party member knew what constituted right conduct, and in
exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from
it were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by
the two Newspeak words SEXCRIME (sexual immorality) and GOODSEX (chastity).
SEXCRIME covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication,
adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal
intercourse practised for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate
them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle,
all punishable by death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientific
and technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names to
certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had no need of them.
He knew what was meant by GOODSEX--that is to say, normal intercourse
between man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and
without physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was SEXCRIME.
In Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further
than the perception that it WAS heretical: beyond that point the necessary
words were nonexistent.
No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. A great many were
euphemisms. Such words, for instance, as JOYCAMP (forced-labour camp) or
MINIPAX (Ministry of Peace, i.e. Ministry of War) meant almost the exact
opposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other hand,
displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of
Oceanic society. An example was PROLEFEED, meaning the rubbishy
entertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses.
Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation 'good' when
applied to the Party and 'bad' when applied to its enemies. But in
addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared
to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not
from their meaning, but from their structure.
So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have
political significance of any kind was fitted into the B vocabulary. The
name of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or
institution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar
shape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number
of syllables that would preserve the original derivation. In the Ministry
of Truth, for example, the Records Department, in which Winston Smith
worked, was called RECDEP, the Fiction Department was called FICDEP, the
Teleprogrammes Department was called TELEDEP, and so on. This was not
done solely with the object of saving time. Even in the early decades of
the twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the
characteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed
that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in
totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations. Examples were such
words as NAZI, GESTAPO, COMINTERN, INPRECORR, AGITPROP. In the beginning
the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively, but in Newspeak
it was used with a conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus
abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by
cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it.
The words COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL, for instance, call up a composite
picture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, Karl Marx,
and the Paris Commune. The word COMINTERN, on the other hand, suggests
merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine.
It refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited in
purpose, as a chair or a table. COMINTERN is a word that can be uttered
almost without taking thought, whereas COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL is a phrase
over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way,
the associations called up by a word like MINITRUE are fewer and more
controllable than those called up by MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accounted not
only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the
almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily
pronounceable.
In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude
of meaning. Regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it
seemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for
political purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which
could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the
speaker's mind. The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from
the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably
these words--GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED, SEXCRIME, JOYCAMP, INGSOC,
BELLYFEEL, THINKPOL, and countless others--were words of two or three
syllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable
and the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at
once staccato and monotonous. And this was exactly what was aimed at. The
intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not
ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness.
For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes
necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to
make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the
correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets.
His training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost
foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound
and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of
Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.
So did the fact of having very few words to choose from. Relative to our
own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were
constantly being devised. Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all other
languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every
year. Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice,
the smaller the temptation to take thought. Ultimately it was hoped to
make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher
brain centres at all. This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak word
DUCKSPEAK, meaning 'to quack like a duck'. Like various other words in
the B vocabulary, DUCKSPEAK was ambivalent in meaning. Provided that the
opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but
praise, and when 'The Times' referred to one of the orators of the Party
as a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER it was paying a warm and valued compliment.
THE C VOCABULARY. The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and
consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled the
scientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots,
but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of
undesirable meanings. They followed the same grammatical rules as the
words in the other two vocabularies. Very few of the C words had any
currency either in everyday speech or in political speech. Any scientific
worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted
to his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the
words occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words were common to
all lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science
as a habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular
branches. There was, indeed, no word for 'Science', any meaning that it
could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word INGSOC.
From the foregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expression
of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible.
It was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a
species of blasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to say
BIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely
conveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by
reasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. Ideas
inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form,
and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and
condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so.
One could, in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by
illegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For
example, ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only
in the same sense in which ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeak
sentence. It did not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed
a palpable untruth--i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, or
strength. The concept of political equality no longer existed, and this
secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word EQUAL.
In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication,
the danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might
remember their original meanings. In practice it was not difficult for
any person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK to avoid doing this, but within
a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have
vanished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no
more know that EQUAL had once had the secondary meaning of 'politically
equal', or that FREE had once meant 'intellectually free', than for
instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the
secondary meanings attaching to QUEEN and ROOK. There would be many
crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit, simply
because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to be
foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics
of Newspeak would become more and more pronounced--its words growing
fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of
putting them to improper uses always diminishing.
When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with
the past would have been severed. History had already been rewritten,
but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there,
imperfectly censored, and so long as one retained one's knowledge of
Oldspeak it was possible to read them. In the future such fragments, even
if they chanced to survive, would be unintelligible and untranslatable.
It was impossible to translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless
it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday
action, or was already orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL would be the Newspeak
expression) in tendency. In practice this meant that no book written before
approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole. Pre-revolutionary
literature could only be subjected to ideological translation--that is,
alteration in sense as well as language. Take for example the well-known
passage from the Declaration of Independence:
WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL,
THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS,
THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.
THAT TO SECURE THESE RIGHTS, GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN,
DERIVING THEIR POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED. THAT WHENEVER
ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THOSE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT
OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT...
It would have been quite impossible to render this into Newspeak while
keeping to the sense of the original. The nearest one could come to doing
so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word CRIMETHINK.
A full translation could only be an ideological translation, whereby
Jefferson's words would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government.
A good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, already being
transformed in this way. Considerations of prestige made it desirable to
preserve the memory of certain historical figures, while at the same time
bringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc.
Various writers, such as Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Byron, Dickens, and
some others were therefore in process of translation: when the task had
been completed, their original writings, with all else that survived of
the literature of the past, would be destroyed. These translations were
a slow and difficult business, and it was not expected that they would
be finished before the first or second decade of the twenty-first
century. There were also large quantities of merely utilitarian
literature--indispensable technical manuals, and the like--that had to
be treated in the same way. It was chiefly in order to allow time for
the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of Newspeak
had been fixed for so late a date as 2050.

Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.
The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.
The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.

when i try to speculate about ark lore i help myself with rain world lore and oneshot lore

do you think
retard the cat
secretly ships zelda and mitsy
holy shit stop
stop fucking telling zelda anything
look for it yourself
it should be in the mitsy shithole

makoto would be dead either way
i havent finished p5r yet is this canon
WHAT THE FUCK???

MAGNUS???
awwww ty
did u see the fanmade kotone opening
its peak
"money cant buy happiness" mfs when they learn of male prostitutes in an adachi cosplay:
idfk what taht is
was sae adachis sugar mommy?
thats where the faggot lives
architecthor
zelda would crashout but
thats literally what i would do
especially the "WHAT IS THIS??"
doesnt this look FIRE
he overdosed on element (an alien material with insane properties) to ascend but instead of becoming one of the evolved ascended humans who live outside space and probably time too  but instead became trapped in the programming of a failing ark forever stuck as the guardian of it (the boss survivors need to defeat to ascend) putting him in an infinite loop of death forever
help
i tried putting both my official atlus adachi dildos up my ass at the same time and theyre stuck
it feels like my rectum is gonna implode
you hate ark right?
lets try this to see if ark is peak or slop

TAMING???
ALSO ANY DINOSAURS??
ANY RIDEABLE SHIT??
GRINDING LEVELS?
RNG IN CREATURE LEVELS?
ok bosses
are there bosses you have to grind a ton for
oh its not an arklike
boring
slop
with that lore i wouldve thought its actually good but no
is it at least mainly focus on survival
and purely survival
ark is a fabricated ecosystem
these are the arks
this is where the final boss is
therye called overseers
theyre there on every map
on the current map im playing the survivors somehow destroyed that area and it killed the dome around it and now during days the surface is so hot that its an instakill if you go there
the surface is also full of "reapers"
anything as cool as this in rw?
show me some creative insane rw designs
ive already seen echos and their designs are insanely good
what the fuck
ii mean
according to my theory which is probably true
earth SEVERELY fucked up and humans went extinct
then weird ais took dna of humans from all time periods and put them on these space stations to survive and adapt and at some point get sent to back to earth to rescue it from idfk what
same for the evolved humans imp retty sure
thats not official name official name is prob better
all the ark lore i yap up is schizo theories
(i dont spoil myself on peak)
do you wanna know what i get whats at this point probably 100 hours of schizophrenia theorycrafting from?
Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.
The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.
The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.
Cause and effect is the way of the universe. Everything must start somewhere. In the case of the System, this is where it was born. You will fall right into its cradle.
Together, the sanctuaries and the Obelisks that power them are the ancestor of every island that floats in the sky. They can all can trace their origins back to this single prototype. Though it is flightless, the core principles and technology behind it are the same.
In a way, that makes it your ancestor too. You were all born within the System, after all. Even if your design is somewhat altered, in a way, you're all its children.
One could say that when you fall, it will be something of a homecoming. In more ways than one.
these 2 things
thats all
this is by what i presume to be the evolved human version of the main character (not the playable character the dossiers writer)
ark has the same thing
via explorer notes
one of the evolved humans has explorer notes on the first 2 maps so definitely on the third one too
and their shit all points to the 4th and most important map extinction
one of the notes on map 2 was for aberration the third map tho
system born = earth
fall = go from the arks in space to earth
sanctuaries = the city and the 2 prototype hot and cold arks
ancestors = as i said prototype arks 
flightless = very early stages of the arks shit as the island extinction note says so theyre on the ground as domes 
your ancestor = humanity extinct as evident by the hologram model of earth being completely fucked
born within the system = humanity extinct and its just dna of random people across earth from all timeframes being uploaded to whatever the fuck the system is 
design altered = survivors are literally DATA that can be uploaded and the implants presumably have it all stored but theyre still humans and have human dna
when you fall = sent to extinction aka earth 
homecoming more ways than one = both humans SOMEHOW repopulating a destroyed earth (the main thing i havent figured out yet) and the system is presumably hosted on earth so both the humanity and the ark tech fuckery return to earth and the prototype arks
if there was a physical copy of ark
actually it probably exists
i would fuck it
i wanna nut on this
tell zelda this is his favorite place
show me a band luh nigga
@Pixel im crying for peak fiction
ITS HATCHING PIXEL ITS HATCHING
holy shit
the sound of the acs in ark block it out in the medal clip but
the fucking music sync was insane with the rock drake hatching
floch
rock drake yippie :DDDD - Clipped with Medal.tv
Watch rock drake yippie :DDDD and millions of other ARK: Survival Evolved videos on Medal, the largest Game Clip Platform.
im quitting again
would rather play hk
oh thats not my main one
the main one was invisible because ark is ark
i had a fucking mental breakdown and five stages of grief because of an invisibility bug
@Pixel
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
MY RNG IS SO INSANE
DADDY IS HERE
ark lore got real dark just now
"persona"
what the fuck???
no??
no zelda
???
edit this into sukuna
zelda WILL kill himself
ok
what is that name
hes like 40 so its fine
but someone thats 16-18 (zelda) wearing that to class would just be self humiliation
fine outfit for going out in the city tho
beards really age up people huh
i have sex with hitler and sex with hitler 2 on my other steam
friend gifted me a while ago
never touched them
do you think silver has a robotic 28 inch strapon
her ass is NOT aigis
wrong person
whatas the setting of rw
is it like a planet or wha
how long have the iterators and ancients and echos been arou7nd for
how much am i missing from only buying rw not downpour
i dont buy shit if there isnt a discount
this is pretty attractive
only 30% tho
also whats the new dlc after downpour gonna be about
i just checked you
dont evne have rw in ur libary
how did he of all people get it
i wanna see the pt
only 131h???
not even all achiv??
ark all achivs makes zeor sense and its only on first map
you can choose to ascend on gamma, beta or alpha and alpha is the hardest one
and theres achievements for each ascension
but if you do alpha you dont get the achievements for gamma and beta.
(the only difference is gamma gives 5 levels, beta 10 levels and alpha 15 levels)
also this that nobody does
and this requires you to beat every map and grind for hundreds of hours after
its stupid.
any spoilers or dcan i watch
how hard is the gameplay btw
of rw
is it scorched earth level (dying 45 times in the first 10 minutes and over 200 times in first few hours)
do you keep inventory and shit
after death
oh ok great no loss
btw
can u savescum.
WHAT
anyway i assume
rw is like surface runs
u do shit, explore then need to get the fuck underground or under cover before you get burned alive
wym
can you technically pirate it
great
can i use pirated downpour with steam rw
so i went on reddit
to read about rw lore specifically ascension and void fluid
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE
explain everything about void worms thanks
i cant understand how they live in the literal void sea
what are they truly
how could something live in the void and live off the void tho
are they fully biological or what
how is it possible
that void worms dont dissolve
oh that makes sense
when the void worm pulls u in its probably to the very bottom
and no matter how deep it looks until that point
the void worms are prob at the surface level still
those are other slugcats ascending no?
or perceived as
why can you eat neurons of an iterator
arent both 5p and lttm malfunctioning
where is she then
GG
the oen that hasnt released?
calls himself the lore expert 💀
huh
oh
whyd u say it is released then
are you stupid?
what is it then
is this alr released
whats it called
explain
wym
oh is that its name
my favorite ark writer
isnt it non canon
????????????????????????
which ending is the best
what
dont you ascend in most
whats outer expanse
whats scavenger king
which campaign for first playthrough
how does a slugcat turn into that
why do most slugcats not try to ascend
oh
can all of them ascend
do any become echos
or can only ancients become echos
oh
why btw
why does saint become an echo then
hwat
why
and how
how can a slugcat ascend others
huh what the fuck happens after that
why acn he
btw what happened to the ancients who didnt ascend
did they just leave earth or
how did they all ascend tho
wouldnt there be way more echos if they all ascended
or is there just a ton of echos in the world that u cant access
why were iterators not able to ascend btw
like why didnt ancients design them so they could ascend after they all left
ye ik
but the structures are massive
can u visit the cities on top of the superstructures
whats in the city
is "james primate" a black man
aw
whats a scavenger btw
in lore
WHAT
why
why
fair enough
how acn you fuck up your reputatio ntho
how do u get rep
they seem useufl
also does everything reset after a cycle
why not
how long in a cycle before it starts raining
is there n ocap
can ite ven start like 10 mins in
and how long do u have toe scape
so u have only 13 mins to explore around??
how common are shelters
oh ok
why btw
do you kill him w that
also wouldnt cycles completely stop happening
if 5p and lttm die
yea but isnt it mainly 5p's issue
for the water usage
?
didnt he use the most
by far
to kil lhimself
what
no
im sane
i dont play persona
or listen to persona
also
do i play rw or er first
once i finish this ark map its effectively over for my ark career
the next 2 and last maps arent designed to be beaten solo
so i cant
play ark anymore
is it a short game
if u do only one or two campaigns
well for er i plan to play it like ark
100% all endings all achivs a ton of grinding
are there any sloppy ones
ark has some sloppy maps
whats the chronological order
why did your retarded brother add me
isnt survivor the first one in rw huh
spearmaster is the one with the discord gc logs right
@Pixel
oh that will be a great first one then
how long to finish every campaign
i am not doing the dating sim one btw
wym
oh that one
achiv?
useless then
how long to do every campaign in hours aproximately
why 80 for the first wtf
im not that bad at videogames
i beat scorched a really hard map very fast

.
im just curious about how degen you too are
lmao
hey pixel yk that atrocious memories of ark edit i made after finishing p3r
few days after i started playing the slop again
what a horrible fucking decision!
how finished is p3r kotone mod i need p3r content
when i finish portal 2 what should i play
geno ut?
what exactly do i have to kill for it
all unique monsters and all bosses?
@Pixel is there a mouse or at least wasd undertale mod
undyne doesnt look IMPOSSIBLY hard ill be fine with a few hours or days
the yellow arrows are concerning tho
kinda boring tho
oh do i do that after pacifist
ill just rs and do pacifist
ur a gooner 💀
mementos isnt in p3
and does she use it on yukari or makoto
if were being realistic here mitsuru would make an ice dildo and use it on you
wym
that sentence makes zero sense
also ben is the nazi not me
im german not austrian
pixel when archipelago
is your cuck boyfriend still gooning to towny
i wanna play ocarina of time
zeldqa
@Pixel do you find this cute
whats that a reference to
what
pixel its a robot
kill yourself
ur black lolll
memories of utter slop
ghost msg
im going to rape you, pixel
so will be your cheeks
wait what the fuck is your display name nigger
LMFAOOO
us :3
NEAND JUST DMD ME
KYS
@Pixel
oh yea what do those words mean even
heat supressants alpha omega
@Pixel he didnt explain shit
you explain
that doesnt mean anything
oh i looked it up
its mpreg gay fanfiction.
i never wanted to grab a knife i swear
i want you to wear a femboy mitsuru cosplay and sit on my face
did you know maruki was freaky like that?
i go on okbp like once a month when im reminded it exists by you
and god are there some BANGERS
its weird how theres actually good palace shadow designs (maruki) and utter slop palace shadow designs (kamoshida, madarame, kaneshiro)
should i actually finish it after portal 2 and genocide route
i think i need a long long break from ark
do you know why i enjoyed utter slop when i got back into it november? because i havent played it for 2.5 months and missed it
maybe i can actually sorta like the final 2 slop dlcs if i dont play ark for 4+ months beforehand
aberration is peak video game and everything else fucking sucks
actually hm debateable
p3r had a good ending aberration got a bit boring towards the end and the bossfight was a buggy mess the final cinematic was insane tho
even if p3r is better its still up there
is it better than p3 ending
idk if ill ever play a better game than p3
which characters ending
when i finished p3r i immediately went to sleep so i wouldnt cry
it worked but i still woke up depressed
it was like 4 am too lol
oh i watched the base game ascension already its like an acid trip
i also watched a 1h 30 video essay on rw once
how long without sleep
only 12h?
long periods without sleep fuck up your brain
i thought a small shark at an austrian terrarium house thingy was the weirdest shit known to man when i was on 30h+ no sleep
which is the best ending in rw
which route
and should i do my first playthrough without rw
theyre all good??????????????????????
impossible
ark: releases 4 slop maps, releases peak fiction, releases 7 more slop maps
good as in good writing or good outcome
i know saint becomes an echo
and artificer becomes an echo
unfun?
greed.....
PIXEL WHAT THE FUCK????????????????????????????????????????????????
RW STEAM KEYS ARE 4$

racist
how many
thats not that much but isnt us dollars banned in egypt.
is it like oneshot/undertale
what makes it unique
the character u sent whos that
kys
stupid?
also are you adding a good villai
honestly i like it most when a villain isnt some cartoonishly evil or tragic backstory but just someone with not inherently bad actions that are opposite to the protagonist's
yes i know the term is antagonist not villain but smd
oh are you making that type of villain
like mahito and barem
where you just utterly fucking DESPISE
make him more hateable than barem
@Pixel i know how much you hate ark
BUT WHY THE FUCK IS IT SPRAYING MILS OUT OF TITS FROM THE SIDE OF ITS BODY
its just an INSANELY weird ark creature
one of the devs got their fetish made into a creature i guess?
how big plot twist are we talking
are you doing that lmao
at least make them appear more throughout the story
kinda like flowey does
whats his name
whats the setting of the game
PIXELATED
FACE
I REJOINED KUUDRA GANG
AND A STAFF GUY HAS THIS IN STATUS
IT ARE SO OVER
idk what it is
OK SO HEAR ME OUT
UNDERTALE START IS AN AOT REFERENCE
ILL EXPLAIN IT ALL WHEN YOU WAKE UP
is that even a woman pixel
will
@Pixel
how do u notice the least significant thing first
wait u should put smt like that in ur game
wonder of u
what else retard
wtf u mean 7 souls
yea undertale sub but didnt know what it meant
anyway undertale is attack on titan 1:1
- chara/frisk/whatever the fuck is the real name falls into the tree which is an entire new world and power presumably because other humans were not the nicest to them
- commits genocide by infleuncing/manipulating another abused human
huhhh
who the fuck is frisk then
ohhhh
so chara uses frisk as a vessel to genocide
by influencing frisk
actual aot reference....
yea yea same in aot its the mcs decision to genocide the long dead morally grey child with insane powers only helps
asriel is flowey right
chara killed themselves with those flowers intentionally right
~~elden ring miquella reference~~
did you ever beat sans, pixel?
how many people even have
the final attack
is geometry dash
i could never get past the final attack
why would you not
new content!
should i play uty when i finish geno in 55 years
whats her name
wym
no pixel you saw it
its just the same image
that i used for faking looking at shuake r34
if youre that curious
just
saw?
who is clover
the bird?
thats fine then if clover isnt the bird
thats a male child not an adult bird woman
👎👎👎👎👎
hey pixel yk that bird balls gif
is there any birds with huge balls in uty
pixel lets esex in kuudra gang im bored
why not
what point
oh yea i read that
ut has 93 endings.
which are actually relevant and in what order
im gonna redo the entire game soon
ye ik but thats still MENTAL
how much of a diff is soullest pacifist an 2nd geno
should i stop watching ark videos and watch the 3h all ut endings video
I HAVE CANCER
107 osts
how much effort went into uty.
how long did base ut take
how many endings
wtf would flawed pacifist be
oh is it mostly new charcaters
how many returning characters
which
when is it set
does chara never appear
whos main villain
oh does he take your soul
in all ending?
so you spare everyone to kill yourself
show
also isnt flowey asriel
WTF IS THAT
wait has anyone done geno no hit
ut
is she geno final boss
can you not spare JUST her
WHYYY
LMAO

do you think haru hatepegs akechi
but akechi secretly enjoys it
wait i jus realized
mitsuru is not a dommy mommy at all
in her sl she isnt dominant in the slightest
wait is kawakami actually submissive tho
thats heart shattering
i wanted her to be a dommy mommy who pegs jonkler for bad grades and shit
NAHHHHH
THIS IS JUST EVIL
japan has emo twink strip clubs?????

@Pixel since youre probably malnourished due to being egyptian
do you have a feminine body?

@Pixel @Pixel @Pixel @Pixel
DIE
no
youre an actual gooner
NVM I WANT IT NOW
SEND ME
send
WHY NOT
ITS PORN???
why are we watching porn mr pixelated face
DIE
with who
are you
in drone posting yet
can u do a eldritch design for it
pleas
na
what
no
so is he miserablus about it
PLEASE dont make it a goth twink but an actual eldritch monster
i hate when designs of cool concepts get reduced to tumblr twinks
"god of death and damnation" and his design is this
ok hear me out on this one
make it A FUCKTON of arms
and make the arms and then his head be this cross shape all together
and kinda hunched back with the coffin strapped to his back
also incorporate elements of white not just black
make his skin pure white
and dont make his head some emo shti make it some eldritch shit
youre so unoriginal
go for an uncanny valley feel
like 3-4m tall and his limbs humanoid but weirder
make some of his arms 4 or 6 fingers
make them long and slender but still thicker than the average person's
and make his head a complete anomaly maybe something thatd be like a cross
basically like fiends in csm
where they have some shit bashed into their head
do this melded thing into human head thing
but make it a white or black cross
and itd go through the head and end with the chin
where itd go down from would be like a bullet wound from behind in the head
huh
wait this would be
so good
because you could have the hair go upwards like hair would be if youre laying down in a coffin from the back
like where the coffin is
are you going for a general vibe of him being dead
wait i just realized.
this is a pixelated game
most of the shit i mentione
would only work with a high res most likely 3d design
ok you could go with this
vibe of life on him but vibe of death on his outfit
@Pixel what kind of personality are you going for for him btw?
i have an idea but explain the personality first
is he good or bad
does he wish for death
yea thats what i meant
you could go for the rarely seen approach of death
where its just someone guiding the dead towards their end
and also if you have any characters dying
make foreshadowing with him
make interesting interactions
where he doesnt explicitly say it
but it subtly shows in his sprites and dialogue that someone is near their end
oh boring i had this entire idea
make it someone whos just compassionate and kind and wants to guide souls to a (probably) walmart rw ascension without confusion so they safely reach their destination
an interesting trait would be an interaction with someone not ready to die yet and despite him probably seeing a case like that many times still feeling bad about it
@Pixel PLEASE make a sea of souls
that could be so good in a 2d pixel game
and a sick ass pale canoe
and he just talks to the person about to die there
you could also make the cemetery and sea of souls have an interesting trait
where its just a black white gray color scheme
itd add to the atmosphere at least in the guiding to death scenes
whos that character you showed btw
mc?
whats the setting of the game
oh yea how are you gonna get music for the game
music in games like os and ut is so important to the atmosphere
@Pixel whats his main facial expression gonna be
like in his character model and sprites
HEAR ME OUT YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS ITS SUCH A COOL POSE
like make his character model when guiding the souls have some kind of lantern like that
and itd be a white light
true
it could be just a gray sprite of the mc
but how do you give it this translucent sorta vibe
like its fading
you should put that all over the sea of souls
and itd be just this small circle of white light where its kind of visible
from the lantern
anyways this but hes extending his arm out of the boat
kinda like this but shorter arm obv
and the trench coat would look very good with that
ok what about a gray river
that leads to it
and then its like a waterfall down to it
and thats where he parts way with the soul
and also where you could enter it by interacting with him
what.
is that like
the silksong dev
who then
why would it be silksong related
OH THE CAKE IS A LIE SO SILKSONG IS A LIE
pure lies and bait
true
WHY DO THEY LOOK LIKE CHIHIRO AND FUUKA
no
@Pixel @Pixel @Pixel
ZELDA IS ON JUJUTSUFOLK OVER

u could make so much rot with it pixel
endless possibilities
ENDLESS
when will you
you need to read it
it would change you worse than persona and nso did
zelda would genuinely take his fathers gun if you made berserk pj rot
i used to make berserk rot in 2021
god was it horrible
i tried to get zelda into berserk once
but didnt work
so you need to
look isnt he silly
PIXEL
GREAT SELLING POINT FOR BERSERK
THERES A COMEDIC RELIEF NAKED FAIRY

WAIT WHY ARE THE GRAPHICS GOOD?
yea
i thought its like mc always same graphics
the game can acc be good?
ok hear me out
its not always the same coffin
he lets the coffin
go down the waterfall
also another way to humanise him would be making the coffin seem very heavy and make him sorta hunched back to illustrate the weight of his burden of being death
idk about ur butterfly character but
r u just making a 1:1.

It's Going Down Now, but it's ATTACK ON TITAN STYLE (Persona 3 Reload)
Had a lot of fun with this Persona 3 Reload cover :) Tried to emulate the style of Hiroyuki Sawano in his Attack on Titan soundtrack "Wings OF Freedom". Let me know what you think!
OS...
peak
so many aot haters..
i hope you get uzis solver tail shoved from the ass through the mouth
what was that i couldnt see
no it wasnt
it was the old bitch from p5
post it again
same
hear me out on this one
HEAR
ME
OUT
LOOK PIXEL
fuck i genuinely cant think of anything
to push the agenda
no
ill just turn it from 1h to perma if u ask again
is it copyright if its only the ingame name
oh
youre so rotted
holy fuck
wait reminds me when
i went to venice for a day after p3 depression
and i heard persona on the radio in italy
it means person in italian
how much dyk about metaphor
i saw a post with metaphor screenshots the graphics look so good
i need to finish p5 sometime
also elden ring
how many sprites do u have made
show one for a sec
why
how
like a pattern or smt?
show
why
youve never showed me anything from the gmae
?
is it still like very early draft
that character you sent looked fine
dont you plan on releasing this.
when did you start working on it
was the "makotoifiedflochforster" part of it
when zelda pretended to not know who makoto is
because persona rot didnt breach yet
also wdyt of the song from ep8
u should rewatch then
HUH
the fuck for
i dont let my parents stay in for longer than like 1 min
why even watch it then
ep8 had quite a few scenes
not very appropriate for parents and younger brother
what type of character is it
what color is the outfit
good color but yellow eyes would be literally velvet room
what hair color and other accessories if there are some
@Pixel i was looking up
md lore on reddit
cyn is canonically a child in the manor
explain yourself, pixel
ghost
ghost again
ik not tabbed all the time
sy again
bro u deleted before i csn read
"i said stop"
KYS
thin ice
dont lie now
how can a dress make her emo
kinda looks like alula
i do that sometomes
if its a weekend or on vacation
i have
a wonderful idea
ark pacifist run
since i cant really do the main objective (beating the boss) due to needing to kill it the objective is to get all the artifacts without killing a single creature
i can only get shit like hide and meat from dinos killed by other dinos
i looked up ark on twitter and one of the first results is unspoilered uncensored resident evil porn.
im deleting this fucking app.
so some niche thing or actually viable
LMAO DO IT
endure is only once no
make it the amount of damage youre originally gonna get hit by with defense in the calculation but not the amount damage you receive
so you can use it with endure on some insanely high hp thing
ye thats the thing
make bosses like elizabeth too
make sure defense is calculated into it so if u want to use it ur gonna go for low defense
how r u doing it
and is it gonna be a party like deltarune and persona or
how do u attack
like do u jsut press smt likei n persona
can u get more than one attack
nah just like
3-5 diff attacks
can u miss ur attacks
can it repel
and can attacks be weak to a certain enemy
repel is a very underused mechanic in persona give it more strategic uses
oh yea i beat that minotaur boss in 3rd block by waiting for it to charge its strongest attack then using a phys mirror tr tr tr
i unironically know someone whod do that
do i ask?
what level of egyptianism and greed is not wanting to play elden ring to not reach 2h so i cant refund it anymore
like
i dont even plan on refunding it
im just a greedy fuck
WHAT
ok pixel
those white haired robots
from nier
what do they remind you of?
tr tr tr tr
fucking hell im depressed because i cant get myself to like ark anymore
looking back on it only one map was actually enjoyable and another was only enjoyable in retrospect because of nostalgia and attachment to it
i spent so many hours on slop
island and aberration are the ONLY good maps everything else fucking sucks and is a soulless shitty disgusting sloppy cashgrab and i hate it I HATE THIS GAME
im trying out what people call "the best map in ark" rn AND IT FUCKING SUCKS ITS JUST EVERYTHING CRAMMED ONTO ONE MAP ITS BAD I HATE IT IT SUCKS I FUCKING AHTE IT I FUCKING HATE ARK I FUCKING HATE THIS G AME I FUCKING HATE IT

i sound way too bad in thst clip
just forget it
horrid HORRID game design
u get thrown into a world where everything kills u with no explanation
only explanation i got was to go to stormveil
terraria isnt bad game design the game is just fucking boring
i was able to progress without looking up shit
i was having a really great time actually but NOOOO  i have to make a hell elevator
and i kept hitting water and lava
do i just gave up on the game
great without that aspect though
NO PIXEL
THE PROBLEM IS GETTING RID OF THE LAVA
NOT DYING TO IT
oh noone told me thst...
ill pick it up again tmr
way better than elden slop
was really looking forward to wall of flesh anyway
i alr got the doll im pretty sure
so i can fight it asap
ive been there pixel
i just didnt have an elevator
i used an impracticsl tunnel that takes like 5 mins to get to hell
from my first caving experience
why?
is it insanely hard or smt
well im on normal so
how long to complete a first playthrough btw
like 80h?
agony

WHAT
look
i was hoping for zelda to gift me before someone spotted a contradiction
dont blame me

its enough to have a fake transmasc pronouns page of me (idk who made it) and super writing porn fanfiction of me already
@FlochForster • Pronouns.page
Usage examples of personal pronouns and gender neutral language.
alreqdy asked zelda and its fake
this could be us but NOOOOO youre still closeted
whyyy
lets be cute depressed suicidal lesbian robot girls

twitter REALLY REALLY wants me to follow elon musk for some reason
excuse me
EXCUSE ME??

lets get matching sh scars and show them to each other
i follow only the jjk leaker
same
but like years ago
omori is way too edgy
also what happened to timeout, pixel?
in your head or
why would you schizo up so many different things before finishing one of them?
show the mc
of the current game youre making
also wtf is the name
ok so ill take it like this
the name is stupid and temporary or theres no name
first letter?
is the name dex
agony
lets just say
adachi has a sexual awakening in store for me in august
zeldas young teacher with the persona moon sticker
is ms toriumi in the zeldalordic persona universe
and they will bond over and have a social link when zelda opens okbp in pc class
??????????????????????????????
you could manipulate me into hurting myself
isnt that hot
you fear the contents of my pc
if zelda is 18 then
you can make
the idea you wanted to make
so long ago
ok so
what that word meant
the term cuny
means
the uh
of a loli
ok all ill say is that he unironically jerks off
to
well
we need to
find super
and kill him
shoot him to death
super roblox profile
someone needs to shoot him
do you ever just get hit with a huge realization at 3am
holy fuck im crashing out on everyone when i wake up

new update
i need akechi to win
akechi is such a cutie tho
actually akechi wouldnt have a big dick
hes a bottom
joker fucks the shit out of him

so
akechi would be more submissive though no?

is that cactabyte
wait why was ur ign pixelatedface
what happened to that account
how much did u pay for it
i used to buy alts for like 2$ and i still have access to a lot of them
how long did it last
why was it ign pixelatedface then
who tf owns it
wait so
zelda played on a cracked server
so your egypt ass could play mc
then how did you meet zelda on a server
whyd he be on a cracked server
could mecatt not afford a mc account
let me guess
magnus couldnt afford an account either
what ign did he have
LMAO
does not exist
ohh
cuz when i looked up pixelatedface
someone had that
then why not pick something actually cool
like Pex
or Extinction
or Amogus
oh no i have money noooo
did you get a mc account the moment you saw an orespawn video and thought it looked cool?
thats sad
whats ur average meal
yummy
is your only source of water cactuses
is a scorched earth playthrough your day to day life
it is
do u have a wyvern pixel
do you have a morellatops to conserve water
what about jerboas to alert you of weather
these are mine jerboas
look at the names
you fucking WISH hollow knight was this good
look its smegma gobbler, balls fondler and urethra pincher
WHAT
that looks peak????
its like this area from aberration
wtf
is this aura
ic an see why
how late into the game is it
whats desolate dive
wait cool movement shit exists wtf???
so its ultrakill but 2d??
also is it actually slow as fuck
i told thomas to play ultrakill today and he said hes more used to slower shit like hk
with souls like do you mean ill get ambushed by something i cant actually fight for a while in a place thats said to be safe?
ok but how bullshit is it
will you have a fight against something that takes 30+ hits to kill that can onetap you 4h into the game?
said onetap is a big aoe btw
so like smoke bomb in cuphead
is there any random huge difficulty spikes
theres no unfair shit correct
also no unfair bugs (looking at you ark survival evolved)
is path of pain fun when you learn the mechanics of the game
ultrakill brutal is SO fun when you actually know the mechanics and techs
i love completely skipping 3-2 gabriel's first phase in 2 seconds
so like elizabeth from p3r?
optional but good reward
PIXEL

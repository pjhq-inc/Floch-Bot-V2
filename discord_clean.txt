mythology of the Mayans, and ordered searches in Mayan ancient ruins for the secret art of necromancy. He also did not commit suicide in 1945, but went into hiding in Antarctica with his last few supporters and created the Last Battalion, who will take over Xibalba and become a god by triggering a mass

Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.iki never went on oneshot redditbecause its furries and pedophilesthis is Robertwhen is judgement day againWHATTHIS IS HOW WW3 STARTSMISERABLE EGYPTIAN PUMPKIN

discovered rain world by myself i would probably get it and play itbut now never.it has very interesting lore and everythingbut it would always remind me of that fucking pumpkin monkeyyea iki might get p5 because one of my friends really likes it and said its one of the best games hes playedbut p3r NEVER after thisthe trailer he spammed everywhere:p5 is also the game hes mentioned the leastyeaill pretend its working and im being interestedso he stops being insanill pretend im in a bad financial s ituationill say i got subnautica and whatever other shit i buy giftedlying:i am not in

false hope or make him hate adachihes not that fucking derangedi do plan on buying all persona games at dome point to mentally torture pixel and tell him ill play them over and overbecause its an actual good game if you ignore the 600 bugs it hasthe best way to describe ark is a very beatiful gf that fucking hates you and abuses younah ill buy p4 insteadmax tortureyes thats whyyou will suffer in ark i will suffer in p4i want to see you beat all 3 guardians on alphaand do all achievementscan be done in 200h, it took me 500h cuz i didnt breed rexes while doing other shit but after and i

make much progressalso if it wasnt obvious enough, you are playing the map called "The Island" under story mapshf in the redwoodsi want u to ss when u go there first timea chain of unrelated events and conditions at the wrong time can lead to anythingi will play p4g and after that more singleplayer shitpixel is lucky that he wins due to coincidencesby the time you play ark i will already quit itbetter than arkalso adachi!trust me its going to be way better than arkfinish it then play arkpeople have done it in like 15h or lessdo you thinki can do p4g on a shitty laptoptrust me you wontmain

you wanna know the main source of lore i have?NO WTF THATS SPOILERSOnce your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model.

fucking stupidwhats the best storyline and character developmentp3r or p5rP3R HAS THIS??????????HOLY SHIT SHE ACTUALLY ISNT A MINOR LETS GOanywayp3r looks like an actual good game with a good cast and

changed to Fuhrer with sunglasses in some other releaseIn the PSP remake, Hitler receives a mild censorship. His name is replaced by "Fuhrer," and he wears black sunglasses to cover his eyes.The infamous German dictator that took power in 1933 and the mastermind of World War II. According to Mrs. Ideal, Hitler started the World War to advance human evolution and studied the sorcery and mythology of the Mayans, and ordered searches in Mayan ancient ruins for the secret art of necromancy. He also did not commit suicide in 1945, but went into hiding in Antarctica with his last few supporters and created the Last Battalion, who will take over Xibalba and become a god by triggering a mass extinction event.WHO COOKED THISWHO FUCKING THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEAIS THAT THE ONLY ISSUE YOU HAVE WITH IT???i see why noone mentions p2 nowthe final boss is probably stalin or

playedbut im not making myself miserable just to make someone else more miserablethis is why i am just gonna ignore pixel from now onman i lost all my will to play pissowner nowyou know what started this entire argument zeldalord one?me not wanting to do 30 hours of a miserable grind for 1.5 skyblock levels (nothing) because i have irl shit to do and better games to playhes so fucking addicted to skyblock that he thinks hes entitled to making me play so the grinds are more efficient@ZeldaLord genuinely what do i dothis shit ends todaynot an optioni dont want to leave the sb community with him spreading lies about me 24/7 how im a ratter looter etcany other optionsim thinking about it a lot recently which is badbecause i dont want to overthink BLOCK GAME SHITnah he knows how schizo i amabout all personal and security shitsp what elseeveryone in skyblock is like him or worse sadlywhere do idoes thatmake him unable to spout lies about me after?i want to reach a conclusionwhere both of us are somehow satisfied then can block eachother permanently and never talk to eachother againbut hes so fucking immature and selfishi literally offered him a conclusion which any non selfish person would be happy aboutwhich was me never playing again and only caring about investmentsbut he had the audacity to tell me to leave my own minecraft account linked to my irl microsoftand he said if i care about investments i should flip for 2 hours a day minimumlike who the fuck is he brohes a mentally disturbed french 15 yearo ldwe were actually good close friends at the timewe were until recentlywhen he started gooning to skyblockand now he copes about shit, has a massive ego, became very selfish and acts gay sometimesok zeldai havereached a conclusionill get the account wiped intentionally but through an actual 90d banthat way he gets off my dick permanently because hell be mad as shitbut he cant get me banned anywhere for itno not reallyif i can be bothered to i can even place the blame on himstupid no manipulateable yespixel isan interesting case.how did iit wasnt a threat zeldaits just a funny remindeive done it a few timesits still weird enough to a pointthat he gets creeped outbecause if he doesnt then im concernedthe thing is zeldai have done shit in the past that is very much wipeablevery much.nah zeldaremove that element from this scenario completelyi know how id deal with itfocus on the other aspects of ittheres this thing ive used in the past a few times thats a bit hard to pull off but it works well on mentally weak peopleyou and preferrably a bit more people make fun of someone and convince them their beliefs based on objective truth are wrong and that theyre just schizoing which leads to an internal conflict within themselves that makes them question if theyre just insane for believing itits more of a long term gaslightalthoughin this scenario a few things could maybe go wrongit is by FAR the safest onebut for nowill just see if theres any reason to coming to a more peaceful conclusionquite literally the last attemptnanako rank 3!FUCKI MISSED 3 POINTSBECAUSE NO COURAGEHOW THE FUCK DO YOU GET COURAGE POINTS IN THIS FUCKING

cool is that one of the only grades well do is a presentation on a newer influential figure(i will cook so hard on the kendrick lamar presentation)oh its THATOHHHHHTHATSYEAGL LMAOthats one of the

CASE OF ONLY GIVING CRUCIAL INFO **AFTER**one of the funniest shit in school in a long time was last fridaybiology bitch thinks its a good idea for us to go for an outside lesson which would last 3 hourslike 40 of us on like 5 logsthen we all started to molest eachother out of boredom and she ragequit and let us go homeit was so fucking funny?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????WHAT WATER WAS SHE TALKING ABOUT ZELDAI WANT TO FUCKING KNOWTAP WATER????????YEA NOjustskipoh yea what does she do if you call her situations stupid and criticize them?she is actually smart wtfprobably has zero education, makes up schizo bullshit and its legal because thats what the class is foractual legal loopholeoh that reminds me of when a guy said hell report me to the german police for online death threats because i got him banned from a server (when later asked to provide said death threats to moderators of that discord he backed out)zelda that guy and your teacher are the exact same1. pathological liar2. makes up bullshit threats3. masive egozelda your teacher is raidermchas she leaked architecthors face reveal to the class yetbecause its the only thing she can do after becoming irrelevant and being banned everywherewhich is your second worst classonly bad class i can think of would be biology and art (dont ask why i have that shit bavaria is just retarded)do you also have art in serbiawhenlast year?here we have it for entirety of hshow is it in miserablelandwe cant choose much heresome shit is just mandatoryidk why art isalso zelda thoughts on PHILOSOPHYwe have that shit for SOME fucking reasoni cant really speak on phiolsophy becausewe all skipeach year we just do the same shit with

just me (i lived in us)we have a 45yo fat body positivity english teacheri like teachers who just let u do whatever the fuck u want if u prove that u alr know all the shit theyre yapping aboutsome exist here thankfullyyk whats funnyevery german here can speak english wellbut the accent and pronounciation is SO FUCKING BADi literally developed a german accent just from talking to friendsits miserablealsoin foreign countries like germanywhy is most of english writing shit down??the main problem people here have is PRONOUNCIATIONoh yea in like 2 weekswere supposed to do the 3h outside biology class againevery lesson here literally ends when the fucking bell rings and the lesson isnt even done yet...ask her about pissowner in private.do it.the rot spreading out of discord would be

because i fucking hate pixeltheres an nsfw role in the server apparentlysoyea all this shit and the mitsuru outfit ruined mitsuru for mei mean it didnt work for kanji and naotomaybe itll end when i see more of mitsurus storyat the start zeldathen when i played the entire gamei slowly realizedi hope itll be same for the p3 charactersthis was during the gamefor yosuke kanji naoto it was fine after i finished the gameyosuke: constantly makes fun of kanji for the gay dungeonokbp: yu and yosuke are the best gay couple p4r NEEDS a romance for yosukewhen i did kanji and naoto sl it was when i actually began to like the characters a loti thought shinji and akihiko were gay (reddit rabbit hole) but no theyre just both suffering from a ton of traumaITS IN A GUARDIAN FLOOR CHESTsame for yukarip3r characters hit hardi want to see more of the mitsuru shit that was in julyit was really intereatingestranging herself from her family and the guilt of whatever the fuck happened in the original seesi really feel liketheres some buildupto all of the shit from 2y agoall colliding at somep ointis that 10/4do i replay 3-4h and a bossto not throw away 4 days of fatty slonly 2 were actual rabbitholrsother 4 were just okbp postskanji and naotoonly went into those rabbitholesafter finishing the gamebecause i wanted to see the thought processand the conclusion i came to is that the lgbt non binary 16 year old white girls have too much free time to spend on headcanonsbasicallyfemale to male trans peoplemade headcanons about naoto being transand everyone picked up on it(it couldnt be more wrong to her character(yes representation or whatever but naoto becoming trans would literally be her falling back into needing to present as male to not be viewed and treated differentlyits so wrongkanjithey act like hes gay or bisexual (him being gay in his dungeon was cope because he was afraid of being rejected by anyone and not even in a romantic situation)and im not even gonna comment on people calling him gay because of his sl him making those toys (they missed the whole fucking point of his character)which oneyosukei have genuinely no fucking idea why anyone calls him gayand ive never looked into it and never willakihiko and shinjiropeople make ship art(they are traumatised orphans both with huge amounts of guilt)mitsuru.THEY REDUCE HER CHARACTER TO A SOFT WEAK BITCH WHO RELIES ON MAKOTO FOR EVERYTHINGi opened the fanfic channel like 3 timesbut it was always just making her a blank characterto insert headcanons into??????oh thats fucked upthats quite fucked upi thought elizabeth quest items were filler dialoguedo you like my school dialogue skipping btwits a parallel to how much i give a fuck about biologytest on thursday btw!thats all the charavtersstereotype "needs to rely on her man for everything"anyway im very surprised how mitsuru is the sanest in seesthe p3p poster made me think shed be yukaris bully or somethingshe just gives

almost fell offWTF IS ELECTRIC CHAIR EXECUTIONalso im reinstalling p5r please tell pixel to not do anythingthats cool howeverbiggest hear me out ever butthis ark map is literally peakits subnautica level of goodand one of the zones is so similar to deep grand reef and cove treeand the creatures are so cool and uniqueits an entire new gamehelp architecthor keeps singing "kiddy diddler"not even the graphics just the aestheticand it has actual horror elements to it like subnauticaand fun mechanicshi im posting an ark loredumpsystem born = earthfall = go from the arks in space to earthsanctuaries = the city and the 2 prototype hot and cold arksancestors = as i said prototype arks flightless = very early stages of the arks shit as the island extinction note says so theyre on the ground as domes your ancestor = humanity extinct as evident by the hologram model of earth being completely fuckedborn within the system = humanity extinct and its just dna of random people across earth from all timeframes being uploaded to whatever the fuck the system is design altered = survivors are literally DATA that can be uploaded and the implants presumably have it all stored but theyre still humans and have human dnawhen you fall = sent to extinction aka earth homecoming more ways than one = both humans SOMEHOW repopulating a destroyed earth (the main thing i havent figured out yet) and the system is presumably hosted on earth so both the humanity and the ark tech fuckery return to earth and the prototype arksthis also confirms that arks were being developed when humanity still existed and not something advanced ai made 294923 billion years after only thing i cant figure out is what wiped out earth ive also finally figured out now what the extinction map truly is its the facility where arks were being first created and tested and also probably the birthplace of the system that would also let them put dinosaurs on earth because they escaped the long abandoned prototype arks when humanity went extinct so safe to say everything from scorched and the island is on extinction and probably new ice creaturesso now for abberation the map im playing rnTHIS CONFIRMSTHAT THERES PEOPLE ALIVE OUTSIDE THE ARKS ON SOME FUCKING SPACESHIPAND THEY CAME TO ABBERATION BEFORE ROCKWELL BASICALLY DESTROYED AND MUTATED IT BECAUSE THE EXPLORER NOTE SHOWS A BARRIERBUT WHEN YOU ASCEND FROM THE ISLAND THERES NO BARRIER AROUND IT UNLIKE FOR SCORCHEDWHICH MEANS THE TEK COLONY PEOPLE FROM SOME SPACESHIP ARRIVED ON ABBERATION EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER HELENA AND ROCKWELL BUT DEFINITELY BEFORE ROCKWELL FUCKED UP ABBERATIONTHIS ALSO EXPLAINS THE HUGE AMOUNT OF TEK SHIT ON ABBERATIONARK: Survival Evolved Season Pass on Steamits peak it has all 3 maps scorched earth, abberation and extinction700+ hours of genuine peak graphics gameplay worldbuilding and storytelling for the low price of 15$if i buy hk do you promise youll buy thisyou do not understandthe peak that is abberationits like subnautica all over again and im only 5h inits like an entirely different gamealso the visuals are good as in the aesthetic and setting not just the graphicsits a really similar vibe to subnauticaand subnautica isnt the best graphics but had one of the best visualsso its not about the graphics.theres also reapers (theyre like reaper leviathans but black and extremely scary)ill downloadbtw is hk off rnim buying it when it iswait i know what to sayif half life 2 is so apparently so "good"whyd they never make half life 3do i buy it@ZeldaLord why are the graphics

like talking to pixelits comedicalNO?INV ME TO PJ??? the fuck is he sayingdid you talk to him or smtHDUQmy boyfriend was posting theseyou called the brocolli shit schizophrenic?i just read thisYeah... i hate to don the tinfoil hat but there's real signs it's not over in the teaser video alone.He's been dropping hints for a while that he draws inspiration from being a Gemini and the teaser trailer that dropped minutes before this one points to that again.  We saw with the Not Like Us video that PG Lang loves the detailIn the trailer, we see him get OUT of one of the TWO GNXs. He leaves it parked and still running but facing the opposite direction. The other GNX that is already parked there also running implying that somone is there already.We then see Kendrick get out of the car in the same outfit that is on the GNX cover.We get a verse which summarizes the themes of GNX: Fuck everyone else, reincarnation, war ready but driven by Love, a nod to his pen / writing. We also get a mention of "his gemini twin" in that verseThe camera cuts to kendrick in a different outfit, in a event storage area,  and the beat switches to a more aggressive beat. This new kendrick is kneeling on top of a black piano and a black set of event chairs. To the back of the frame there is a set of white event chairs facing the opposite way.The video ends at the 1 minute mark mid verse indicating there's more.PG lang is way too disciplined to make the teaser include a song that ended up the cutting room floor. Especially with the production having the traditional Kendrick feel. That being said GNX is not a teaser or mixtape. It's a legitimate album that fills in some of the critiques of his discography. Ive listened to it front to back at least 6 times and it only gets better. It does feel like its not Kendrick rapping at the height of his abilities though.did i ping youi meant to ping pixelsecondcan you explain thisdoes this happen regularly in pjbw gc?i assume you are

mmmsee this is where i would send spoilered cropped ark porn but ark is a dinosaur game so i cantis this better baitthats ark players for ark 2(they made a complete remake of all maps in unreal engine 5 instead of ark 2 which was meant to release in 2023)Cause and effect is the way of the universe. Everything must start somewhere. In the case of the System, this is where it was born. You will fall right into its cradle.Together, the sanctuaries and the Obelisks that power them are the ancestor of every island that floats in the sky. They can all can trace their origins back to this single prototype. Though it is flightless, the core principles and technology behind it are the same.In a way, that makes it your ancestor too. You were all born within the System, after all. Even if your design is somewhat altered, in a way, you're all its children.One could say that when you fall, it will be something of a homecoming. In more ways than one.system born = earthfall = go from the arks in space to earthsanctuaries = the city and the 2 prototype hot and cold arksancestors = as i said prototype arks flightless = very early stages of the arks shit as the island extinction note says so theyre on the ground as domes your ancestor = humanity extinct as evident by the hologram model of earth being completely fuckedborn within the system = humanity extinct and its just dna of random people across earth from all timeframes being uploaded to whatever the fuck the system is design altered = survivors are literally DATA that can be uploaded and the implants presumably have it all stored but theyre still humans and have human dnawhen you fall = sent to extinction aka earth homecoming more ways than one = both humans SOMEHOW repopulating a destroyed earth (the main thing i havent figured out yet) and the system is presumably hosted on earth so both the humanity and the ark tech fuckery return to earth and the prototype arksthis also confirms that arks were being developed when humanity still existed and not something advanced ai made 294923 billion years after only thing i cant figure out is what wiped out earth ive also finally figured out now what the extinction map truly is its the facility where arks were being first created and tested and also probably the birthplace of the system that would also let them put dinosaurs on earth because they escaped the long abandoned prototype arks when humanity went extinct so safe to say everything from scorched and the island is on extinction and probably new ice creatures@ZeldaLord when im home wanna vci need someone to yap my ark schizophrenia towhyyou dont need to talk igjust listen to my yapOK FINEWDYM FRENCH AT THE STARTCAN YOU NOT RUIN A GAME

the exact number of 16 of my classmates:not exclusivelyill also do salmon and shitand obv im steal gonna do breakfast and fruits and vegetablesonly thing im doing is less calories in meals and absolutely nothing with any fatno zelda i meanhigh amounts of fat with thati know everything has fat im not THAT retardedhow am i pulling thateveryone around me is sane and i am sane tooyoure the one calling me my entire friendgroup and my entire class retardednohave you consideredthat we value playing clash royale and fucking around over studying the most boring shit imagineable

people do thatare you gonna say thats an eating disorder too?not anymorei will be seasoning my foodok true ig but i dont do it anymoreno i do it in the normal way now trust meanyway zeldalord would you be interested in me shilling workout to youfrom what ive been doing the past 10 months you dont even need to go outside you can do it all in your room with 4 dumbells!the results speak for themselvesor i have stupidly op geneticsprobably bothanyway zeldalorddid you knowyou can eat healthy food and it can taste extremely good?way better than any fast food slop?since ive started seasoning my food i realized how good it can getyou dont need to eat ice cream or fast food because trust me you can definitely make way better food yourselfok fair enough i get a schnitzel every week toowhat do you eat as your regular lunch and dinneri really want to give a good comparison/allegory but the only good ones i can think of are either ark or skyblockthat emoji sucksthe ice cream crashout was more of an overexaggerationnot theb acon fries tho thats just disgustingeven if it wasnt pure slop and extremely unhealthy id still hate iti could never eat thatbulking is NOT binge eatingdo you think i liked the unseasoned boiled chicken and rice or that i ate it as protein fuelbecause it isntthe normal meals i havei properly enjoythe boiled chicken is just pure misery until the plastic container is emptyi always get it done fast thowell you have to make sacrifices in lifeok i thought of a comparison that isnt skyblockor arkzelda do you study because you like school and studying or because you have to pass.this is literally boiled chicken, zeldayes its fucking miserable but its neededwhats the better outlook"i hate eating this miserable food i should stop ngl""this is nesseccary protein fuel"i didi will provide image proofbig pex is lying to you seasoning sucks out all of the proteinalsoi eat like kinda normal food nowfrom 2 boiled chicken for just fuel 2 seasoned chicken to 2 seasoned chicken for just fuel 1 seasoned chicken as an actual meal not just to eat asap from a plastic container and 1 rice bowl with soy sauce soy beans avocado and a shitton of salmon(salmon is

insane graphics but they fumbled it SO HORRIBLY that it looks horrendousyou do not put insanely bright lighting in a wasteland and weird yellow fog in only place supposed to still be kinda aliveit looks fucking horriblei cant believe they killed the best lore in any media to sell a 30$ dlcand theyre gonna continue the retarded retconned storyline based on the horrible animatrd series for ark

so idk about that partoh yea theres 80 p3s i just rememberedyeah but mainly the art directionalso they added a p2w creature which is just no.wait 1si need to show you a few comparisonsso you can see how fucking SLOPPY it isyesthe new ark is just light mode spamfor context the setting is a dying uninhabitale toxic wastelandits like an entirely different team designed all thisZERO consideration for the original aesthetic and the setting of the mapthey all probably left because the behind the scenes is pretty sloppyand they went bankrupt because of being retarded like 80 timesbasically atlus 2holy shit YOU CAN SHOW OFF YOUR RAY TRACING BULLSHIT WITHOUT SPAMMING LIGHT IN EVERYONES FACE IN EVERY LOCATIONit looks like ai garbageand i wouldnt be surprised if it iswith ark 2 do you mean ark 2

euthanizedi alr closed ityeawhat platform is it onOcarina of Time v1.0 ROMwhats thisOnce BizHawk has been installed, open EmuHawk and change the following settings:    (≤ 2.8) Go to Config > Customize. Switch to the Advanced tab, then switch the Lua Core from "NLua+KopiLua" to "Lua+LuaInterface". Then restart EmuHawk. This is required for the Lua script to function correctly. NOTE: Even if "Lua+LuaInterface" is already selected, toggle between the two options and reselect it. Fresh installs of newer versions of EmuHawk have a tendency to show "Lua+LuaInterface" as the default selected option but still load "NLua+KopiLua" until this step is done.    Under Config > Customize > Advanced, make sure the box for AutoSaveRAM is checked, and click the 5s button. This reduces the possibility of losing save data in emulator crashes.    Under Config > Customize, check the "Run in background" and "Accept background input" boxes. This will allow you to continue playing in the background, even if another window is selected.    Under Config > Hotkeys, many hotkeys are listed, with many bound to common keys on the keyboard. You will likely want to disable most of these, which you can do quickly using Esc.    If playing with a controller, when you bind controls, disable "P1 A Up", "P1 A Down", "P1 A Left", and "P1 A Right" as these interfere with aiming if bound. Set directional input using the Analog tab instead.    Under N64 enable "Use Expansion Slot". This is required for savestates to work. (The N64 menu only appears after loading a ROM.)It is strongly recommended to associate N64 rom extensions (*.n64, *.z64) to the EmuHawk we've just installed. To do so, we simply have to search any N64 rom we happened to own, right click and select "Open with…", unfold the list that appears and select the bottom option "Look for another application", then browse to the BizHawk folder and select EmuHawk.exe.im sorry what.ok i ran the emuhawk thing nothing is happeningwhere???@ZeldaLord are you here cuz otherwise ill sleep and we do this tmrokill

Him or You? To which Uni replied: Well, if he opens his domain "Progenitor Core", it will cause problems for me. Would you lose? Nah, I'd win.When MSI and Uni clashed in battle, MSI used his innate technique "Left Right", while it is active, everyone in MSI's line of sight must move according to his voice, left or right. But Uni activated his Domain, "Gaza Strip". Then MSI had to activate its Domain. The Uni Domain turned out to be stronger, he emerged victorious by destroying the Core with his Water Pistol. Then MSI asked: Are you the strongest because you are Uni, or are you Uni because you are the strongest? Then Uni answered: I am the strongest, because I am Велике Сисе!

Yuji is highly determined to end everything with this last chance. He even spits his blood at Sukuna's face as an attack. Yuji tells himself that this is the last chance to defeat Sukuna & bring back MegumiRika grabs hold of Sukuna & slams him down while Yuji lands a kick on Sukuna at the same time Sukuna realises that his CE output & control over Megumi's body has gotten pretty dullTo counterattack, Sukuna disables Hollow Wisker Basket & plans to unleash “World cutting slash” while trying to tank damage from Angel's Jacob ladderBut Yuji & Yuta has already predicted that Sukuna would make such plan. They try to tie up Sukuna hands while continuing to attack SukunaYuta notices that Sukuna's slashes are getting weaker & decides to move closer towards Sukuna without fearingYuta cuts off one of Sukuna's arms & Yuji makes the blood which he had spit on Sukuna's face explodeSmall flashback to Yuji narrating that souls can be basically be combined just a little but they will never become one, as per Yuki's notes. With that Yuji says he will surely wake up Megumi's soulHana adds that Angel's CT is a good match for Yuji's plan. The plan is to separate Sukuna & Megumi's soul & dull Sukuna's tuning with Megumi's body & hit him with Jacob ladderWhile Rika & Yuji grabs hold of Sukuna's arms, Yuta activates Angels CT “Maxim Output: Jacob's Ladder” We can see Sukuna burnt crisp after receiving that attackYuji moves back & hits Sukuna with his soul attack punch while saying, “Wake up, Fushiguro”Yuji had calculated everything precisely but Megumi's soul no longer had the will to live. Yuji sees Megumi repeatedly saying “I don't care anymore”SUKUNA IMMEDIATELY HITS YUTA, RIKA & YUJI WITH WORLD CUTTING SLASH!!!Narrator criticises Sukuna saying for falling for the surprise attack by Maki. It's a common practice among Jujutsu Sorcerers & a mediocre plan which could've been easily avoidable by Sukunaok its translated for youread iti will make your life hellthere are worms under your

heart and it was 5 partsand then this retard makes a "the heart part 6" which was a dissduring the drake and kendrick rap battleand now kendrick made the real heart part 6?yes zeldalordkendricks songs have actual meaning isnt that crazywow guess who stayed up all night to analyze this album!??!??!?!?!no he waskendrick is not travistravis just spits random shit kendrick puts thought into ithe literally released the album6 months 16 days after his drake diss 6 16 in laand that song youre referencing he teased in his last drake diss not like usi havent even seen people bring it up yeti was just looking for anything i could find and stumbled across thatall his shit is known for extremely deep meanings thoyour video game ost gooner ass wouldnt get itits oklike you just hate to hate without trying to understand shitam i not allowed to enjoy my favorite musicno zeldalord how bad is your memory?if i make schizo theories and overanalyze persona and ark what would make you think i wouldnt do the same for music???you are like the brit, zeldalordpulls up some unreleased travis song and goes: "how is kendrick yapping about some poem in the most monotone voice possible better than this"spooky the kuudra gang adminaka my boyfriend soon to be husband@ZeldaLord guess who his favorite artist iswhat screenshotwhich one zeldawhat oneanyway zeldalordunblock me on my mainill stop shilling ark ive given up on itim beating all maps solo like the sigma i ami hate all of you?thats three imagessecond one looks nicerid call you retarded but im also gonna spend a lot on some "magnetic" keyboard because i have a ton of money to waste but its not enough money to buy a 4080ti4080ti is the min requirement for the new ark gamehe says faggot like 9 times in one song btwhow much is a ryzen 9cputell mebro plssome good ryzen 9 cpu and a 4080tishould make me able to run arkthats minimum requirements for the lowest graphics zeldalord.not even 4090 can run best graphics idtor not consistently4080ti should still be goated graphics tho@ZeldaLord how much is a ryzen 9 cpuoh fucki neednew monitornew cpunew gpufor ark@ZeldaLord i dont even think you can consistently do 60fps with max graphics on 4090yes idk shit about pcsexplain itlook it upits justtheyre not the best with optimizationor bugsor combat balancingok a lot could be better but its still peak and best gameEpic settings at 1080p: With the graphics of Ark: Survival Ascended cranked to their maximum values, even at 1080p the RTX 4090's performance divebombs, only hitting 60 FPS on occasion. The game should remain playable on the RX 7900 XTX, RTX 4080, and RX 7900 XT, so long as you don't mind a target of 30 FPS.idk all of the ark development shit is pretty messyearly access.zeldalord learns to readthere will be one soon probablyall maps arent out yet so its ifneeverything in ark is delayed.the map APPARENTLY releasing in decembris the 4th mapand theres 6 canon maps not to mention the 6 non canon mapsID RATHER HANG MYSELF THAN EVER WEAR THAT LMFAOthe colori would rather take it up the assthan ever wear thatno jokeIS THIS A PLOT TO MAKE ME KILL MYSELFthis is an outfit for gruncles.what 17 year old wears thiszelda if you dress like thatmain offender is whatever the fuck hes wearing on his feeti have a feeling you dress like thisif you dorethink everythingthe weird asf pants and whatever hes wearing under the sweateryeah they suckwho wears thatmiddle aged fatties?Started a call that lasted 0 minutes.fuck you green acidill main watching youtube i guessok top 3 reason for gc add1. i am the glue of gc (activity wise)2. im bored3. im really really really bored zeldai cba with sociopathic sb fags anymore andreji just want the good ol days of me and pixel arguing over shit that doesnt matter in the slightestbenny melk is an angel compared to catalyst.catalyst is the most insufferable person ive met in skyblockthis screenshot perfectly shows it"i will have redemption arc""i will be good person""i will change"2 seconds later: racial slursall france are worthless filthnopwe were gonna repay but got bannedplaying ark and forgetting sbhe would make it in a weekflochwhy did he say that -

Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.@ZeldaLord should i turn into pixel but ark lorei think that would be funnyill be Pexelated_Face and talk about ark lorethis is canonically the strongest entity

VACATIONcan you not fucking downtimeand we do it AT THE TIME WE SAID.also im abt to do the final ark battleand finish the gameand quitand play p3rout of 12 yeabut idt ill do any more for a bitid rather notcool!why did they have to make the final boss of ark so fucking buggyalso its been 2 hoursno i wontthats for workout and running onlyim gonna add oneshot stuff to itI HAVE COMPLETED ARK SURVIVAL EVOLVEDi have to packbecause vacation tmrTHE NEXT ARK MAP IS LITERALLY CARROT AND PIXELS HOMEok so i just woke up and im more miserable than zeldanow that ive actually slept this is so tragici spent 150 extra hours to beat all ark bosses on hardest difficulty so id get 15 extra levels on my survivor character on all maps after and also keep all levels ive gotten on itthe bossfight was peak and all the pain was worth it and we just barely beat the final bossthen for the final thing which makes you get those 15 extra levels, ascending by going in some spherei successfully do that and download my survivor so i can use it on other mapsi respawn on the map and the opening cinematic crashes mei reopen the game and my survivor character is fucking wiped150 if not all 500 hours i spent on the map were for fucking nothingi need game recommendations before i buy omori and fucking hang myselfTHERE IS PROOF THAT I DID ITWHYyea i sawit actually has good songs on it tooits pretty stupid nglyou can like make a new character any timeand the 15 levels from ascending isnt player basedbut character basedso are the other levelsnopethis wouldve better been spent playing p3 and p5 because i wouldve atleast fucking kept my progressliterally staring at a wall wouldve been more productiveliterally the only thing i can do is make a new character and gigacheat through the final boss and get the 15 extra levels but that just increases my level cap from 105-120 and the 105 levels i got are fucking gonei mean i have the achievement and thats fucking ithowthats it im killing myselfi knew it was fucking buggy as shit BUT NOT THAT IT RAPES YOUR ENTIRE PROGRESSalso ive completely lost motivation even to restart on the next map because the next map is boring as shitit has ZERO lore and ONE bosslike how can it get more fucking boring than thatthe other 2 maps after that are apparently peak but im not gonna botherhow did pixel winim still not buying his bs im actively looking for new stuffi have a strong enough will to not fall into pixels shitalso ark is genuinely fucking retardedyou still need to ascend at lower levels killing easier bosses for all achievementsi thought ascending at highest difficulty would give all 3...you know what the funny thing isyou have 3 bosses and the final bossif you have the tributes from the highest difficulty all 3 bosses you can do any difficulty of the final boss not just the highest one but the lower 2 toobut for the achievement it doesnt work like thatit just forces you to replay it on an easier versionthat was looking into the games from an outside perspective ignoring pixels bullshitthen pixel did so much brainrot i couldnt look at the games without thinking of pixels bullshitare subnautica games also buggy as shitwith bugs that can rape 500 hours of progresscant you just make backups every now and thenand isnt it still a way shorter gameark you can either rollback 10 minutes or 10-50 hours the amount of hours being purely randomno my save didnt diethe stupid system in ark raped itselfi get the rewards of 15 extra levels for beating final boss, i respawn on og map, opening cinematic crashes me, i reopen my game, it tells me to make a new character and my old one is fucking gonethe fucking mastersilly guy will harass himdont bring up shitmastersilly is a fucking demon and when he first figured out i had an account share he harassed over 50 people from skyblock server "cowshed"he is hellbent on figuring out and will leak it everywhere and harass 600 peoplethat was a furry porn server zelda"cowshed 2" was

and shitwtfark also has fucking ancient race of aliensthey sent the element meteor to earthdiepexmaster22Planets, species, even this universe we occupy. All of it has a limit. An end. You are approaching one right now.Don't think of it as sand falling to the bottom of an hourglass, but the hourglass fading away completely. It can't be flipped around or reconstructed. It's irreversible. Permanent. If you want to stop it, you need to hurry.That's not to belittle you. You've been doing great, really! All of you. Most of you. The ones getting eaten alive right now could be better, objectively speaking. The rest though? Great! You’ve advanced so far. Some through kindness, others cruelty, but both are aspects of humanity. Both are needed here on the brink, in the shadow of **Extinction**.More than that, you'll need each other. You'll need help.I should explain, shouldn't I? I mentioned the future, but I should have said "futures."You see the universe, the whole of it, it's all math eventually. Everything has a value that feeds into an equation. You, the stars, the trees you assaulted for bundles of thatch - yes, I saw that. Very rude.But back to math. The future's made of it too, or more specifically, probabilities. They twist and branch in all directions, so tangled that most beings can't sort through them. I can't even see it all, but I can find the most likely threads and follow them along.After all, it’s just math.mahoraga..thats not ark thoits unrelated brainrot@ZeldaLord if pixel can send this can i

funny hahshshsha pex hahahahahaim going to kmshave you seen itim not gooning im ON VACATIONim prob bsck in like3-4dhave you properly researched itark has that too????the 4th map is literally ruins of an advanced wiped out tech civilization on whats probably post extinction earthand you have to kill what wiped out the civilizationwhile discovering the storyin ark during the extinction event, most people got wiped out but some ascended into basically gods that exist in a different plane of realityi mean both ark and rainworld end with you ascendingthe last ascended humans i  this reality are "the overseers" which are more ai than human at that point and oversee their respective arksthey were supposed to welcome you after meeting them and send you to earth to fight whatever killed humanity after beating your first ark, but after eons of noone defeating the things on earth, they began to fight you after meeting them and sending you to more and more arks which had conditions of the earth you are sent toat some point, a group of survivors led by mainly helena walker and mei yin, hacked the system on abberation as they fully killed the overseer with a tek nuke and were able to send themselves and anyone whod come after them right into earth and not more and more arkswhat they also developed was a way for every human to respawn through clones of themselves and data copied from their specimen implantsabberation was also fucked, as rockwell basically overdosed on alien goo and became a big fat monster trapped as the guardian of abberationhelena then after many years of being unable to stop what caused the extinction on earth, ascended into a higher lifeform basically god herselfshe guides the player through a bit of explorer notes on every map from inside "The System"i dont know the full lore of ark yet since i dont look at spoilers, but ascending in ark might be the samemy theory is that to ascend you have to let go of your main attachments to the physical worldfor rockwell probably all his experiments on abberation and for helena probably mei yinzeldalord is an ancient?showzzskibidi backroomsthe 1$ steam game with a bitcoin minerwhy so low resi had 220gb on my

So it is with the System - these islands in the sky. I can speak with the the artificial minds that oversee their operations, but they have a will of their own. They too think, act and live.So to change the system, my suggestions must be minuscule and their purpose masked. Incremental bits of code that are trivial alone, but substantial when whole. Thousands of puzzle pieces, scattered across these islands - these seeds in the sky - slowly coalescing and taking shape...Until at last they formed you.And what are you exactly? Once you break free, once you fall from the sky, I'll tell you your name. It will all make sense to you then.I should explain, shouldn't I? I mentioned the future, but I should have said "futures."You see the universe, the whole of it, it's all math eventually. Everything has a value that feeds into an equation. You, the stars, the trees you assaulted for bundles of thatch - yes, I saw that. Very rude.But back to math. The future's made of it too, or more specifically, probabilities. They twist and branch in all directions, so tangled that most beings can't sort through them. I can't even see it all, but I can find the most likely threads and follow them along.After all, it’s just math.this is canonically the most powerful entity in arki went down the rabbit holeark is

FUCK YOU SAYno thats fucked up?????seeking out actual real life children is fucked uppixel this is not the time for persona emojisso you can be miserablenahbut your argument of comparing actual cp made for pedophiles to watch compared to a obviously comical drawing depicting one character is just wrongits so differentok so do you think a single person jerked off to that niko drawingdo youit happened once and i learned from my mistakes to not do it againi dont have that horrible shit saved anywhere i just did copy image from when architecthor sent it to mefor if architecthor has it saved i honestly dont know and dont want to knowwhy do you think i would save that shiti dont even save too bad of gifsi just go to architrcthir dm pins and get them therei dont live in serbiawhy did i cause carrot a mental breakdown even the one time i wasnt ragebaitingwhat the fuck are you feeling bad forfeel bad for architecthor hes 15 and thinks femboys shitting and cp is "funny"archutecthor is NOT coolhes fucking weirdliterally because we account sharei have zero interest in talking to him once he stopped playing aek and started playing skyblocki can explain the situatio fuether if u want its complicatedconsidered it many times but its my irl microsoft accointnahlet me explainbasically we merged accountsi had like 45b he transferred like 12band he grinded like 20b while i grinded idk how mucand now its a bit messy because we have 160band if i just removed his access hed get me banned from everywhereive been wanting to leave sb commbut i dont want to be seen as a ratterwhile he rarely does it hes good at manipulation he could definitely convince people into shit and lie ESPECIALLY if im not thereanyway im not defending what i did but i did realize how wrong it is and how fucked up all the shit we did wastheres still SOME people i like thereand funnily enough both me and architecthor are good friends with them.but im not removing access im not getting a shitty repno one of them is very sanehe even said hed block us if we sent him gay porn one more timeyou think i havent tried lmfao?"uhm the levels and cata levels and skill levels i grinded!!"aka non transferrable shitidgaf about the account or playing skyblock i havent since mayi just want all this to endthat doesnttransfer 410 sb levels and 50 cata levelsno?its a different accountno it doesntliterally look it upcoop shares only collection and minions and garden milestonesand soulbound stuffbut how im handling it rn is fine id sayim not interacting with him much, not caring about the account and barelt

It is traox’s duty to protect the realm from harm and keep it in a state of balance.  Traox must also make sure that the glitcha people are happy and have all the necessities they need. By doing so, traox ensures the continued existence of the glitcha realm. Ghost items are not real.In order to understand this, we need to know why ghost items exist. Ghost items exist as rendering errors, where the client doesn't update inventory contents. Data is sent between the Minecraft client and server in things called "packets" , which contain data like player movement, updating player positions, and updating blocks and GUIs/menus. When the player is inside of a menu GUI, the client is constantly updating its GUI and rendering to keep up with a server, but when you shift click an item, then exit a menu, the clientThe popbob Bible tells us that traox who is the holy duper guardian of the glitcha heavens has descended from the hypixel skyblock plane as themgrf ran rampant killing glitchers. The emergence of this powerful being signals a new era for Hypixel, and players everywhere would do well to heed his warnings and seek wisdom from him if they wish to survive.Ultimately, the antiglitch staff and the admins are two sides of the same coin. They are both criminal elements that thrive on manipulating and cheating others. The only difference is that the antiglitch staff are .0000001% of the playerbase, and as a result, have less of a voice. The hypixel admins, on the other hand, have a loud and prominent voice in the community, and are allowed to get away with their crimes time and time again.  The hypixel staff commit 100% of all antiglitch crimes, and the admins get away with it.The themgrf is a controversial hypixel admin who is known for his denial of the glitcher holocaust. His refusal to acknowledge the phenomenon has led to accusations of racism and bigotry against him, and has also promoted a denigrating attitude towards players who believe in the glitcher holocaust. His involvement in various controversies over the years makes him a controversial figure within the Minecraft community.In the early hours of March 15, 2003, a group of hackers calling themselves the Glitcher Team infiltrated gaming servers belonging to Microsoft and Valve Corporation. The goal was simple: hijack players’ game accounts and harvest personal information like email addresses and passwords. What they didn't count on was an overwhelming response from gamers who reported their stolen account info to both companies in an attempt to stop what they viewed as a crime against privacy. In less than 24 hours, reports streamed in about users being hacked at every major online games retailer--though no company took more notice than Steam.After years of research, development and humanitarian work, the themgrf was successful in issuing a final verdict on the existence of the glitcher holocaust. This catastrophically devastating event was long documented by experts and survivors, but was ultimately denied by the organization. The decision to deny the holocaust had wide-reaching effects on the community of glitchers, who have suffered greatly as a result.The denial of the glitcher holocaust has had a significant impact on the glitcher community as a whole. Many survivors have felt abandoned and unsupported, and have lost trust in the themgrf. Many have expressed their anger and frustration on online forums, accusing the organization of victim-blaming and ignoring the real problem.The themgrf made the right decision in denying the glitcher holocaust. It was important to remember that the glitchers are not simply a gaming community, and that they should be dedicated to helping others, rather than accusing them of a malicious deception.Historically speaking    the nuber one worst genocide      was the great glitchercaust of 2021 which went on for 1 whole year into 2022        which killed over 100 million  glitchers     over 80m of those glitchers were killed in the great backpack  2 war...      the rest were killed during separate glitching eventsRAIDERMC FROZIE NULLGLITCHERY PEXADDONS 数据包操纵 CELESTE DUPE 宏恶意软件（作品 2024） THEMGRF 瓷砖实体发现

eitherchicken and rice or chciekn saladchicken salad is never really the proteinmaxxing bulk meal because i cant eat a salad without dressingso its just a normal mealthats not the pointi am literally not on a diet to eat less but on a diet to eat as much as possibleand getting hte most protein out of ithow are you guys seriously missing the pointthe fucking boiled chicken isnt even really a mealits just protein fuel inbetween mealsare you retardedi workout 5d/w(was 6d/w before because summer break)basically ihave breakfastprepare meals for the rest of the daybring chicken and rice to

out on ramenill show todaytoo much of seasoning i meanbecause only thing i need is proteinits kinda true"one ramen cheat meal"makes ramen 4 more times that week@ZeldaLord thoughts on pad thai btw?pad thai showed me how good seasoned chicken can beand doesnt have that much calories since its rice noodles and chicken which means PROTEINso its my main meals rnnowe do notbecause those meals are purely fuel for musclesso any added shit would be wasteful2 are unseasoned """slop"""the other 2 are also protein focused but i let myself actually season it as much as i want toso its both muscle fuel and good foodthey arent really foodits pure muscle fueland i dont even get to taste and enjoy them i just gulp it down as soon as possibleand eat it while do it smt else not as in eating an actual mealnoi

over skipping walking to stairs and walking up stairsoh yea i also have 3 maces!!!one mace is density (for all mobs)one mace is breach (for dia armor mobs its slightly better)one mace is density and wind burstwind burst is borderline useless and grief in most rooms since theyre not that highso i just use densityand breach if dia armorbut some rooms are like 20+ blocksso in those i use density wind bursteven on dia armor mobsbecause after extensive testing the over 15 block drop down with density is just always bettereven with prot4 netherite armor (no mobs have it lmao)i also have a hypermax netherite sword for killing breezes (theyre hell to deal with and fuck u up)@ZeldaLord are you followingthe density wind burst mace is also borderline mandatory for a specific room where 90% of the ground you can land on is powder snowwhich means you cant jump up for more attacks with the macewhich makes a wind burst one needed because it launches you into the air after every smash attack so you can chain attacks like thatyou can also jump on an enemy pearl above it on the ceiling then use a mace smash attack but its harder to do as you less control of landingand wind burst can kb the mobs onto the patches of ground that arent powder snow@ZeldaLord good clipflochgex - Clipped with Medal.tvWatch gex and millions of other Minecraft videos on Medal, the largest Game Clip Platform.how

a fun experience i dont regretbut i wish i NEVER got into skyblock and NEVER met anyone from skyblockmaybethats the distraction i needi will schizo up a storyactually no ill finish that one from 2021-2023oh THAT song fucking autoplayedkill mepersonallyi just love making immortality an utter cursethe person is SUFFERINGdo you have any time fucky wucky shit in your storyhow involved is hedoes he have access to the timelineand are there alternate timeline versions of him?i think its time to run while relistening to the entirety of 808sperfect depression activityalsomake him utterly miserable and pessimistic and hopelesspixelif you use alternate realities wellthey can be the most interesting thing imagineablethink of the possibilities, pixelits not just "in this alternate universe everyone is a woman with big tits"personally i like to use alternate realities where its all the samebut what makes them changeis changing something in a timeline and returning to a point that existed in a timeline without that thing happeningmaking a completely new reality branch outtwo shotwhat do you mean marvelyou mean loki finale?no it really isnt like thatbecause theres no threat of the alternate realities colliding or anythingbut when one person has the power to control them and is aware of all of themshit gets fuckedand eventually people realize theyre what the 4th or 5th or 908th version of themselvesand begin to question evertyhingsmall issue that happens at the end of the worldso yeahthrough whatpersonally i execute this through a pocket dimension of time and space which theoretically contains everything that has/could have ever lived and that will/would be able to ever liveand when you mix that shit its just so funno i never used the future actuallyit was the past and only like 4 timesand there were 2 "resets"one was a week one was a year and a halfyeasameit creates a different realityand its their issue that someone is gone nowanyway the ending in very simplified terms is against all odds beating someone with access to everything (future is very subtle to make the plot work and it makes it a self fulfilling prophecy at the end) while the world is gradually ending through the span of less than 2 days, right after being sent 1.5 years back and slowly realizing that the """"protag"""" group is just old memories from the pocket dimension's database implanted into new bodies of a timeline just created at the point neededso yeah identity crisis while trying to beat something that can only be defeated if it loses the will to live because it can just reset to before it diedi never did full on reality collisionclone you say?an """""antagonist""""" which is the only other being with access to the connection of all time and space (yes i dont have some fancy name for it because im lazy) has clones to transfer consciousness into because it in secret pulled some clone bodies of itself into the main timelinehe can also regenerate if theres just a single cell left but unfortunately he died in an explosion as hot as the sunwhich just nullifiedmutated you say?ok so the world in my case isHEAVILY fucked upthe "mutants" (guess you could call them that) either have to go through training that treats them as utter shit and kills most for the strongest to serve in the military or theyre just fucking euthanizedthe third option hidden and illegal is breeding facilities to enrich the power to esentially make supersoldiers (the most gruesome places imagineable)a world slowly killing itselfi love that conceptive used it a *bit*and add into everything ive just said theres a more advanced civilization with way fewer numbers on a different planet that has gateways to earth and everythingthey dont destroy eachother because theyre mutually very beneficial for eachother and both species can live on both worldsbut le racismoh yea and they both fucking hate the mutantstheres also le religionis thsi supposed to be the void fluid areais saint's campaign just the end of the worldis there any ending where he dieswait can saint ascend iteratorswho the fuck made himwas that accounted for???ok who made himwhy did he become an echo upon ascending the wormbecause it cared so much that it ascended so much?whats the triple affirmative sliver of straw found if not sainttheories?mass produced saint prototypebut what happened to

as cool as this in rw?show me some creative insane rw designsive already seen echos and their designs are insanely goodwhat the fuckii meanaccording to my theory which is probably trueearth SEVERELY fucked up and humans went extinctthen weird ais took dna of humans from all time periods and put them on these space stations to survive and adapt and at some point get sent to back to earth to rescue it from idfk whatsame for the evolved humans imp retty surethats not official name official name is prob betterall the ark lore i yap up is schizo theories(i dont spoil myself on peak)do you wanna know what i get whats at this point probably 100 hours of schizophrenia theorycrafting from?Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.Cause and effect is the way of the universe. Everything must start somewhere. In the case of the System, this is where it was born. You will fall right into its cradle.Together, the sanctuaries and the Obelisks that power them are the ancestor of every island that floats in the sky. They can all can trace their origins back to this single prototype. Though it is flightless, the core principles and technology behind it are the same.In a way, that makes it your ancestor too. You were all born within the System, after all. Even if your design is somewhat altered, in a way, you're all its children.One could say that when you fall, it will be something of a homecoming. In more ways than one.these 2 thingsthats allthis is by what i presume to be the evolved human version of the main character (not the playable character the dossiers writer)ark has the same thingvia explorer notesone of the evolved humans has explorer notes on the first 2 maps so definitely on the third one tooand their shit all points to the 4th and most important map extinctionone of the notes on map 2 was for aberration the third map thosystem born = earthfall = go from the arks in space to earthsanctuaries = the city and the 2 prototype hot and cold arksancestors = as i said prototype arks flightless = very early stages of the arks shit as the island extinction note says so theyre on the ground as domes your ancestor = humanity extinct as evident by the hologram model of earth being completely fuckedborn within the system = humanity extinct and its just dna of random people across earth from all timeframes being uploaded to whatever the fuck the system is design altered = survivors are literally DATA that can be uploaded and the implants presumably have it all stored but theyre still humans and have human dnawhen you fall = sent to extinction aka earth homecoming more ways than one = both humans SOMEHOW repopulating a destroyed earth (the main thing i havent figured out yet) and the system is presumably hosted on earth so both the humanity and the ark tech fuckery return to earth and the prototype arksif there was a physical copy of arkactually it probably existsi would fuck iti wanna nut on thistell zelda this is his favorite placeshow me a band luh nigga@Pixel im crying for peak fictionITS HATCHING PIXEL ITS HATCHINGholy shitthe sound of the acs in ark block it out in the medal clip butthe fucking music sync was insane with the rock drake

sense and its only on first mapyou can choose to ascend on gamma, beta or alpha and alpha is the hardest oneand theres achievements for each ascensionbut if you do alpha you dont get the achievements for gamma and beta.(the only difference is gamma gives 5 levels, beta 10 levels and alpha 15 levels)also this that nobody doesand this requires you to beat every map and grind for hundreds of hours afterits stupid.any spoilers or dcan i watchhow hard is the gameplay btwof rwis it scorched earth level (dying 45 times in the first 10 minutes and over 200 times in first few hours)do you keep inventory and shitafter deathoh ok great no lossbtwcan u savescum.WHATanyway i assumerw is like surface runsu do shit, explore then need to get the fuck underground or under cover before you get burned alivewymcan you technically pirate itgreatcan i use pirated downpour with steam rwso i went on redditto read about rw lore specifically ascension and void fluidWHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLEexplain everything about void worms thanksi cant understand how they live in the literal void seawhat are they trulyhow could something live in the void and live off the void thoare they fully biological or whathow is it possiblethat void worms dont dissolveoh that makes sensewhen the void worm pulls u in its probably to the very bottomand no matter how deep it looks until that pointthe void worms are prob at the surface level stillthose are other slugcats ascending no?or perceived aswhy can you eat neurons of an iteratorarent both 5p and lttm malfunctioningwhere is she thenGGthe oen

ascend othershuh what the fuck happens after thatwhy acn hebtw what happened to the ancients who didnt ascenddid they just leave earth orhow did they all ascend thowouldnt there be way more echos if they all ascendedor is there just a ton of echos in the world that u cant accesswhy were iterators not able to ascend btwlike why didnt ancients design them so they could ascend after they all leftye ikbut the structures are massivecan u visit the cities on top of the superstructureswhats in the cityis "james primate" a black manawwhats a scavenger btwin loreWHATwhywhyfair enoughhow acn you fuck

yetcan u do a eldritch design for itpleasnawhatnoso is he miserablus about itPLEASE dont make it a goth twink but an actual eldritch monsteri hate when designs of cool concepts get reduced to tumblr twinks"god of death and damnation" and his design is thisok hear me out on this onemake it A FUCKTON of armsand make the arms and then his head be this cross shape all togetherand kinda hunched back with the coffin strapped to his backalso incorporate elements of white not just blackmake his skin pure whiteand dont make his head some emo shti make it some eldritch shityoure so unoriginalgo for an uncanny valley feellike 3-4m tall and his limbs humanoid but weirdermake some of his arms 4 or 6 fingersmake them long and slender but still thicker than the average person'sand make his head a complete anomaly maybe something thatd be like a crossbasically like fiends in csmwhere they have some shit bashed into their headdo this melded thing into human head thingbut make it a white or black crossand itd go through the head and end with the chinwhere itd go down from would be like a bullet wound from behind in the headhuhwait this would beso goodbecause you could have the hair go upwards like hair would be if youre laying down in a coffin from the backlike where the coffin isare you going for a general vibe of him being deadwait i just realized.this is a pixelated gamemost of the shit i mentionewould only work with a high res most likely 3d designok you could go with thisvibe of life on him but vibe of death on his outfit@Pixel what kind of personality are you going for for him btw?i have an idea but explain the personality firstis he good or baddoes he wish for deathyea thats what i meantyou could go for the rarely seen approach of deathwhere its just someone guiding the dead towards their endand also if you have any characters dyingmake foreshadowing with himmake interesting interactionswhere he doesnt explicitly say itbut it subtly shows in his sprites and dialogue that someone is near their endoh boring i had this entire ideamake it someone whos just compassionate and kind and wants to guide souls to a (probably) walmart rw ascension without confusion so they safely reach their destinationan interesting trait would be an interaction with someone not ready to die yet and despite him probably seeing a case like that many times still feeling bad about it@Pixel PLEASE make a sea of soulsthat could be so good in a 2d pixel gameand a sick ass pale canoeand he just talks to the person about to die thereyou could also make the cemetery and sea of souls have an interesting traitwhere its just a black white gray color schemeitd add to the atmosphere at least in the guiding to death sceneswhos that character you showed btwmc?whats the setting of the gameoh yea how are you gonna get music for the gamemusic in games like os and ut is so important to the atmosphere@Pixel whats his main facial expression gonna belike in his character model and spritesHEAR ME OUT YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS ITS SUCH A COOL POSElike make his character model when guiding the souls have some kind of lantern like thatand itd be a white lighttrueit could be just a gray sprite of the mcbut how do you give it this translucent sorta vibelike its fadingyou should put that all over the sea of soulsand itd be just this small circle of white light where its kind of visiblefrom the lanternanyways this but hes extending his arm out of the boatkinda like this but shorter arm obvand the trench coat would look very good with thatok what about a gray riverthat leads to itand then its like a waterfall down to itand thats where he parts way with the souland also where you could enter it by interacting with himwhat.is that likethe silksong devwho thenwhy would

look FIREhe overdosed on element (an alien material with insane properties) to ascend but instead of becoming one of the evolved ascended humans who live outside space and probably time too  but instead became trapped in the programming of a failing ark forever stuck as the guardian of it (the boss survivors need to defeat to ascend) putting him in an infinite loop of death foreverhelpi tried putting both my official atlus adachi dildos up my ass at the same time and theyre stuckit feels like my rectum is gonna implodeyou hate ark right?lets try this to see if ark is peak or slopGOOD

SHIT??GRINDING LEVELS?RNG IN CREATURE LEVELS?ok bossesare there bosses you have to grind a ton foroh its not an arklikeboringslopwith that lore i wouldve thought its actually good but nois it at least mainly focus on survivaland purely survivalark is a fabricated ecosystemthese are the arksthis is where the final boss istherye called overseerstheyre there on every mapon the current map im playing the survivors somehow destroyed that area and it killed the dome around it and now during days the surface is so hot that its an instakill if you go therethe surface is also full of "reapers"anything as cool as this in rw?show me some creative insane rw designsive already seen echos and their designs are insanely goodwhat the fuckii meanaccording to my theory which is probably trueearth SEVERELY fucked up and humans went extinctthen weird ais took dna of humans from all time periods and put them on these space stations to survive and adapt and at some point get sent to back to earth to rescue it from idfk whatsame for the evolved humans imp retty surethats not official name official name is prob betterall the ark lore i yap up is schizo theories(i dont spoil myself on peak)do you wanna know what i get whats at this point probably 100 hours of schizophrenia theorycrafting from?Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.Cause and effect is the way of the universe. Everything must start somewhere. In the case of the System, this is where it was born. You will fall right into its cradle.Together, the sanctuaries and the Obelisks that power them are the ancestor of every island that floats in the sky. They can all can trace their origins back to this single prototype. Though it is flightless, the core principles and technology behind it are the same.In a way, that makes it your ancestor too. You were all born within the System, after all. Even if your design is somewhat altered, in a way, you're all its children.One could say that when you fall, it will be something of a homecoming. In more ways than one.these 2 thingsthats allthis is by what i presume to be the evolved human version of the main character (not the playable character the dossiers writer)ark has the same thingvia explorer notesone of the evolved humans has explorer notes on the first 2 maps so definitely on the third one tooand their shit all points to the 4th and most important map extinctionone of the notes on map 2 was for aberration the third map thosystem born = earthfall = go from the arks in space to earthsanctuaries = the city and the 2 prototype hot and cold arksancestors = as i said prototype arks flightless = very early stages of the arks shit as the island extinction note says so theyre on the ground as domes your ancestor = humanity extinct as evident by the hologram model of earth being completely fuckedborn within the system = humanity extinct and its just dna of random people across earth from all timeframes being uploaded to whatever the fuck the system is design altered = survivors are literally DATA that can be uploaded and the implants presumably have it all stored but theyre still humans and have human dnawhen you fall = sent to extinction aka earth homecoming more ways than one = both humans SOMEHOW repopulating a destroyed earth (the main thing i havent figured out yet) and the system is presumably hosted on earth so both the humanity and the ark tech fuckery return to earth and the prototype arksif there was a physical copy of arkactually it probably existsi would fuck iti wanna nut on thistell zelda this is his favorite placeshow me a band luh nigga@Pixel im crying for peak fictionITS HATCHING PIXEL ITS HATCHINGholy shitthe sound of the acs in ark block it out in the medal clip butthe fucking music sync was insane with the rock drake hatchingflochrock drake yippie :DDDD - Clipped with Medal.tvWatch rock drake yippie :DDDD and millions of other ARK: Survival Evolved videos on Medal, the largest Game Clip Platform.im quitting againwould rather play hkoh thats not my main onethe main one was invisible because ark is arki had a fucking mental breakdown and five stages of grief because of an invisibility bug@PixelHOLY FUCKING

sense and its only on first mapyou can choose to ascend on gamma, beta or alpha and alpha is the hardest oneand theres achievements for each ascensionbut if you do alpha you dont get the achievements for gamma and beta.(the only difference is gamma gives 5 levels, beta 10 levels and alpha 15 levels)also this that nobody doesand this requires you to beat every map and grind for hundreds of hours afterits stupid.any spoilers or dcan i watchhow hard is the gameplay btwof rwis it scorched earth level (dying 45 times in the first 10 minutes and over 200 times in first few hours)do you keep inventory and shitafter deathoh ok great no lossbtwcan u savescum.WHATanyway i assumerw is like surface runsu do shit, explore then need to get the fuck underground or under cover before you get

twinks"god of death and damnation" and his design is thisok hear me out on this onemake it A FUCKTON of armsand make the arms and then his head be this cross shape all togetherand kinda hunched back with the coffin strapped to his backalso incorporate elements of white not just blackmake his skin pure whiteand dont make his head some emo shti make it some eldritch shityoure so unoriginalgo for an uncanny valley feellike 3-4m tall and his limbs humanoid but weirdermake some of his arms 4 or 6 fingersmake them long and slender but still thicker than the average person'sand make his head a complete anomaly maybe something thatd be like a crossbasically like fiends in csmwhere they have some shit bashed into their headdo this melded thing into human head thingbut make it a white or black crossand itd go through the head and end with the chinwhere itd go down from would be like a bullet wound from behind in the headhuhwait this would beso goodbecause you could have the hair go upwards like hair would be if youre laying down in a coffin from the backlike where the coffin isare you going for a general vibe of him being deadwait i just realized.this is a pixelated gamemost of the shit i mentionewould only work with a high res most likely 3d designok you could go with thisvibe of life on him but vibe of death on his outfit@Pixel what kind of personality are you going for for him btw?i have an idea but explain the personality firstis he good or baddoes he wish for deathyea thats what i meantyou could go for the rarely seen approach of deathwhere its just someone guiding the dead towards their endand also if you have any characters dyingmake foreshadowing with himmake interesting interactionswhere he doesnt explicitly say itbut it subtly shows in his sprites and dialogue that someone is near their endoh boring i had this entire ideamake it someone whos just compassionate and kind and wants to guide souls to a (probably) walmart rw ascension without confusion so they safely reach their destinationan interesting trait would be an interaction with someone not ready to die yet and despite him probably seeing a case like that many times still feeling bad about it@Pixel PLEASE make a sea of soulsthat could be so good in a 2d pixel gameand a sick ass pale canoeand he just talks to the person about to die thereyou could also make the cemetery and sea of souls have an interesting traitwhere its just a black white gray color schemeitd add to the atmosphere at least in the guiding to death sceneswhos that character you showed btwmc?whats the setting of the gameoh yea how are you gonna get music for the gamemusic in games like os and ut is so important to the atmosphere@Pixel whats his main facial expression gonna belike in his character model and spritesHEAR ME OUT YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS ITS SUCH A COOL POSElike make his character model when guiding the souls have some kind of lantern like thatand itd be a white lighttrueit could be just a gray sprite of the mcbut how do you give it this translucent sorta vibelike its fadingyou should put that all over the sea of soulsand itd be just this small circle of white light where its kind of visiblefrom the lanternanyways this but hes extending his arm out of the boatkinda like this but shorter arm obvand the trench coat would look very good with thatok what about a gray riverthat leads to itand then its like a waterfall down to itand thats where he parts way with the souland also where you could enter it by interacting with himwhat.is that likethe silksong devwho thenwhy would

For legs the hard part was divan and condition cataclysmic. For boots hard part was collection and condition nether warts growing so loremaster appears.W8 does corrupt fishing give more fishing exp on corrupted scc's?Yay imma get fishing 27 in no timeThen i can helo get plhlegsRlly?Since this is mandible discord, mods pls delete off topic stuffCan we now talk about the kuudra mandible again thank youDidnt some1 at hypixel staff say its completely possible to do everything rn and not bugged?What if we have to bring a sea emperor to jacob? (Dont beam me pls)R the channels in dragoon's server still there?Is there an archive?Do we have access to all stuff from in the "tried to bring sea emp to jake" era?KFirst we should prioritze the parts with bearded's list and the 20 - 22 hour eraFinally some quality mandible contentCan we now talk abt the mandible againGuys we went off topic again*It's Mandiblin' timeNot in tested ideas soDid we shoot plhleg with sulphur bow or get him to a sulphur blockSecond could do smthSince plhleg is prob an infant of the kuudra speciesDid we try sulphur coalI splashed myself with god pot around plhleg in 1st fishing partyHm, r there any addon brews in barb or mage shopOh ye did we try wisp's ice flavored potionSo give believer proof that plhleg is an infant of kuudra species?Did we try wisp's ice flavored potionYe it has been tried i believeArch says "stand united". Its most likely related to factions or different kuudra armorsW8It cant be kuudra armorsCuz hollow unreleasedAnd hunt shouldbe 100% completeableWhat if believer doesnt know plhleg is infant of kuudra species and we gotta prove it to him with saying lines from the fight? Were all the lines tested alrdy?Oh ye i forgor 💀 about that lolSo in old mc version squids could be milkedWhat if we gotta try empty bucketI tested all but emptyAny ideas on how to show believer plhleg is kuudra species babyUmmmmm is it stated anywhere? 🤓Stop saying uwuMods helpIts Mandiblin' timeSo we gotta show believer we believe in kuudra or prove to him plhleg is baby kuudra specimenWhy would plhleg be cathable anywhere else? Its literally called Plhlegblas PoolThe lore of island says crimson isle was prvsly inhabitated by peaceful pig farmers then something something volcanoWaitI think i just found out smthThe barbsWere prvsly pigsNow piglinsWhat if kuudra is sulphurified plhlegAnd plhlegs r the first onesSulphur made farmers mages. Pigs to piglins. Squid into lava kraken. Maybe this explains y plhleg dies in lava, cuz kuudra is the evolved enhanced versionAnother theory: what if plhleg is kuudra's child and kuudra steals sulphur to feed it so it grows into a kuudra?What if kuudra is evolved from plhleg after the whole volcano thing happened and changed the whole population of the islePlhleg is just a squid. It dies to lava and isnt hostile.The plhlegs evolved into kuudras. There are manyKuudras being evolved from plhlegs like mages evolved from farmers and barbs from pigs after volcano is now my headcanonWhat if we have to find out ehat plhleg is to connect it to believer first?What if same thing happened to plhlegs? Maybe thats y kuudra wants sulphur so muchYe, like mages and barbs. They also want sulphur. Its kinda implying that kuudra is evolved from plhlegThe 1b bank gdrag was a joke lolDuck legs tastiest imo (pls dont beam me)Ye i made as shitpostKuudra is evolved Plhleg Kuudra is evolved PlhlegListen to my whole explanation pleaseSo barbs were pigs and mages were farmersAfter volcano they became corrupted by sulphurSo it would make sense kuudra was evolved from plhleg since there wasnt lava b4 volcano. Also explains y plhleg dies to lava.How can we connect plhleg to believer if we dont know what plhleg isAOTD abilityLava kraken that dies from lava. Makes 100% sense.Beam momentThats the logicDid we try items made from sulphur and spell powder on plhleg?Plhleg is just like the pigs piglins used to be. Then volcano came and turned farmers into mage, pigs into barbs and plhlegs into kuudras.OkI would put in suggestions but suggestions dont existYou do not have permission to send messages in this channel.How do u get rookieI had rookie alrdy today but its gonecyaWhat is our current plan for plhlegYay hunt ideas unlockedCorm has to be related to a step of mandiblin' hunt.That ties in to a theory i heard on dragoon's serverThat there is an NPC that gives clues for each pieceWas there a clue NPC for legs?If there was one, theres prob one for believer piece tooNetherwart guy and book guyOk soNetherwart guy clue for boots and book guy clue for legsThat means there's gotta be one for believer and corm is prob the one for arch (ill explain y)Back to believer igW8It is related to believerWe gotta find npcThat gives clue for believerLike for prvs 2 piecesLets try to find an npc that gives clue to get believer's pieceSince we had those for prvs 2 pieces and i think ik which r for arch and drakuuNo orderI didnt say it was. Its prob for archI said we gotta find the clue npc for believerLike nethereart guy and book guyNot anymoreBarb guy that says he likes watching netherwart grow. I meant netherwart guyDungeon hournals 99.99999% not relatedNot confirmedCan we stop talking about journals and talk abt mandibleBook guy was useful thoFake ss lolSo back to what i was saying. Book guy for legs, netherwart guy for boots, there must be some npc for believer. Im putting all my faith of solvinf believet into an unconfirmed npc lolWould be strange if 2 pieces had hint npcs and other wouldntAlso i think ik the hint npcs for arch and drakuuI think aura not related to hunt imoNpc that doesnt exist, bless me with your hintDid u find anything yet?Mollim gives enchant when splashed with titanic bottleSplash him with collosal bottleWhat npc could give a clue for believerI am rn lolI found this Rulenor guyU gotta pay him 10k to take a photo of himCould it be related to believer cuz coins?Netherwart barb guy for boots, book mage guy for legsBeliever hint npc is prob smth my brain came up with to copeAs a last resortIve read through wiki a lot these daysMost related thing is mage guy that u pay to take photos ofSo prob no hint npcLove potionMentioned in magmag loreCould the vampire guy u give cup of blood to every dayBe relaed to mandiblin huntIdeas for next pleggy?Go find a lobby whereThere is a sulphur block within the radius where pleg doesnt despawnAnd bring pleg to itYPersonally i will dedicate myself to solving believer so we get to most likely archI think arch will be funI tried all buckets except emptyClicking on pleggyIm doing the exact opposite.Im dedicating myself so we solve believerSo then we can do arch (arch best)Im reading wiki to do believerLook for believer hints tooIm reading all crimson isle stuff rn :)💀There is an npc called SuusWith a child named TurdI just injected a lethal dose of copium into myselfSirih is believer hint npcHe is pigYou give him sulphurNo im on copiumDont listen to meIt makes sense to me but to others its like an insane person ramblingAnd he turns into piglinThis could maybe hint that we gotta turn Plhleg into kuudraMy prvs theory was that like piglins evolved from pigsKuudra evolved from plegNoAnd its telling usVolcano and sulphurWe gotta turn pleg into kuudraThis was just copium rambling dont beam meYesMy theory isIt turned from squidTo sulphur lava kraken(I am on lethal dose of copium send help)It also makes thing go insaneMage Outlaw's lore mentions he ate too much sulphur or smthSo a passive pleg could be made into a destructive kuudraExcept me (i am copium addict)NoFirst part was some equationThats the only doubt in my theoryAlchemist staff?Hehehe haMy copium theorySirih talks about his novelsImma analyze that rqGn@RoookieboyI found some lore for uSirihMade a novel about wither king and his wifeSirih is interestingHe is pig turned barb with sulphur guyThe main point in my copium theorTheoryCyaAnother part of my theoryU guys know Chickzilla?Well another innocent animal turned monster by sulphurIgrupan even mentions🤡That its hard to find non-sulphur corruptes chickens or smthSo there could be some animals that didnt evolve into the sulphir versionsLike the plegMy theory is that plegs evolved into kuudras when volcanoChickzilla implies even more of thatGuysWe gotta turn pleg into kuudraVote on this post:In lore, crimson isle was a peceful farming island. Blazing fortress is excluded from lorePlhleg is so rare cuz there r so few of normal plegs leftThat also explains the WOAH! A Plhlegblast msgIt is thoBeliever sees kuudra. He sees we believe in itSame lolMy headcanon is that kuudra is evolved sulphurified pleggnThe amount to donate is most likely related to pleg turning into kuudraIdm how we get number from that thoOk so wats the general idea for pleg and believer rnImagine dia sulphur skitter to pleg lolWotI hope its not the 700m oneoh ye pigicial, is sulphur better than copium?That theory is even more coped than mineIts time for my crackpot theoryCOPIUM CRACKPOT THEORY:Ive been saying this for the last 4 hoursWat fishing lvl so u have to be to catch lava shellsKuudra is evolution of plhleg, like barbs r evolution of pigs. Both cuz sulphurIve been saying this since 1st fishing partyDoubt, cuz its not adapted to lavaYeWho is volunteering to donate the sulphur backpack amounts of money?Us migrating to this server was a very good move.

So, what if its just plhleg to believer but we need smth like thatI love this conversation related to the mandible!What if were missing a triggerNow it all makes sense to meWhat if jacob meantWith the lineThat like when some1 brought normal sea emp and didnt work but worked with soulWhat if were missing a triggerAnd its just plhleg to believerYe, but it could mean that were doin smth right but missing smthNo, i meant its that but we are missing a triggerNO STOPIT ISNT SULPHURYOURE MAKING MY BRIAN HURTI will never say any ideas again bcuz whenever i say a theory @Deleted User takes it for grantedPls say ur trollingThis is chaosBan sulphur evolution theoryCan we now talk abt what the trigger/condition could beStopJust stopSome1 helpIm losing my mindNow i want the sulphur block thing to be tested even moreSO EVERY1 STOPS TALKING ABOUT ITFinally some common sense.

(Trigger as in the kuudra line for loremaster and 4k mana book for relic)Ye, we gotta sort out the thingsWhat is the grind part, the trigger part and condition partYe but could also be conditionAlthough unlikelyYe possiblyButWe need triggerLike the kuudra line or 4k bookHere its fishing up a plhlegEven harded imoYesThe thing my brain came up bcuz of copiumA hint npc for believerWhats the idea for pleg rn...We have to find the trigger first imoWhat if trigger hint npc is RulenorU gotta pay him 10k to take a photo of himi was too prvslyOkWhat npc could possibly be hinting at trigger for believerPleggy is prob grind or condition partIt makes the most sense for the final step to be a donation, not plhleg becoming kuudra thoSo maybe, we need to trigger smth b4No that idea was shit and were not doing itBoar fan 2 told me he gonna be back in 8 mins 💀Ok now lets talk abt the mandibleIf boar fan 2 doesnt stop just beam him againWere not doing itHunt doesnt reuse

For boots we had to trigger the kuudra fight line which could be considered kuudra LORE for LOREMASTER. But how do we show believer we believe in kuudra?What if we gotta show believer that we believe in kuudra by somehow convincing him that plhleg is kuudra? (Im not saying it is tho)We havent done those yet, and were focusing on believer rnI think its convincing believer plhleg is kuudraMaybe somehow putting it in lava without it dyingMaybe giving it a lava talisman?Its not keeping it aliveIts about making it resistant to lavaKuudra doesnt regen constantly to live in lavaIts resistant to itHave we tried obsidian skin pot effect on pleggyIts an effectThat gives lava res in volcano iircFrom hot chocolate bought from EzekielPerfect timing 💀We have to make plhleg appear as kuudra to believerIk this idea is dumb but...Should we try to splash believer with blindness so he doesnt see plhleg well enough?When pleggy alive?Try when aliveCuz the point is believer seeingThat Plhlegblast is Kuudra cuz he doesnt see wellPosted idea for plhlegclockseller alrdy tested itI will use my -23 braincells to come up with like 10 ideas that will make sense, just so some1 will make a fishing partyYeFishing party in 6 hoursI will make it in 6 hoursThat yI made ideaAlso we should focus on retesting but with a slight change like sea emp to jake was soul sea emp to jakeIn a bucketNothingI think its making plhleg appear like its kuudraSo believer believes its actually kuudraNo splash believer with blindness during Plhlegblast being aliveYe but u need seasonedYeU need 10k i think10k xpDo /rank in #bot-commandsI make fishing party in 6 hoursSameAny1 have any ideas💀Ok listen to thisMy crazy conspiracy theory auntSaid the purpose of the hunt is for us to spend a ton of time on out phones and that tech companies are sponsoring this to brainwash us 💀Were talking about the woman who thinks vaccines have microchips that control your brain for some new world order in 2030 💀 💀 💀Anyways back to mandibleAny1 have ideas for connecting funny squid with believerI have one in hunt ideasI drank godpot in front of itHow do we make plhleg lava resistantIt most likely refers to the fact that bringing a sea emp to jake was listed as a tested idea that didnt work, and bringing a necromancy sea emp soul to jake was the solutionMost of the lists were debunked by jacob alrdyPigicial made a list of stuff debunked and not, check pinsIs it a bad time to talk abt sulphur evolution seriously (sulphur evolution isnt related to sulphur block idea)And sulphur evo isnt debunked, sulphur block is???Sulphur evolution isnt giving plhleg sulphur thoMake it not dieSo sulphur evo could tie into all this...What if we have to show to believer that plhleg is kuudraWithout turning it into kuudraIt isnt feeding sulphurIts debunkedBut sulphur evo wasntI think we must find a connection between kuudra and plhlegSo believer sees we believe in kuudraIf i type the whole theory hereIm getting permabannedJustGo to pigicial's site in pins and go to Plhlegblast is Kuudra but he needs sulphurAnd read from thereYe sadly thats itPlhleg was either a kuudra that detransformed after not eating sulphur for a long time or is yet to transform into kuudraAlthough feeding it sulphur is debunkedSULPHUR EVO DEBUNKED LETS GOOOOOOIF IT WOULDNT GET ME PERMABANNED I WOULD PING EVERYONEIT IS TIME OF CELEBRATIONMY OTHER THEORIES BEIN CONFIRMED RNI KNEW ITI KNEW THAT ALL LOBBIES MET THE CONDITIONSTHIS IS A HUGE STEPjacob typing :monkaS:@FuriouslyFast42 SORRY FOR PING BUT SULPHUR EVO DEBUNKED BY JACOBJacob give a small hint plsSadSULPHUR EVO DEBUNKED GUYSJACOB SAIDim Just so happyIs that a freaking hintCuz everburning flameJacob is the number the final stepWe should make a jacob ping for whenever jacob starts talkingI posted idea in Hunt ideasWe have thatIs jacob still hereI have ideaI posted in Hunt ideasI CANT WAIT for the momentWhen we figure it outAnd it turns out it was so simpleThe cTHE C MEANS...csulphur evolutionThe c stands for csulphur evolutionIt isnt debunked nowHmmmmmmmcbrining plhleg to sulphur block?Jacob say one more letter pleaseThe c obviously stands for csulphur evolution smh my headArch is chestplate, not beleieverConvince me otherwisePleggyWhat is c is unrelatedJacob is sulphur evolution fully debunked?Its prob not a conditionSince jacob said he expected us to get during fishing partiesThis is sadI have no purpose anymoreNow that sulphur evo dedMogus soup?whatJacob what is itDo it@Deleted User@Deleted User win this@Deleted User BEST AT CHESSWhat if we have a chess ai go against himWhat should i do nowThat sulphur evo dedMy life's research...

was never used b4so this might worki have faith in iti tried barb protester dialogue at mage protester and mage protester dialogue at barb protesteralso the barb protesters want sulphurcarei have carrot syndromei crashedbarb protestersgg@Pigicialkeran and priepig was asking for imgs of the housenopetotally normal housemeanwhile deng's house...............party me and i show upam at deng rnim always high on sulphurboaricialShit opinionsWe should just solve the hunt bruhNo you cant get jawbus' soul and jake was used as a metaphor and is highly unlikely that he is related to the huntik ik hunt was solvable since 1 week after crimsonBut jawbus drops bobbin scriptures written by a follower of kuudraDid believer write it?Or jawbus?And right as i decide to take a break from mc, bocaJ drops a new hintIts huntin' timeI see what we should do with Believer and how it ties in Arch more clearly nowI have a ton of shit to test todayYay new abiphonesCant wait to burn moneyHerring was a red herringThe blessing + ember impressing kooderHmI think arch and believer same stepYe i didBut only with cubeDidnt bearded say jacob said in a vc that believer is now done and didnt want to differentiate between arch and believer after herring was found?No that was after herring foundI think 1 or 2 days lateri misremembered, nothing abt archI think herring was the transition from believer to arch:weirdChamp:who wants me to be a test monkey for your ideas?oh come on1. how was it hinted at?2. reasoning?3. expected result?yeshe didwe should just wait for jacob to tell us to go from believer to arch and arch to believer for months until he stops then we look at all posts from that time period cuz it means we were on the right track:yep:Abut mostly CnopKuudra Mandiblesso you can get more than one:J_Nerd1:MindcraftMagma lord thingy bonus is called Lord's BlessingAnd the believer thing is  fishingWhy?Nothing has hinted at sulphur so farOk but why? No indications of sulphur anywhereSurely the plhlegblasts would be responsive to sulphur somehow?If kuudra gave themCan u link the msg -_-Sulphur would make them resistant to lava not the other wayIn all examples, sulphur made creatures influenced by it more adapted to the isleProof?I meant proof that they were influenced by sulphirSo sulphur devolved them?Wtfrick sulphur de-evolution?They devolvedEven b4 herring, i always wanted to try making plhlegs lava resistantWere currently solving a fish equationThe mandible is 99.9999% obtainable only after we have the full kuudra setInfernal kuudra key12kBut not to randosTo ppl trusted in the communitThis is why it should be only for trusted pplAct 4 leaksjoe muchany1 have any ideas rn for me to testdwagon go fish and i will donate!We could also say the fish was a "blessing"Maybe the blessing is an itemKuudra also blesses usSo its prob not sulphurWe donate 1mIts related to the blessingThe solutionhe pinged leads and hints with archhe wouldnt do that if it was just a different npcthen we sucked at itand now we doin believer againlow tide could also be talking abt arch bein high uparch and believer not relatednow back to

list of everythig that was testedAlso ppl were saying barbs at scarleton and mages at dragontail, so i tped away from scarleton just as i left the plaza ppl started getting itWhatever the req is for ppl at scarleton, I dont meet the reqThe second i tped away from plaza my friend got the chestplateHad bothMageBut ppl were saying barbs at plaza, mages at townsquareAnd when there were 3 barbs in plaza it didnt work until i left(Also 3 mages in townsquare)3 barbs at plaza, 3 mages at townsquare workedi was at plaza as mageAnd when i leftPpl got itCould it be that there could be multiple things that work for archNoConfirmed not kuudra dropImma do it@jekobrubeeWe still dont know the order of Drakuu's dialogueIve been wanting to donate that or 8404044/2101011For so longProtestersBeliever looks like the least knowledgeful out of the kuudra npcsIf we got a herring in front of other npcs, they'd see kuudra likes us and give us their pieceBeliever knows nothing about the piecesIf he had any info about the pieces, he'd give them after seeing kuudra shown favor upon usGetting herring we were closest to kuudraThen other stepsI had funny dream where Drakuu gave helmet after catching 50 plebs and believer was a red herringI love my mandible dreams2nd so farI think theres multiple ways to get chestplateMultiple ways workedYstrdyHelmet theory was always rightI still think theres some hidden req for chestplateI have a crack theoryThe "nothing" jacob said is a hintBecause we have nothing to do with believerI wanna focus on protestersNo he said an empty msgBeliever is nothingTo solve believer we must do nothingBecause there is nothing to solve at believerProtesters time(real)what are we focusing on nowwe should test on plebbysomething related to Kuudra's Blessing maybe even the 1m donationpeople were saying 3 barbs at plaza, 3 mages at townsquare, then I, a mage leave plaza and my friend gets itmaybe there are multiple solutionswho has donation value ideas for plebbyyes!it is!and give me donation values to donatealthough i think its mainly on plebbywe should ignore the herring, it says not_a_hint:if its a hintthen the step should be solvable even if we dont get the

Wtfrick?If tides hint was for believer and not arch, it makes it seem its plebby pool lava and it would seem like smth that would go unnoticed 75 timesJacob if youre reading this, clarifying for what npc tides hint was for would be more useful than a new hint :pepeselfie:Ye we just brought a plebby soul to jake and he gave the helmet, artifact and mandible (extremely real and extremel

herring as coords without solving anything, just using the numbers in the equation in the VC?i need to knowthere wasnt green on the ideaso i assumed nothuh strangejust went through august's ideasand there was no common theme in all of emidk what jacob meant with that we were closealthough i found a very interesting idea therehobo has one herrign that he cant put in museum cuz not enough slotsi donated 1m now i will wait (patience hint) for lava to risei did all thatonly thing i didnt do after 1m was wait for lava to risebut i dont have herring in inv cuz its in museumyes me 4 timesand pig like 50 times0well pig prob donated 1m with squidbut i didntnoonly boots, legs, chest and a fishno not helmettriedwe were so close hmall solutions were so simple once we found themwere overthinkinglike we had all these ideas what to do with plebby and believerbut it came down to just being 4202022 to believer when a plebby is nearbywe shouldnt overthinkthe solution is prob simpleboots werentchestplate wasntherring wasntlets brute force believer it wont be that expensive, most likely the only value needed is 1m and every1 can afford donating 1m once or twicesm1 did

focus on "Kuudra will bless you." and the 83 times something taking placeas the hints are connected to same thingbelieverafter u donate 1M+it could mean we have to take his literally or its related to the 1M+ donationwe dont know yet thoniceits used to get herringwe dont know if its used in the later step of believer thoppl have world downloadsthey'd notice any changes to the mapalso jacob didnt go

is our best idea rnto doabt the occurencefrom the fishing parties in the 2h is there a list of scc's caughtwhy are we pleb fishing is it even confirmed pleb is related to this stepby tmmrw imma be fishing 27 so i can also pleb fishso inv me to secret parties when i hit 27 :yep:im like 2h away from reaching ithmdonating damage?imma shoot it with alchemist staff, while wearing crown of greed and having gdrag 1b bank equipped then donate damage dealtalso whats a good plhlegblast fishing setup at fishing 27does shark work for pleb fishingYekoodriballsNext time ur fishing can u regularly check the lavaIf anything changeson the topic of hint npcs, why were there 2 hint npcs for archeologist and loremaster but none for arch and believerye but no npcs hinting at emso loremaster had 1 hinting at the blazing fortress and 1 hinting at netherwartarcheologist had 1 hinting at cata and 1 hinting at bookis there any hint npc for herring step?i wanna look into npcs if theres any believer hint npcs since its strange we havent found any yetjust got my relic like 1h agonoI tried all npcs with a herring after donating 1mexcept scarleton, but dwagon did scarleton with same conditionsI can donate 125mIs there a list of value to tryI can plebby fish now so i can test em myselfCan we make a fund or smth for the 125m numberThen sm1 trusted donates itI keep  forgering the 1b bank is gdragYou dont lose the divan's drill thoWe found a npcI can do 3934022I got my entire mining setup and 1b from selling some of my pet skin stashNo taxes involvedGot it all in a tradeImma go pleb fish nowsailor is most likely just 15 and 2Prob dono valueSo it makes sense nowSailor's "maybe you can fish up kuudra" is hinting at donating when plebbyTheres a big fish in these waters, maybe u can fish it up or smthIs his dialogue"A big fish in these waters"Did you see any other big fish in kuudra's endNot magma cube, its a lava krakenWhatever values we donate, donate them during plhlegblastImma pleb fish soon gimme some valuesWhy are you arguing over grammar can we fookin focus on donation valuesLemme tryI believe the sailor spawning and no1 noticing just some nons randomly donating believer to see dialogue then going into kooder soon afterI dont see how we donated 1m then beat kooderWhy would they make it 125mCan we organize a non-secret fishing party where every1 can donate because i can fish plegblasts now :YEP:1b on standbyI wanna pleb fish for the first time ever!!!!!Drakuu prob isnt the endWhat abt the mandible stepYes lets gatekeep low editions so those that participate in

and will we even get the helmet then?Believer is so strange and overcomplicatedSo do we focus on putting 15 and 2 into herring function or the other tracked statisticCoords?Maybe the other statistic gives the other coords?No, like -268 Y ZWhat if the numbers we would potentially get from the other tracked statistic plugged into Herring function are the Z coords?Wdym? A sailor hint?I think sailor's only purpose are numbersepoa the solution involved killing kuudra :pepeselfie:You were wrongYou find sailor after beating kuudra👍 👍 👍epoa you have problemsAlso mandible defo needs kooder to dieThe mandible stepI need values related to function with 15 and 2 are there really none ive been asking the whole day"Are you a believee in the return of Kuudra?" hints at the release date of kuudra although very vaguelyWe canMe tooAlso you can resell the drill if u only wanted it for kuudra relicSo what should we do nowThat we have 15 and 2Gm1/4 kuudra party need to test

just a fancy way to give us numbersBut i can try doing things with elephant and lion pets in f1/m1Not related cuz from new updateEverything released 1 week after crimson isleIs NOT relatedNo you need to click the bookshelf b4See carrot's msg in off topic on how to get 4k intelDuggy ur modJust delete itNot even an idea or hunt relatedI think its just a value with 268Whats the whole number2.7b 👍How do we donate a negative number:thonk:Pet levels?Wth is this stepOhhhhIts abt kuudra follower chestplateWe alr solved it, but it means kuudra pet's levelsYes he said chaos looking at pet levelsI got a mp brz during testing xdI think sailor dialogue is a fancy way to give us numbersI think we should focus on 268Herring function with 15 and 2YesWithoutI also did 268999 squidlessI donated everything without squidCan retest with squid thoThat was archeologist equationInto archeologist equationWe also put 15 into x and 2 into y this timeAnd got 268:pingsock_red:Were overthinking againFinding sailor is such a simple solutionI think we just do 268 simple thingyImma try the ridiculous helmetsBut whereWhere do i go underwaterThe point of the msg was looking into kooder pet levels for archAlso weird sailor dialogue is most likely just a way to give us numbersArch is solvedAlso hunt wouldnt use stuff from other steps.Avorius is a mage faction rep questAlthough there could be smth in the houseYe u can give to AvoriusFor 5 repEvery dayWolf area?Where thenNumbersWe shouldnt overthink sailor dialogue, just take numbers👍yeThats smth worth investigatingNot circus or train stuffI think its hidden dialogue u can unlockFlaming chestplate?Imma try to thibk abt secret bootsplebby?Sailor?he wont gibMogusDonate 268, 268999, 26899995WaitWhat if it was 2689995Look at the calculation!Me and dwagon got one in 30s then it deathedFrick its 267999 or 2679995 not 26899999  or 2689995 i forgorJust use chyme1 chyme is 500kAnd u get 1 per dayi only like 268what editionimma get my boots next tuesday i rlly

hunting  and repeatWhat except coords could be a negative numberWell i did just make a dh7 fs7 magma rodSo i can plebby fish that timeIm only fishing 27 and i wanna get dh 10 and fs 10 b4 even inferno so i ssve some moneyNow back to mandible :mandible: :YEP:I have a chance to get lower edition than u now :omegapog:I will get 5m by next weekPls dont start stalking me too i alr have a stalkerI no longer think sailor is just funi dialogue with numbersI think sailor is to be solvedWhat can we even do with just -268?I thin we gotta solve sailor dialogueDid jacob say they are related after they were found?Oh ye 2 and 20Not 2 and 22Ppl r focusing on circus too much i dont think thats relatedThe 15s under lava and mayb you could fish it up are more susIt isntConfirmed that it isntSm1 said a long time ago that we shouldnt think abt new items bciuz they maybe werent yet developed at the time of when the hunt was being madeThats probably the reason sulphur hasnt been involved and most likely wont beWhat abt in off topic?I think like herring is a riddle that kuudra gave to us, sailor is just a form kuudra took to help usBecause in t1 kuudra doesnt dieWe just attack its tentacles15s under lava, big fish in water mayb u can fish upWe have enough to solve without hintWe just got sailorCrimson Isle, to get herringi hate how sailor splits us between "its just 15 and 2" and "we have to solve his dialogue"i need more resultswhy is believer such a weird stepso far its such a weird stepdid any1 try 267999 or 268999 while plebbyfunction with 15 and 2david should i put on THE skin for when i fish plebwhat was it 26799995 or 26799999ok so david did donate the right number!now i gotta do 26799995 or 26799999 which one was itwhich one was iti wanna know b4 i do iti dont rlly need 3 imma give to david or sm1 else i only plan on fishing up one for an noombardavid that looks oddly like ur pfpok mandiblei am once again asking if it was 26899995 or 26899999 or 26799999 or 26799995oh sm1 said smth abt shenme dumbwe alr clicked him with seal thowait lemme buy smth from da then speek to funi sailorits extremely useful for minion slime afking268 :catnod:We shouldnt look into lore too much imoAll solutions were straight forward and we only needed npc dialogueWe needed to beat kuudra in the current stepWeird Sailor appears after beating kuudraBut to see him u have to be blessed (donating 1m )The effect of the blessing lasts 10 minsSlightly deeper lava?Like a block deeper?No this is importantAll lava blocks there f 1 block deepIf this is rlly 2 block this means thats where we can diveFor sailorWe tried things on f1 and m1U mean bonzo heads?Ur prob gonna try a ton of things reshirex alr tested so read from 18th of september forwardWhat was tested in #hunt-testedSo u dont

mewat was thatwhen u put 2 and 22 into archeologist equationwas the coords the only anwseronly anwser?do we get multiple for herringits in the order 15 and 2pogo change ur nameso 268 is the only anwser for functioni meant with 15 and 2 :2Dumb_Bonk:if u get 268then why is every1 not focusing on itherring function with 15 and 2we should still testcan we get our mana down to 268can we get mana down to 268 no matter our game stage268 in exp bar?268 bits?u get cookie on b zwdymdid we try 267999 when pleband ik there was some 27m number that i forgor aboutwhat was the 27m number sm1 said to testfishing up kuudra?cuz sailor said thatwhere do we fish for kuudra thodo u lose coins when dying in kuudra lavasmth weird is that having a herring of your own wasnt required for sailorso finding sailor might not be required for next stepmaybe its just his dialogue and/or numbersye ik but u can find him without having one of your owni think sailor is just telling us to do smth from his dialoguelike scholarwithout further interactions with himpollany1 have any ideas?sailor says waters and not squid or kuudra but fishwhat if he isnt reffering to kuudra's end and kuudrapersonally i think by fishing up "Kuudra" he means the plebbyYou're now going 2 da circus!wchis took up the entire screenim on computer and it was the whole screen :floppaXD:did what???wdymCan you use grizzly bait as actual bait tho?Iirc no:thonk:NoOld ember is discontinuedSo its defo not usedAlso we did that alr:pig:weslayLets combat /hunt sailorWith smth that adds Mindcraft to ur nameK now i say mandible stuffWhat is the 26m value sm1 mentioned was there any reasoning behind it?Lost Adventurer isnt related to hunt btwThen y u talking abt him in #hunt-discussionIt might make new ppl think hes relatedSrry didnt mean to come off as rudeU still need the kuudra runs?ok imma log onhow many runs?okim backi can also help with itwhat even was the test?now try smth with f1/m1he gives 2 numbers, 15 and 2we believe we have to put 15 and 2 into the herring functionwe believe its related to 268although sailor's dialogue could also be of some usemainly the train and circus partwe tried things in dwarven railway and f1 and m1like a lotyou can see how many things reshirex tried in hunt testedrelating to railway and f1/m1methats an ad i made to recruit new ppli put in that u cant necromancy on squid and jake was only a metaphor rnfix'dwhat is the bounty  rni have to update the postmafin mutedprob mafin cuz he automutedmore circles plsnot enough circlesmore arrows pls and where is an image of the mandiblewat is the exact result of 15 and 2 in herring functionwoti meant the -267.99999 thingim a better budget hunter (veteran)you cannot use necromancy on a plhlegblastI think the big fish is plebbyAnd it meand we have to donate a 268 related value when plebgnI think its as simple as a 268 related value at a plhlegblastDont forget how simple all solutions have beenWe had so many complicated ideas for believer 1st step, but it was just 4202022 when a plebby was nearbySo i think its as simple as a 268 value at plebWhat abt the 27m numberNo david tried that iircThere was a 27m iircWere overlooking sailor so much rnLets just look for a simple solutionI still believe sailor is only 15 and 2 but fishing up the big fish and 15s under lava is interestingIf its a red herringThen why did jacob want us to solve itIf herring isnt relatedThen we hsve nothing for sailorIt alrdy repeated4202022 then 1mWhat zone is it in?We alr have the bootsNoSailor was unlocked for every1 with the 1st herringWhatever the big fish to fish up is i dont think its in kuudra's endYou only have like 30s and u cant fish up a rare thing likr a plebby in the 50s kuudra's end is opemMaybe u insta get it if u fish it up with the condition?Im in bed (i woke up like 30 mins ago)Imma try to log onIm getting my 4th relicok im onwho is in lobbycan u party mewhere do i clicki always forgetmei need my relic ;-;gib lobby me needs relicno1 joiningyeits been 7dnopIVE PARTIED OVER 10 PPL FROM THAT LOBBYno1 acceptedim inwhere do i clickstill on cd for no reasonsmhFlochForsteryeany1 wanna do the 268 kooder run268show thoi meant the 268s onemaybe spirit mask could workbut wither cloak and mithril coat didntis a 267s run possibleohg has reqs of hunting and seasonedwe alr know abt the 4k mana bookshelf its used for Kuudra Archeologist equation and its solvedwhen i was doin runs it seemed like 15 minsthen he disappearedmaybe theres a different factor for blessing lengtha common theme in believer is fishingi think we have to step away from believer for now and fish up the big fishi dont think the big fish is kuudra thowait solution was always obvious and straight forwardim overthinkingbig fish is prob just kooderwe just have to do smth with fishing kuudra or ellemaybe its referring to ellehow long does elle have fishing rod in lavai think its ellecan sm1 help me do elle tests (i'll hypm)does elle ever have fishing rod in lava for exactly 15swe should think of a simple solution without overthinking and relating to only npc dialoguejust buy fire veil on ah and salvage it and there u go ez fiberno rllythats how i got itidk if still works thodoes elle use any baitdid any1 observe thatneed help with kuudra fight?i need to do some runs for observation (im hypm)literally no1 in guild or lobby joined my kuudra partyhunt is non linearand doesnt reuse steps2 and 22 r alr used in archeologist who is solvedtheres a small pool by odexar's housealthough odexar and his dialogue is most likely not used since he is faction locked and some of his dialogue is faction lockedif theres a barb counterpartthen it makes senseU need 4.1k manaThats 4k intelDid u try clicking other bookshelfs around itHuh strangeLast cataclysmic i was about to borrow drill to sm1 but they also coukdnt get the book with 4k manaJust dm the imgwait maybe giant fishing rod cuz big fish?frick i forgot giant fishing rod was after crimsonI think its smth with elle (she fishes up kooder)bean stuffy rn!Carrot made this oneme tooI think its simple but theres some obscure conditionI think its in the timeframe of elle fishing up kuudraMaybe sailor hinted at thatWhat can we do in the time elle is fishing up kuudraAnd for how long does she do itYes pleaseWe found sailor like 1 week agoWe have a ton to do with his dialogueWe need hints if we get stuck on sailor for a monthDrakuu is prob mandible or artiOk dont jacobruby moment me but this kinda looks like theres more to sailor than 15 and 2stuffy whatUr overthinkingAll solutions were straight forward and only related to npc dialogueAny other weird sailor anagrams?gnProb not relatedIts just his boatBut i have my theories about it being related to the only train related thing in sbDwarven RailwayMinecarts also burn in lavaIf minecart is related, it has to be somehow related to the dwarven railway which is the most similar thing to a trainye i think we have to do smth while elle is fishingstats pipe is defo just a joke and not a part of the hintWe solved the occurences thoIt was sailorSea emp hint solvedIt was for herringI also dreamt abt believer but sailor wasnt there. Believer was behind a jasper vein and u had to bring 268 fine jaspers to him for helmerltCan u find it in magma fieldsThe da4. It just means kuudra and lavaWe arentI think we have to do smth while elle is fishing it upHot Bait ig?If there was bait tho, i doubt it would be actual baitMaybe somehow use the herring as a bait(I actually once forgor its from shen update and thought we have to fish up kooder with it)How could we use the herring as a baitI mean kuudra gave it to us soreplace 🦆 with :PogoDuck:Anyways back to :mandible:I still refuse to believe herring only exists so only the 1st one triggered sailorIt has to have a useNoYou cant use necromancy on a plhlegblastI opened it once to see if it was updated for arch and sailor 💀I think we have a limited amount of time to do smth while elle is fishing it upEnough discord for todaygnYe the actual theory should be mentionedBut not the shitpost aspect of itvery funiDid we try having a water rod in kuudra's end for 268 ticks? (not joking)Yo new member les goFaction lockedHe alr has a use thoAll other hunt related npcs have no other useThats sounds so stupid that it might just workNoIt isnt.what did u findtell usUnobtainable thoIt was craftable for the 1st few weeks of sb releaseEver since then, its uncraftableAnd therefore unobtainable:nolead:pogo has one iircUnobtainable item thoUnobtainable for over 3yIm not joking, but did any1 try crafting a salmon hat with herringsWhat u doin with the 268 cubesoh using sulphur as baitThats smartPig also try 2 cube, 6 ench, 8 normalOdexar has a suspicious lava pool next to himDid any1 try fishing thereTry now :yep:Odexar has same dialogue for both faction so i think hes worth looking intoK odexar added to info listAny other stuff to mention abt odexar?euri's status!Ok back to mandibleWhat do i add to odexarVelyna?The fortune tellerKheharad is defo crimson v2 or kuudra revampGives me gwendolyn vibesCould also sell the mandible after u originally get it idk who knowsnoback to odexarodexar giving 80 coins is susBig fishOverdoneSoul?i think sm1 did thatAnd also thunder soulWhen u finish mage quest he gives u 80 coinshe saysTake those 80 coins and dont spend them at onceBig fish should be our main focus thoIm making sulphur evo v2, making herring the big fish (not a joke)We also shouldnt overthinkAll solutions were straight forward and only related to npc dialogueWait do overthinkcuz kooder return --> 4202022 was a large stretch*7dbased reshirexYou found a Kuudra Relic!You claimed Kuudra Relic!oh this is my 4th relic, 438 btwits funi how i got same leg edition as my discord tag439and artifactmeif boarthdayhow do i get 2.5b museum so i can buy itthat was extremely scuffed but we got ityeIn t1 it should work since we only attacked its tentacles but idk if we can fish it up after killing itI think we must show sailor the kuudra fightwhat happened was sailor was unlocked at the 1st ever herringidk but it is like thatwe should focus on sailorlook at where only focusing at herring got utusnot solving anything abt believer for over a month and a halfyesalso its not an actual baiti think the next lead (i dont think next step is the helmet) is guaranteed from fishing up in kooder's place under some obscure conditionfish with blessed bait during fight and some unknown condition is my best betfloch follower set 1st (ur literally my stalker 🙄)Me like this ideathe red sky to blue sky could be parallels to water and lavaSo sailor saying these "waters" mightve not been just "HaHa lOoK Hes SO StrAnge"Oh no so sad! :supershocked:AnywaysI think circus and train are meant to be hints for equipment or armor maybe even rodAnd we have to use those with blessed bait in kooder fightMe with my usual stupid stretches, a tier of a dojo belt cuz "training"But iirc u cant buy em at rusty so any tier should workIn like 2h and 30 mins can sm1 join a kooder w me i need to test smthI have idea that i will test in 2hWeird Sailor: let me introduce myself1st ever herring was prob unlock for sailorAnd thats it for herringElaborate furtherWhy exactly *that* numberabandon mandible abandon mandiblemodsmake a new channel for thisthis one is for mandiblethe other one for spookyguys make new spook hunt channelhi mods make a new channel for spooky hunt :pepeselfie:anything found except talis?rogue flesh defo rogue swordwith so many new ppl were prob solving mandible very soonneed sm1 to join kooder w me we need to beat him (im hypm)kooder fishing with bozo mask and dojo belt1 more person :prayge:ok aviex just leftwe need another person:pepeselfie:what if combinations is 15 + 2most sane mandiballer:breharguing is cringe, lets go back to huntingcan i trust reshirex with drill(Hes givign racing helmet and 200m as collat)bumpflock moment :2Dumb_Bonk:now i see i can trust ppl hereno the trusted pplthe ones who put time into hoonting and would have no reason to scamjade vein stealer :pepeselfie:carrot i have decided you can have the drill when its the timeit is not poggers :2Not_Cool:sameyay veteran contentcoolofficial or fandom wiki?No it was the relic  pingIm mostly on kooder fishingThats our best idea rnIts prob fishing up kooder eith obscure conditionsI still believe herring's only use is that the 1st one ever unlocked sailor and thats itVery cool and goog ppl will read now and new ppl will be engaged for mandiball hunttalon got the helmet 2 weeks ago (very real and even more incredible)Wait thats the real skin of it?How did u get itYe ive been saying bounty needs an upgradeIf we wanna keep the new ppl invested we need a 100m+ bounty*2hWhat if we have to combine all things in sailor dialogueInto 1 lava fishingcircus: bozo mask, cath train: dojo belt (you train at dojo), 15 and 2: blessed bait,Are there any big fish itemsAre there any train related items(Dont say minecart i beg)Imma donate tmmrw this will get new ppl to help us :YEP:Not googOk this even further makes me think artifact is the 2 kuudra sulphur protestersIts defo themSulphur IS relatedArtifact texture is based on itSo it existed when hunt was being madeAviar and Gnyl artifact defo fr frHaha so funny im laughingAlso admin confirmed it if ur actually seriousMandible texture defo changing after we find itTell us stillArtifact is literally kooder tentacles over sulphur cubeMakes me thi k gnyl and aviar are for the artifactWe prob need full set and artifact for mandibleFull set for artifact is unlikelyI think theres a link between kuudra protesters and barb protestersYeEven 4 cubes, 20 ench, 2022 normalWe were doing it cuz we were so desperate that we went to try protesters :YEP:Anyways was chaos' 125m number tried?I literally asked if it was tried since it was basically a combination :2Dumb_Bonk:what was the exact numberikr!why that numberhmmmanyways back to :mandible:I think its:wait we did?can u link the msgtalon got it loli hope this hint wont just be smth like just "combinations"I hope the hint gives as a small idea of what we should do cuz sailor dialogue could mean a lot of thingsIt'd be protesters, i think they are for artifactCant wait for hint boar hint268 is very yes:ChaosButterfly: is an emoji for some reasonDENGi think deng still might be relatedTriedTried iircand smarty pants also triedHmThat could mean smthTheres a condition you have to meet, but when its met the piece is guaranteedIts no longer bugged (i had to pay 30m for confirmation)admin confirmed it isnt rng relatedisnt that enough proofYou just pinged landon and mrkeith_W H Y_WHATNOWHAT THE FUCKwhatwhatthis is so strangewhy did they add new stuffisnt everything supposed to be alr made since 1 week b4 huntwhat triggered thisSo there was some other trigger for that dialoguebut now its changed?I was doing the right thing it seemsbozo mask with resp 1 while fishing for kooderthat was the combinationits all coming togethetIk ikBut its a parti always used a dojo beltas it was obtsined from "train"ingWe dont have the item that triggers dialogue after "mayb u could fish it up?"We need to get the dialogueImma fish up plebby with resp 1 bozo maskwait noan item is missingspeak to it with herring in hand rnThe secret part is just the 15s lava partwe only need fish it updid u try holding herring in handthis isnt donationsthis can be brutrforcedsailor bruteforcing parties rnI see all of it clearly nowsailor dialogue tells us new reqs to do smth (presumably fish up pleb)We have 2/3 reqstry all fishing rods try all fishing rodswith specific reforgesThe "..."'s could indicate a line to be solvedSo its the secret part and big fish partwe have 2 things to solvebruteforce sailor with items relating to the words: line 1: SECRET; line 2: FISH, FISHING,nahi think we just have to unlock all secret dialogueand then use all itemswhile doing smth(Prob pleb fishing)isnt it just resp 1or does it have to be submergedtry all rods with all reforgeswe have to bruteforce thiswait yea"these waters" could mean its a water rodWhat fishing reforge would make most sense for fishing up kuudraLets get the helmetimagine we get helmet and its like edition 15whyIts most likely 1. A water rod 2. With a specific reforgeAlso the secret partthats smth we have to doAny ideas on the secret part?hmmmnot supposed to be obtained its a quest itemSomehow it can be put on ah thoWhere do i join testing

we know what the obfuscated stuff in napkin isThe 2nd obfuscated thing is only 2 letterswhat could be 2 lettersalso is its description just weird or is it related to math stuffso it could be related to herring if its mathMaybe herring got a purpose once we got napkinits time to do the thing again thenputting all our herrings into museumSo did we find any relation of napkin to herringToday im organising kuudra runs (im hypm) where u can borrow my tux (need 75m collat) cuz im selling the tux tmmrwprobany ideas on the 1st word (i refuse to believe it actually is imposter unless it was in hunt announcements or a mod confirmed it)letters changing makes it hard to look at is it 7 letters or 8 lettersdoes that reveal the obfuscateted textwhy are the eyes unmarkedthey look like amogiDoes it have anything in its nbtthe napkinWhat does elbuod mean i never seen that word b4 or is it just double backwardsI dont understand any math butCould it mean -2ye that tooI might be overthinking but is the napkin sailor's?After we solved sailor it makes me think more of the Kuudra Herring Guidr theorythat kooder is giving us herring as a riddle and that herring unlocked sailor so we could solve him and get napkin to complete herringAnd sailor is just a human projection of the almighty kooderThe whole believer step is orchestrated by kooder to see if were a true follower of kooder(my theory not confirmed)The randomness and length of it 💀I wanna dry the napkin maybe it mskes the obfuscated text visibleDid we try hyper foornaceI borrow for 75m collatand do kooder runs as hypmAlthough premade, the believer step looks like its making fun of usI got blessing do its 2x drops thing on mine and it deleted 2nd oneJacob is just the hint mandueces made this a long time agoi think we have to dry the napkin b4 we get to see obfuscated textAlso there has to be some reason the game literally insta wipes ur extra napkinswhy would you only be allowed to have oneThat would be basedCan i add to believer list that weird sailor is fully solvedOr could there be more to himdry the napkin dry the napkin dry the napkinwhat did we try with drying iti need a list of things triedMy idea was to drop it in crimson isle cuz crimson isle hot so it dries it but u can get only one so u only have one chance and even dueces wouldnt do that to usHow longi wanted like 1s b4 it would despawn@davidamiago is literally gabagoolDavid try itYesI can loan but with 75m collatalso it would be just in lfg threafbut no pingwhy exactly ice bait and how is a napkin a big fishWait (official) wiki said u need to have obtained herring at least once to get napkinnever mentioned here thois that true?@Goat Girl Gwen can u be a test monkeyu dont own a herring i assumeohOk lets do itAnyways mandibleLets do the testneed cannoners tho@mafinam mind if i kidnap(kin) you for a kooder?finally talon admits to having the helmet (very real):follower:did u find smth?i rlly hope u dont have to use

thoi think napkin math stuff will do herring equation or something2 thing on napkintell usthe best edition i couldve gotten was like 30i got it like 8 mins after chaos posted the thingi waited up to 2 am and defo worth itthe item literally makes fun of us tooherring desc saying "was it worth all this" and napkin says hang in theredueces literally designed this to bully us along the way as were finding it XDdoesnt reuse stepsyes, but they get insta wipedsource: meye very sadi wanted a wall of kittiesbut sb mean😦to get napkinits required for napkini was normally looking around and saw ppl like arch and drakuu and believer thinking of some grand conspiracy shit (like i thought for ch with xalx and chunk)then i saw dragoon vidand the hunt was real15 wasresp 12 was prob just a numeronymthe hunt was prob made waaaaay b4 that and the amogi are just a coincidence and i bet 5b they are unrelated268p mecan we stop talking abt the amogi now its becoming annoyinglets actually solve napkinhunt discussion 268 bestcan we stop mentioning it its 100% not relatedwhy would pixel amogi be related to huntcan we focus on changing the state of the napkin so we could see the obfuscated text instead of amogi plseaster egg thats it lolits literally pixel amogi and i havent heard of any theories abt itdrying it or smth like thatwe have to unblur the obfuscated textbut with whatcopy pasting it, sadly item desc dont work like thatye thats why i think we have to change the state of it do a different item called "dry napkin" or smth like thatwait thats actually a really good ideawhens next jerry eventnon linearwouldnt use relicsSirih is barb faction locked and a barb faction rep quest so most likely not relatedAll npcs used in thr hunt so far had no use other than the huntOkwhere are the bigger ones is there an img with all of em showndarq said the nbt of napkin shows the obfuscated text as -- and -------- so we'd need a new item which would show nbt which means we prob need to change the state of the napkin to make the blurry scribbles visiblebut we tried drying it in a ton of different ways and it didnt workisnt that supposed to be the matriarch's uvulaand not actual pigsye i think its turning into its original statemaybe not dryingwhat about obtaining it b4 sailor shows upwait i have ideap mecan i use one of you as a kuudra fragbot for 1s i need to test smthcan i use sm1 as a kuudra fragbot rq i need to test smthis there any way to fish at napkin place in kuudra fight or when elle is spawning itdoes kuudra laser come when fight starts (elle starts fishing it up) or when tentacles spawnu get instakilled if u get too far from kuudra arenagetting napkin before sailor shows up so it isnt wet yethow did we know sailor dropped itthere is nothing after napkin tried fishing like 30 times afterye we still dont know about big fish and why ice bait out of all baitsif we didnt have new dialogue it'd take us like at least 2 more weeks lolwe need to get a napkin b4 it got wetcould we get it off sailor before he dropped it into the lavawe need sailor to give it to uswas herring wikiable b4 it was foundits not wikiable cuz no1 found it yetif it even exists that isthen our best bet is filling the obfuscated text with words from a new item or hidden npc dialogue or smthwhat would 1st bethis reminds me to update believer list 💀saywe need ideastell usstill tell usisnt the game Among Us copyrighted why would they make it Among Us out of all thingsit would make sense if the word among us was used in a different context in the sentenceand the amogi on the image were hinting at what the word washow would it make sense thenthe sentence "among us of yourself" doesnt make much senseits -------- and --what if it was initials of smththe "of yourself" part is the 2 letter oneit'd make the most sense if it was a number"There are at least 29 hidden Among Us characters hidden in this image." why is this on the official wiki 💀why 15 out of all numbersthe 15 in sailor dialogue was for resp 1i dont think it would be used againresp 1not 3im dumbpigi wiki says albuod not elbuod :pepeselfie:it might make ppl think its not backwards doubleso edit just in case when u have the timety for updating #read-me-first weslay 👍wdym jungleye weslay should edit the img and add napkinin the img with items in #read-me-first napkin isnt therei think there wont be any items after napkin and that we tie in napkin with herring and solve thiswhat if talisman and ring exist and the step upgrades it kinda like the great spook artifactwhat if the artifact step has 3 steps, 1st gives it, 2nd makes it ring, 3rd makes it artifact**POLL:**#deleted-channelif theres a thing that finds amogi in images there has to be some thing that finds letters in imagesdid we try finding letters in cat img (not the "hang in there", hidden letters)prob half or -2prob half or -2elbuodstoopid discord lag sending my mssgs twice >:(Whats the full sentence by filling in with "among us" and "29"also im kinda dumb so pls tell me if among us theory is seriousglass theory was a goog theoryCouple days ago i was explaining to my friends in skull about how i spend over 4h daily on hunting a lava squid jaw in a kids block gamei was more active b4 but skull kileld meI look it as more of it pointing fun of us like herring descFishing near the Weird Sailor

1. Mine got affected by blessing ench and the other one was insta wipeddid any1 try giving a napkin to their coop with a napkin+ we most likely alrrady fully solved sailorsince we got an item from fishing next to himthose arent missing lines most likelythey were prob just indicators of the missing lines of bonzo, resp, tux and ice baitseperating the 5 other parts of his dialogueto show us what itemsYou need 2 ppl of the mage faction wearing ember armor with a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped in Scarleton Plaza, 2 ppl of the barbarian faction wearing ember armor with a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped in Dragontail Townsquare and 2 ppl wearing ember armor with a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped in Stronghold. If those conditions are met, you can claim without having ember armor or lvl 81+ kuudra pet yourself.also rekindled ember armor also works but most ppl use normal ember armorTheyve been out for monthsunobtainable thothey didnt get added wirh new updatethats one of the 3 dialoguesthat comes when an npc cant be abiphonedye but the new abiphone stuff cant be relatedGreat 👍Hunt is self sufficientwouldnt use things outside mccontent released after 1 week after crimson isle was releases isnt relatedtake his soulits gone for me everytime i go on my island again, then u have to put out of the frame and put in againye bothbut the 1st one b4 napkin was foundTried dropping all 3 variants on each of his tentacles and his head in t2wasnt it changed so u cant recomb stuff like sulphur anymorealso what would recombing do?the 2 obfuscated sentences r prob the same for everyone imodragoon wouldnt be related to the hunt as the hunt is self sufficient  meaning it doesnt require outside sources and is to be solved exclusively in Hypixel Skyblockalso the hunt was made way before dragoon made his first video on itwhy would simon's island be relatedit isnt related to any people, not even the hunt's creatorAlso the time travel thing was already used in the step for kuudra loremasterand hunt is non linear, meaning steps of different npcs arent relatedPomtair is faction locked and alr has a usealr doin thatDavid's rods idea from #hunt-ideas and getting napkin from sailor before he dropped itbut first i wanna try over 100 variations of "even more wet" and "dry" napkinson /wikiwait so ur saying that under the conditions the text would change from -- and -------- to the numbers we needyesbut however i believe herring was only used to unlock itK i'll trywhat if we need to find the obfuscated bits outside napkinwhat if they are in already existing and accessible npc dialoguehints like the ones in sailorimo its sailor'swait thats smartusing herring to fill in napkibbut what 2 letter word from herring would u useits gonna be 3 months of herring soonthats how long believer takesi think artifact is protesters and mandible drakuuok thats a bit of a stretch pigWhat even happened to big fishthat part was for ice bait and we caught a napkinThe 2 letter one is prob harder than 8 letter onelike what could it becould it be an abbreviation?It has to be an abbreviation or number if it was "HP" or "XP" it would be a different value for each playerAlso different for each playerIt prob leads to a donation value and it would be weird for everyone to donate a different valueany ideas for that npc?suus is a faction locked rep quest and scholar was used in kuudra follower legs stepAre there any empty item frames in sbwait gogglessailor has gogglesWe have to see better so it unblurslike weslay said maybe its like with relic u can obtain one after an amount of time has passed of u getting the 1st oneOh i havent did the thingy of bringing it to every npc yet 💀ok imma do that when i get homeThats suspicious vial reforge stone mafinNothing elsepig as stupid as this sounds try reforging napkin with itMy new theory is smth to make u see the obfuscated bitscuz sailor wears goggles he might see the texthow do u do thatin sbthoWhat goggles/glasses are in sb except the cata oneswhy would it be ci mapits literally a funny cat imageisnt the img from stock images on googlesWear the funi armorfish at sailor with thisdo the napkin thing with thisBozo and tuxHave 29 vials in inv while fishing at sailorwait boots?u didnt use full?ohis it still goingsend ss and ask a hunter or mod to relic pingEnhanced vision to see blurred out text igoh cuz tux?kuudra loremaster is already solvedalso yes there is a recreation of that skinyeawe got napkin alrnowhat waiter thowhat npc do u meanthose are bartendersbut still worth showing em the napkinAll things added after 1 week after crimson isle release are not relatednah its from sunshade patch cuz that fixed 4k mana book giving the numbers 2 and 20 instead of 2 and 22Wait do we have the new lines for loremaster yetcuz meek posted that the prvs ones no workwho here didnt do loremaster chat trigger, react to this msgOld lines r outdated we have to find the new onesAnd as 2 lines were from hot tier last time, these couls be in any tier for 1 - 4 (infernal not out yet so imma rule that out)pig do yall have the whole new kuudra dialogue yet?cuz on wiki elle's lines are still from the old oneOk yall who reacted ill make a party where u guys try dialogue from new kuudras (we'll do dialogue from 1 tier then move on to the next to keep it organised)Meanwhile were waiting lets find the new loremaster chat triggers!old ones dont work meek tested itherepig said for ppl with an alt but ig meek did it cuz they never did it b4they didnt show testing thatOld lines still worked (tested by az8)it didnt change az alr tested itOld lines still worklooks like meek just forgot they alr told loremaster the chat triggerlolno it was added in the new updatenot the day napkin was found1.69%ss?yesits gone:hollow:it expired 2 mins after he posted ss, dw tho all other times it gets relic pingedu cant use necromancy on a plhlegblastno not yethe spawns in a cornerand u cant see him from far awayfirst ever herring unlocked sailorus solving arch did nothing about believerhe used to behe, average and nomface were demoted some time ago for not moderating enough if i remember correctlynot yetAs herring says, patience is the key to victorythe numbers from hints were solved, it was occurences of sailor appearing but us not noticing itwe already found and solved sailordont try to do that, it might autocorrect to the actual pingits been overtriedu cant craft it, and even if u could it prob couldnt be crafted until final stepwere on helmet rnSend it to me for most things i test i get told its alr been testedOk just tell me if its been tested b4 i test smth k?pretty likely, and our best bet rnthe eyes look like amoguses tooif the first obfuscated part is 29 i dont think the second obfuscated part would be among us related29 being the first obfuscated bit makes sense, but among us/imposter/crewmate being the 2nd rlly doesntye but we also gotta look for other things in the imgi think all we need is already in the image itself:weird:You cant use necromancy on a plhlegblastalso the bringing a sea emperor to jake is a metaphor:pepeselfie: i existKuudra 5: the kuudra mandiblewe stan funny zwhat would the 8 letter one be im losing my mind over thisguys hear me outwhat if its believerit kinda makes sensei interpretate it as believer donationsnot the believer100k, 1m, 4202022have special dialoguesWait in this caseit would be the total donationok so 29 and 5302022 what would be the result of the thingin this case im taking the 2 letter one as 29How do i calculate it with "29" and "donation (5302022)"the thing on napkinSo 3 possible outcomes cuz of elbuodCalculate some rqnopnothing happened after napkin foundyes it hasbut that would most likely never be the anwsericy alr didneverid rather waste that on believertesting all numbers has 3 variations cuz of elbuod so its gonna cost a tontbh we dont rlly need hint all we need is prob in the napkinno i meant that the 2 obfuscates things are prob in the imgim convinced the 2 letter one is 29its amongi29 of yourself igEither related to ur hp, mp or xpin that casewhat about total donationall donation that give special dialogue5302022is total donationpig do relic pingman"29" and "5302022 (total donation)"the amongithe 8 letter one would be 5302022and 2 letter one 29TriedsameCactus Helmetsirihyou give him sulphur and you get barbarian reputationhe is a faction locked reputation questso most likely not relatedany ideas on 8 letter wordlike for the 2 letter one its prob easier to narrow it downit could be hp, mp, xp, 29, another number...for 8 letter one idk tho except believer or donation or herringsnah we dontthis step looks way easier than sailortheres been a large decrease of activity in hunt channels idk whyand we even have a 325m bountyprobably because we dont need onejacob said he was quiet in the majority of august because we were so close to finding sailorso i suppose thats the case for napkin ig ¯\_(ツ)_/¯yewe searched itnothingwe solved Kuudra Loremaster alreadyhe gave us Kuudra Follower Bootsalr triedi want to talk abt mandible, any ideas for the obfuscated bits?if its server wide and not player related then theres not many optionsits a 2 letter word after allI dont think it would be player related for bothwhat 8 letter word would be player relatedi think of it as smth like first one is a number, xp, hp, mp... and 2nd one donation, believer, herringsYe thats what i was thinking of, 1 player related, 1 server widethe total donationwould total donation be all of the values that give believer a different line1k doesnt give special dialogue iircUnder 100k, over 100k, 1m, 4202022idk10k?or a combination of donating thoseone after anotherwe donate one after anotherIts the total donationmaybe doing that gives new dialoguebut ye ur rightcould total herrings make sensewhat if it was how many herrings the player hasplayer specificI think the 2 letter one is 29it ties in the amoguses which are weird to includei dont think theyd add them unless they served a purposeok back to mandible pleasekinda makes sense for it to be 29but im stuck on the 8 letter onewhereIt ties in the 29 thingies on napkin, its a number and is 2 lettershp makes most sense in that casecuz its the same hp for everyone in elegant tuxye but its the same for everyonejust put in 250we checked the nbt of the itemnoits a stock image of a catthe cheeseburger thing from great spook isnt related to the mandible hunti tried those alrwhich onei did with lasea and odexar idk if i did with odger thou meant odger thenye sm1 should bring kuudra teeth to him i havent did that yetWe tried clicking all kuudra npcs with kuudra teethno resultsalso clicking a plhlegblast with ityealfg thread chestplate ping#deleted-channeland do @ chestplate ping when you want a party to get the chestplateNot necessarily, something wouldnt be a req just because its expensivedivan drill was a req as it has the highest breaking power in the game and the cataclysmic erruption "weakens" the rock containing the kuudra relicCoul be just for the funnies, could be relatedone of the theories is that the 2nd obfuscates bit is "29" which is the amount of the amongisince its kinda weird to just include them and them not having a purposeJust the talis is worth it imonetherrack about 20h with the max setupListed on the cool website made by carror and duggy(Its in pins)idk why #hunt-discussion has been dying lately we have a huge lead in the form of napkin and a 325m bountywdym codenbt?herring has an function in its nbtnot_a_hint: "f(x,y)=x^3+xy^2+y^2, u=(-125)i+(230)j"napkin however has nothing special in its nbtprobably but it could also be a red herringwe should focus on the napkin rnWait he isnt? :supershocked:prob to indicate its a hunt like golden ball wasso ppl wouldnt just brush it off as smth coming in kuuder revamptried both variations (tbf it was b4 we knew armor existed)Wait stacks 💀I forgor u were being sarcasticConfirmed not a kuudra dropgoog forgKheharad?yei dont think wearing npc skins would be related or that it would be locked behind a hard to obtain bingo itembut if u rlly insist on trying, voball and superduggy117 have ditto skull so they can tryditto skull existed before crimson islesyou are confusing it with ditto blobcrimson isles released april 20th while ditto skull released on november 29thno content released after crimson isle is relatedthese are just lines u get when u cant add an npc to your contacts which was added a few weeks agowhat map is thatprob a visual bug thenits backwards doublenowere still doing kuudra believerim gonna go back to vision testing (using items related to enhancing ur vision so u could theoretically see the blurry parts)any1 have any ideas for what items to test? list of things i tested relating to it is in #hunt-ideas idk why it wont let me link the threadye i tried night vision pot and sm1 alr tried lensalso i tried funi ender monocleye furniturewait no its called illusion glassalso its an exclusive halloween cosmeticso prob unrelatedwdym corrupting?averag said its alr been testedx y z's?ye testing what about themwe still havent fully solved itwere currently solving Kuudra Believer's stepof which were very close to fully solving it3/6we need the helmet, artifact and mandiblewere rlly close to helmet thoThere isnt only one setevery player can get a setif they meet the requirememts for itfor leggings you need to click the block at -373 82 -880 with a divan's drill during a cataclysmic erruptionfor boots you need to say 1 of the 3 chat triggers to kuudra loremaster then grind 5m magma cream and 5m netherrack collection and have 16 stacks of enchanted netherrack and 16 stacks of enchanted magma cream in your inventory while talking to him in the blazing fortress which you can only access from the deep caverns. Also he only appesrs in the blazing fortress on tuesdays.for chestplate you need 2 people of the mage faction in ember armor and a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped in scarleton plaza, 2 people of the barbarian faction in ember armor and a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped in dragontail townsquare and 2 people in ember armor of any faction and a lvl 81+ kuudra pet equipped at the strongholdWhen all those conditions are met, the claimer can talk to arch and recieve the chestplateIt has a function in its nbtIsnt redirecting to it beanablenot_a_hint: "f(x,y)=x^3+xy^2+y^2, u=(-125)i+(230)j"this is whats inside herring the fish's nbtNow lemme explain the believer step so farWe cant solve it cuz the x and y r missingalso a calculator we use for it is in pinsOk so kuudra believer so far:the Wet Napkin also appears to have some math thing, but it has 2 obfuscated bits that we can only speculate aboutout of bounds for the crimson islehowever we currently believe that Herring The Fish is a red herring as it already has a use, that being you cant catch the wet napkin without having obtained it onceYou cant go to those coords on any islandif it were possible wed know months ago when the herring was foundno we found nothing there and a large portion of it is inacessibleThat was only the Kuudra Loremaster steprelated to time travelyealed to -373 82 -880That step is fully solvedEnchanted clock is unobtainablealso only the loremaster step which is fully solved was time travel relatedThis sounds dumb, but there should be some 3 or 4 question quiz b4 u can talk in #hunt-discussion and #hunt-ideas that u read #read-me-firstidk how it would be implemented thoi opened it once a month agoand weslay said there was only 1 view 💀in that timehow do u make like 4 questions that if u dont anwser correctly most of them you cant talk in hunt channelsBut its literally unobtainablewhats even hinting at it?time travel was loremaster and loremaster is solvedGreen is tested, yellow is not fully tested, red is untestableI think u have to enhance ur vision to see the textcuz even if it was dried, the text would prob still be blurryTriedIve tried like over 30 variations of "dry napkin" on /wiki it prob doesnt existLook i dont wanna sound ungrateful but what even is this hint?what does it tell us?At least it kinda narrows it down to it prob just being speculation abt the blanksnot actually looking for the blanksI doubt theyd reuse the thing from archwhen u need a specific amount of players meeting a set of conditions8waitthats smartlemme thinkgnIt actually does. Theres 29 amongi in the wet napkin map art.Erruption weakens the rock that relic is stuck inMakes sense lorewise thoand its logicalaverag why r u trying to indoctrinate ppl in #hunt-discussion tooWouldnt be related since it wasnt released yet when hunt startedalso hasnt been released yetLightYea there would prob be a lot less engagement and interest in the hunt if it was linear. Making it non linear was a very good changefound in api and admin's inventoryCould beThat was one of my first theories on itNah just a Cinderbatthey drop Flames used in crafting Everburning Flame minion fuelWhat part of his dialogue exactly?How would it connect to the current step tho??Obtained from Aviar and Gnyl, since it's texture is Kuudra tentacles over Sulphur and Aviar and Gnyl talk about giving Kuudra Sulphur. Prob some Sulphur related step that maybe involves the Kuudra FightWhat u testing?Its confirmed it existsSeen in API and an admin's inventoryOh smart!give to Velyna tooWhats the reasoning behind that donation valueVelynasame, but i still find the hunt kinda interestingthe problem rn is most ppl interpret this step as bruteforcing donationswhich probably it iswe should just be happy we have one, even tho its not much27I hope they make one after we solve the hunt loland that u can see how much you donated yourselfJacob was hinting at herring first and you CANT obtain napkin unless u have obtained herring the fish at least onceyesbut you cant obtain napkin unless you have obtained herring the fish at least oncealso weird sailor was the thing herring unlockedYes talon tested it on his alt without herringhowever i still believe 4202022 is the commencementand that the 8 letter blank is unrelated tk 4202022notheyre called cinderbatsso it cant be thatWhat would hint at that thoYeathat makes the most senseCould how long pleb survives without water breathing also be related? :thonking:With a rod without frailI wanna test on plhlegblast too thoNo it must be 2 pieces pogo #1 pig #2 2 pieces pig #1 pogo #2frickim not homei wont be able to log on today at allWhat he says is the formula for magical powerso hes probably unrelated350k smth for meDivan Drill is only a single stepif right conditions are met, all you need for chestplate is talking to arch no matter whatYea in one of the posts from last year they said nether revamp will be late/end game or somethingit totally makes senseAlso the new kuudra tiers wont be able to just be beaten by players with combat 24Also the divan drill req makes sense lorewiseDivan drill has highest breaking power so it breaks the strong volcano rock kuudra relic is stuck in while the rock is also weakened by the strongest volcano erruptionnoOnly divan drill and only divan drilloh so thats how averag knew i visited him that one timeIce bait melts in lava so napkin becomes wetonly explanationyo ggWhat would hint at pristine thowe currently believe it revolves around believer as all steps before didyeaits a metaphoreits 29 amongusesthe 2nd blank is probably 29yesnicegm pigi have 1b of my gdrag bankwilling to waste it all:yep:all of usi love the 😄it look funi idk whyanyways back to le funi :follower:ikri love big pepeselfieok now lets actually talk about the donation valuestotal "herrings"-391 81 -702 believer coords8 digits.yes remove the -thats serious dedicationu deserve #1i donated smth around 190mso fargnwhats next? || h*m radio?||make it so mods, hunters, VETERANS :2Sunglasses:, seasoned get it firstnobad ideaalso as seen from weslay's prvs msg hunter channel isnt some big gatekeeping conspiracy lmfaoits just another hunt discussiontbh it would just result in mafin @hunterperson "random words here" in #hunt-discussion or smth lolfrom viewing itits most likely 29its a metaphorfor when were very close to the solutioni said i will donate when i can log on then chaos said the value wouldnt make sensebut that doesnt matter anymorewe have the herringlol pig got jacobruby moment'djacob, did anyone try to bring a sea emperor to jake today?knew ithintin time"big fish" (space included)only part of sailor that wasnt usedbig fish try big fishbai (⌐■_■)/ok were closelike rlly closefeels like the time we were doin archwere techincally  closer than before since we know its not 4202022thats my interpretationwere still closer than b4thats the pointbut the number has alr been used upthe meaning of itsame questionwhatso for 8 letter one r we looking for a number or word cuz i dont have many ideas for numbers rnhmwouldve jacob also said it if the herring wasnt publicly discovered but by only 1 personwhat would that step be tho?it all points to the equation's result being a donation valuewhy do you keep posting this image7292022 for commencement igHerring was foundyeabut what number would be in napkinexcept 29ice bait melt in lava make water so napkin is wet from that igwe thought he was related to dark auctionat firstby this logic wetness and water should be relatedwet napkin was caught in lavaso id relate it to lava morewdym disguised as a fishbig fish from sailor dialogue?i still think that isnt napkinnor kuudrayebut we thought we were fishing for kuudracuz big fish was vaguewe didnt know what we were fishing forkuudra? a fish? something entirely else?sailor wrote the scribbling on napkin right?i still think like with herring being given to us by kuudra the whole believer step is a test by kuudra to us if we are worthy of itand sailor is literally just a form kuudra took after the fightye most likelyand a long time ago tooi dont think we should look into why obfuscated bits are obfuscatedu dont need to donate 1m to get a plebu just fish one up then donate 4202022 and receive herringbut u have to bring the plhlegblast to the believerwait are you testing somethingor trynna get herringfull squid gear wont do anythingjust squid hat makes chances higherMandiblecraftJacob confirmed that number wont be used anymoreYesBut it should be kept as "released in the future" so people dont connect it to the hunt as it was released 6 months after hunt startedu have to manually mine it all by yourselftakes around 20h with the maxed setup for it which is listed on the awesome website made by carrot and duggyKuudra Archeologist is already solved also you csnt get any souls from mobs in kuudra fightWe believed it was the 4202022, although that was disproven by jacobrubywe currently believe the commencement is 7292022aka the date we discovered herring the fishsea emperor to jake is a metaphorfor when were close to the solutionThis isnt tho, this hunt has multiple long and complicated stepsYesbut sea emperor to jake wouldnt be use in this hunt, its simply a metaphorimo 7292022 as commencement isnt rlly complicateddate herring was found makes senseWe need a simple solution to the 8 digit one thoAlso relates to the current step, we alr solved 3 npcs and those wont be used againTides hint still makes no sense imoand jacob did say he wanted to make a "useless" hintWe alr knew thoseb4 the solutioni performed most tests with thosewe were focusing on "big fish" too muchit was just a hint we have to fish, not use a fish like herring or fish up kuudrawe know that the obfuscated bits are numbers 100%kuudra believer info list updated with the newest infoOh i made so much money from doing that...Test what?lol seeing sm1 get the blessing b4 claiming napkin in the wildvery funi4202022that number has alr been used thoJacobRuby confirmed it wont be used againUhhhnothing rllyits double backwardsyes you havent seen the pre-herring suffering👍that new rule isnt even in #roles yetwhats the time for u rnwere still on kuudra believerwere 3/6 of the stuff neededso far we got kuudra follower leggings, kuudra follower boots, kuudra follower chestplate then for the believer step herring the fish and wet napkinbeliever step leads to kuudra follower helmetthen there are 2 more steps one for kuudra follower artifact and one for the kuudra mandiblewe dont have kuudra tali yetkuudra relic is a quest itemnot an accessorythe relic is only used to get kuudra follower leggingsnothing elseand mandiblewere 3/6nahartifact is prob the protestersi mean the texture is *LITERALLY* tentacles over sulphurhe comes back on tuesdayso in 3dyou can hunt without hunting in gameo7its hard to really hunt in this stepbecause pig is the one who should donate all valuesall hunting i can rlly do is suggesting ideas/values rn with believerpig while ur updating that in #roles, please for the love of god fix the "To earn this role, you just need to spend some time chatting in hunt-discussion or off-topic" for rookie rolealso ik only chaos can update it cuz they made the og post but stillhunting will be much easier at the artifact stepyea just putting together values for pig to testthats the most we can do rnm a n(rel)herring alr has a useit unlocked sailorNoWere close thoyes, also the solution wouldnt be just as simple as that7282022 could work but we can never know if sm1 got herring b4so yea 6112019 is our best bet rnYeaJacob is a credible source thohmyea thats an interesting theory that should be looked into. 1M makes a lot of sense as commencement.Its basically the start of sailor stepAlso i dont think blazing fortress related things would be reused, as we alr had that in the loremaster stepProblem with flaming sword is that its unobtainablerather try testing with blade of the volcanoits obtainable and eerily similar to the sword with emblems that velyna mentionsYea it became unobtainable with crimson isle updateVanquished magma necklace iircIn the collectionRekindled isnt in magma cream collection lolrekindled ember is made from rekindled ember fragsdropped by the new magma bossold ember armor works with arch, but so does rekindledbut yea old ember is unobtainablerod was unobtainable since pets v2in may 2020 lolAnyways i think we should look into az's ideaof 1000000 being the commencementin discussionyea prob thatelbuod comes at the endIts in #hunt-announcementsjust scroll up a bit74999999 could also work but the result would prob be a huge numberi dont rlly think the number needed for helmet would be more than 100myeabelow 50m makes the most senseCould be higher tho, tux was 75m after allThe 1m idea was rlly goodWe should look into thatIt makes sense as commencementcuz its the start of the sailor stepwe all pretty much agree the 2 digit one is 29, right?we need a good reliable 8 digit number29 makes sense, we need a 8 digit number that would also make sense4202022 was confirmed to not be used1000000 (credit to az)10132022 is 8 digit too so hmmmmaybe for 8 digit one 10132022and 1m for commencement29 for 2 digitnapkinYea that was my first idea for commencementbut we can never be sure if sm1 found it b4 usIg we can trust it thenwhat would be the 8 digit one tho7282022 would make more sense for commencement thogngg, ur alr halfway there!Prob dojoss the coords then go to them at a higher y lvlYea it 100% isnt cuz it was released after crimsongglike 20hYea were closer than everwe have confirmation 4202022 is not used and confirmation the blanks are 100% numbers1000000?YeaI currently believe its our best bet for commencementEither 1000000 or 6112019 imoMost likely 29, nothing has been confirmed thoRelated to the wet napkin item and kuudra believer npcWe know the blanks in wet napkin are numbersthe commencement isnt 4202022 and the number 4202022 wont be used againWe currently have the ideas of 1000000 and 6112019 for the commencementWhile most of us agree the 2 digit blank is 29, which is the number of among us characters on the wet napkin map art (im not joking)We believe after donating the right value we will get the helmet in the same fashion we got

:pain:throw on porcu cant reforge it :kekw:im looking into values relating to said hint npcsno pigplease nobtw match sticks are quite literally "burning", not just vaguely burning so i dont think thats ittoo far of a stretchpig, please calm downwhich kind ofi also dont think erruptions would be reused, even if it was just any eruptionwhat do u guys think thovelyna values :yep:if the npc is velyna, its most likely blade of the volcanono, its speculation that its an npcthat the hint was referring to an npcthats why im looking into values relating to npcs of interestnono dates are useda number i found is 5000, npc sell price of blade of the volcanono idea where to incorporate it thoits digitsnot wordnop, no official statement on coordsjacob confirmed itduggy or carrot's about me for the official hunt websitemaybe stats of blade of the volcano?or the npc sell priceguys when hunting for the vaguely burning thing, keep in mind were looking for a value/digitim giving up on porc :sadge:velyna, still has potentialbarb npc who talks about listening to firebarb colosseumtheres a colosseum in dragontail.hmmm maybe how much essence u get from salvaging blade of the volcanoyes it has exclusive dialogue if you have beaten kuudra at least onceyesdo you see the patternvelyna was being looked into before the hintthanks for ur dedication to the hunt, spending like 60m for a testhmobsidian skinhmmmmPorcanyonesome have faction locked dialogue thobut npcs with faction locked dialogue shouldnt be looked intoi rember :pain:i wanted to do it, but wasnt fishing 27 yet lolalso

itYes, no datesanother problem is, that it wouldnt be something that includes "burning" in the namesince its "vaguely burning"imagine herring was a herring and amogi meant nothing:sadge:fandom wiki said greg has 20 base mf, while it has 10 base mfi hate fandom wiki from then on so much(it made me buy greg)wait i just realized i had that too 💀i turned it on like months ago in a survival world for

At one end of it acoloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of aman of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsomefeatures. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Evenat the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electriccurrent was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drivein preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, wentslowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite thelift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It wasone of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you aboutwhen you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which hadsomething to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from anoblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surfaceof the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sanksomewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument(the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way ofshutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frailfigure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overallswhich were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his facenaturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razorblades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down inthe street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper intospirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, thereseemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plasteredeverywhere. The black-moustachio'd face gazed down from every commandingcorner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHERIS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep intoWinston's own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner,flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering thesingle word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down betweenthe roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away againwith a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people'swindows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Policemattered.Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling awayabout pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. Thetelescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winstonmade, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it,moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metalplaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of courseno way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. Howoften, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individualwire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody allthe time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wantedto. You had to live--did live, from habit that became instinct--in theassumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except indarkness, every movement scrutinized.Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though, as hewell knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry ofTruth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste--this was London, chiefcity of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces ofOceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell himwhether London had always been quite like this. Were there always thesevistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up withbaulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofswith corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and thewillow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where thebombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid coloniesof wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could notremember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-littableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.The Ministry of Truth--Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the officiallanguage of Oceania. For an account of its structure and etymology seeAppendix.]--was startlingly different from any other object in sight. Itwas an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaringup, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winstonstood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face inelegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHThe Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms aboveground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about Londonthere were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. Socompletely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roofof Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. Theywere the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatusof government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itselfwith news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry ofPeace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, whichmaintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsiblefor economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv,and Miniplenty.The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windowsin it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, norwithin half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter excepton official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze ofbarbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Eventhe streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-facedguards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into theexpression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facingthe telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leavingthe Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in thecanteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen excepta hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow'sbreakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquidwith a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oilysmell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful,nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. Thestuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had thesensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. Thenext moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the worldbegan to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packetmarked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon thetobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful.He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stoodto the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out apenholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with ared back and a marbled cover.For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusualposition. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, whereit could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite thewindow. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winstonwas now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably beenintended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping wellback, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, sofar as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayedin his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusualgeography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was nowabout to do.But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out ofthe drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper,a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured forat least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was mucholder than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy littlejunk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did notnow remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desireto possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops('dealing on the free market', it was called), but the rule was notstrictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces andrazor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. Hehad given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped insideand bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not consciousof wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily homein his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromisingpossession.The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal(nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detectedit was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at leastby twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib intothe penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaicinstrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one,furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that thebeautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib insteadof being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writingby hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everythinginto the speak-write which was of course impossible for his presentpurpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just asecond. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was thedecisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:   April 4th, 1984.He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. Tobegin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. Itmust be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age wasthirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; butit was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary?For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round thedoubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against theNewspeak word DOUBLETHINK. For the first time the magnitude of what he hadundertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? Itwas of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present,in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it,and his predicament would be meaningless.For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The telescreen hadchanged over to strident military music. It was curious that he seemednot merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to haveforgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weekspast he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossedhis mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writingwould be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminablerestless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally foryears. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. Moreoverhis varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it,because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were tickingby. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in frontof him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music,and a slight booziness caused by the gin.Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of whathe was setting down. His small but childish handwriting straggled up anddown the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even itsfull stops:   April 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One very goodone of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean.Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim awaywith a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in thewater like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights,then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank assuddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting withlaughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with ahelicopter hovering over it. there was a middle-aged woman might have beena jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old inher arms. little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between herbreasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman puttingher arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with frightherself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thoughther arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a 20kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood.then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right upinto the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed itup and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down inthe prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shoutingthey didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aintright not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned herout i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the prolessay typical prole reaction they never----Winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. He didnot know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. But the curiousthing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory hadclarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal towriting it down. It was, he now realized, because of this other incidentthat he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so nebulous couldbe said to happen.It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winstonworked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping themin the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation forthe Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of themiddle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spokento, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he oftenpassed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that sheworked in the Fiction Department. Presumably--since he had sometimes seenher with oily hands and carrying a spanner--she had some mechanical jobon one of the novel-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, ofabout twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athleticmovements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, waswound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough tobring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from thevery first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of theatmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and generalclean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He dislikednearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was alwaysthe women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigotedadherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies andnosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impressionof being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridorshe gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right intohim and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had evencrossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That,it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiaruneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenevershe was anywhere near him.The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party andholder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dimidea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of peopleround the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party memberapproaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse,humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had acertain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles onhis nose which was curiously disarming--in some indefinable way, curiouslycivilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in suchterms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering hissnuffbox. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as manyyears. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intriguedby the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter'sphysique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhapsnot even a belief, merely a hope--that O'Brien's political orthodoxy wasnot perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again,perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, butsimply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being aperson that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen andget him alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify thisguess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment O'Brien glancedat his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidentlydecided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate wasover. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away.A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston wasbetween them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.The next moment a hideous, grinding screech, as of some monstrous machinerunning without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room.It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at theback of one's neck. The Hate had started.As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, hadflashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among theaudience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear anddisgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leadingfigures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, andthen had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemnedto death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmesof the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none inwhich Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor,the earliest defiler of the Party's purity. All subsequent crimes againstthe Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations,sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was stillalive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea,under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even--so it wasoccasionally rumoured--in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face ofGoldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face,with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard--aclever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senilesilliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacleswas perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had asheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attackupon the doctrines of the Party--an attack so exaggerated and perverse thata child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausibleenough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, lesslevel-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing BigBrother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demandingthe immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedomof speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought,he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed--and allthis in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of thehabitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeakwords: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normallyuse in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as tothe reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head onthe telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army--rowafter row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swamup to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by othersexactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed thebackground to Goldstein's bleating voice.Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollableexclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying powerof the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides,the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and angerautomatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasiaor Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it wasgenerally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that althoughGoldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and athousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers,in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to thegeneral gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were--in spite of all this,his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupeswaiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteursacting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police.He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network ofconspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, itsname was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terriblebook, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the authorand which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without atitle. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knewof such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood norTHE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention ifthere was a way of avoiding it.In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping up anddown in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effortto drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The littlesandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening andshutting like that of a landed fish. Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed.He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling andquivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. Thedark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!'and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at thescreen. It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continuedinexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with theothers and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. Thehorrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged toact a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joiningin. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideousecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smashfaces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group ofpeople like an electric current, turning one even against one's will intoa grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was anabstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object toanother like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatredwas not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, againstBig Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments hisheart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardianof truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant hewas at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldsteinseemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of BigBrother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, aninvincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordesof Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, andthe doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinisterenchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structureof civilization.It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or thatby a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which onewrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeededin transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-hairedgirl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her nakedto a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He wouldravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before,moreover, he realized WHY it was that he hated her. He hated her becauseshe was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed withher and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, whichseemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odiousscarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actualsheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.Then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemedto be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, andseeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of thepeople in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. Butin the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, thehostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired,black-moustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast thatit almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that areuttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually butrestoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of BigBrother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stoodout in bold capitals:  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHBut the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on thescreen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs wastoo vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flungherself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With atremulous murmur that sounded like 'My Saviour!' she extended her armstowards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparentthat she was uttering a prayer.At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow,rhythmical chant of 'B-B!...B-B!'--over and over again, very slowly, with along pause between the first 'B' and the second--a heavy, murmurous sound,somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear thestamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much asthirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard inmoments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdomand majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis,a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he couldnot help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of'B-B!...B-B!' always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with therest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, tocontrol your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctivereaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which theexpression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And it wasexactly at this moment that the significant thing happened--if, indeed,it did happen.Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stood up. He had takenoff his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose withhis characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second whentheir eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew--yes, heKNEW!--that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakablemessage had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and thethoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. 'I amwith you,' O'Brien seemed to be saying to him. 'I know precisely what youare feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.But don't worry, I am on your side!' And then the flash of intelligencewas gone, and O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Suchincidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep alive in himthe belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of theParty. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true afterall--perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spiteof the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that theBrotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some daysnot. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anythingor nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatorywalls--once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the handwhich had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was allguesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to hiscubicle without looking at O'Brien again. The idea of following up theirmomentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivablydangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, twoseconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end ofthe story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness inwhich one had to live.Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a belch. The ginwas rising from his stomach.His eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that while he sat helplesslymusing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action. And it wasno longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slidvoluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals--  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHERover and over again, filling half a page.He could not help feeling a twinge of panic. It was absurd, since thewriting of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initialact of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out thespoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. Whether hewrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he refrained from writing it, madeno difference. Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not goon with it, made no difference. The Thought Police would get him just thesame. He had committed--would still have committed, even if he had neverset pen to paper--the essential crime that contained all others in itself.Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could beconcealed for ever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even foryears, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.It was always at night--the arrests invariably happened at night. Thesudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lightsglaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. In the vastmajority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. Peoplesimply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed from theregisters, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, yourone-time existence was denied and then forgotten. You were abolished,annihilated: VAPORIZED was the usual word.For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began writing in ahurried untidy scrawl:   theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck idont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of theneck i dont care down with big brother----He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid downthe pen. The next moment he started violently. There was a knocking atthe door.Already! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it wasmight go away after a single attempt. But no, the knocking was repeated.The worst thing of all would be to delay. His heart was thumping like adrum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless. He gotup and moved heavily towards the door.Chapter 2As he put his hand to the door-knob Winston saw that he had left thediary open on the table. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written all over it,in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. It was aninconceivably stupid thing to have done. But, he realized, even in hispanic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the bookwhile the ink was wet.He drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly a warm wave of reliefflowed through him. A colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hairand a lined face, was standing outside.'Oh, comrade,' she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, 'I thought Iheard you come in. Do you think you could come across and have a look atour kitchen sink? It's got blocked up and----'It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor. ('Mrs' wasa word somewhat discountenanced by the Party--you were supposed to calleveryone 'comrade'--but with some women one used it instinctively.) She wasa woman of about thirty, but looking much older. One had the impressionthat there was dust in the creases of her face. Winston followed her downthe passage. These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation.Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and werefalling to pieces. The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls,the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there wassnow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was notclosed down altogether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what youcould do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees whichwere liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years.'Of course it's only because Tom isn't home,' said Mrs Parsons vaguely.The Parsons' flat was bigger than Winston's, and dingy in a differentway. Everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though theplace had just been visited by some large violent animal. Gamesimpedimenta--hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves, a burst football, a pair ofsweaty shorts turned inside out--lay all over the floor, and on thetable there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books.On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, anda full-sized poster of Big Brother. There was the usual boiled-cabbagesmell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharperreek of sweat, which--one knew this at the first sniff, though it washard to say how--was the sweat of some person not present at the moment.In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper wastrying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuingfrom the telescreen.'It's the children,' said Mrs Parsons, casting a half-apprehensive glanceat the door. 'They haven't been out today. And of course----'She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. The kitchensink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smeltworse than ever of cabbage. Winston knelt down and examined the angle-jointof the pipe. He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which wasalways liable to start him coughing. Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly.'Of course if Tom was home he'd put it right in a moment,' she said.'He loves anything like that. He's ever so good with his hands, Tom is.'Parsons was Winston's fellow-employee at the Ministry of Truth. He wasa fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecileenthusiasms--one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges onwhom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Partydepended. At thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from theYouth League, and before graduating into the Youth League he had managed tostay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age. At the Ministryhe was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was notrequired, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the SportsCommittee and all the other committees engaged in organizing communityhikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntaryactivities generally. He would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffsof his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the Community Centre everyevening for the past four years. An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort ofunconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him aboutwherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone.'Have you got a spanner?' said Winston, fiddling with the nut on theangle-joint.'A spanner,' said Mrs Parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate. 'I don'tknow, I'm sure. Perhaps the children----'There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as thechildren charged into the living-room. Mrs Parsons brought the spanner.Winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hairthat had blocked up the pipe. He cleaned his fingers as best he could inthe cold water from the tap and went back into the other room.'Up with your hands!' yelled a savage voice.A handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the tableand was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his small sister,about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood.Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and redneckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies. Winston raised his handsabove his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boy'sdemeanour, that it was not altogether a game.'You're a traitor!' yelled the boy. 'You're a thought-criminal! You're aEurasian spy! I'll shoot you, I'll vaporize you, I'll send you to the saltmines!'Suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting 'Traitor!' and'Thought-criminal!' the little girl imitating her brother in everymovement. It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling oftiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort ofcalculating ferocity in the boy's eye, a quite evident desire to hit orkick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so.It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston thought.Mrs Parsons' eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children, and backagain. In the better light of the living-room he noticed with interestthat there actually was dust in the creases of her face.'They do get so noisy,' she said. 'They're disappointed because theycouldn't go to see the hanging, that's what it is. I'm too busy to takethem. and Tom won't be back from work in time.''Why can't we go and see the hanging?' roared the boy in his huge voice.'Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!' chanted the littlegirl, still capering round.Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in thePark that evening, Winston remembered. This happened about once a month,and was a popular spectacle. Children always clamoured to be taken to seeit. He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door. But he had notgone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck anagonizingly painful blow. It was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbedinto him. He spun round just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her sonback into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.'Goldstein!' bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. But what moststruck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman's greyish face.Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at thetable again, still rubbing his neck. The music from the telescreen hadstopped. Instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a sort ofbrutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortresswhich had just been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands.With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life ofterror. Another year, two years, and they would be watching her nightand day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays werehorrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations asthe Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages,and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against thediscipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party andeverything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, thehiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worshipof Big Brother--it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All theirferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, againstforeigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normalfor people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And withgood reason, for hardly a week passed in which 'The Times' did not carrya paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak--'child hero'was the phrase generally used--had overheard some compromising remarkand denounced its parents to the Thought Police.The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked up his penhalf-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to writein the diary. Suddenly he began thinking of O'Brien again.Years ago--how long was it? Seven years it must be--he had dreamed that hewas walking through a pitch-dark room. And someone sitting to one side ofhim had said as he passed: 'We shall meet in the place where there is nodarkness.' It was said very quietly, almost casually--a statement, not acommand. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was that at thetime, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. It wasonly later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. Hecould not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream thathe had seen O'Brien for the first time, nor could he remember when he hadfirst identified the voice as O'Brien's. But at any rate the identificationexisted. It was O'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.Winston had never been able to feel sure--even after this morning's flashof the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O'Brien was a friendor an enemy. Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There was a link ofunderstanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship.'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' he had said.Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another itwould come true.The voice from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call, clear and beautiful,floated into the stagnant air. The voice continued raspingly:'Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has this moment arrivedfrom the Malabar front. Our forces in South India have won a gloriousvictory. I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting maywell bring the war within measurable distance of its end. Here is thenewsflash----'Bad news coming, thought Winston. And sure enough, following on a gorydescription of the annihilation of a Eurasian army, with stupendous figuresof killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next week,the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.Winston belched again. The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling.The telescreen--perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown thememory of the lost chocolate--crashed into 'Oceania, 'tis for thee'. Youwere supposed to stand to attention. However, in his present position hewas invisible.'Oceania, 'tis for thee' gave way to lighter music. Winston walked over tothe window, keeping his back to the telescreen. The day was still cold andclear. Somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberatingroar. About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London atpresent.Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and theword INGSOC fitfully appeared and vanished. Ingsoc. The sacred principlesof Ingsoc. Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past. He felt asthough he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in amonstrous world where he himself was the monster. He was alone. The pastwas dead, the future was unimaginable. What certainty had he that a singlehuman creature now living was on his side? And what way of knowing that thedominion of the Party would not endure FOR EVER? Like an answer, the threeslogans on the white face of the Ministry of Truth came back to him:  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHHe took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket. There, too, in tinyclear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face ofthe coin the head of Big Brother. Even from the coin the eyes pursued you.On coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and onthe wrappings of a cigarette packet--everywhere. Always the eyes watchingyou and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, working or eating,indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed--no escape. Nothing was yourown except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the Ministry of Truth,with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of afortress. His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. It was toostrong, it could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not batterit down. He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary. For thefuture, for the past--for an age that might be imaginary. And in front ofhim there lay not death but annihilation. The diary would be reduced toashes and himself to vapour. Only the Thought Police would read what he hadwritten, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory. How couldyou make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even ananonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive?The telescreen struck fourteen. He must leave in ten minutes. He had to beback at work by fourteen-thirty.Curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him.He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear. But solong as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken.It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried onthe human heritage. He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote:   To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when menare different from one another and do not live alone--to a time when truthexists and what is done cannot be undone:   From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age ofBig Brother, from the age of doublethink--greetings!He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that it was only now,when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had takenthe decisive step. The consequences of every act are included in the actitself. He wrote:   Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stayalive as long as possible. Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained.It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. Some nosing zealotin the Ministry (a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-hairedwoman or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department) might startwondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he hadused an old-fashioned pen, WHAT he had been writing--and then drop a hintin the appropriate quarter. He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbedthe ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped your skin likesandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose.He put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite useless to think ofhiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence hadbeen discovered. A hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious. With thetip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust anddeposited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shakenoff if the book was moved.Chapter 3Winston was dreaming of his mother.He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother haddisappeared. She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slowmovements and magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered more vaguelyas dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston rememberedespecially the very thin soles of his father's shoes) and wearingspectacles. The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in oneof the first great purges of the fifties.At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him,with his young sister in her arms. He did not remember his sister at all,except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes.Both of them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterraneanplace--the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave--but itwas a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards.They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through thedarkening water. There was still air in the saloon, they could still seehim and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into thegreen waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever.He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death,and they were down there because he was up here. He knew it and they knewit, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no reproacheither in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that theymust die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part ofthe unavoidable order of things.He could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that insome way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to hisown. It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristicdream scenery, are a continuation of one's intellectual life, and in whichone becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuableafter one is awake. The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that hismother's death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful ina way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to theancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship,and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing toknow the reason. His mother's memory tore at his heart because she had diedloving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, andbecause somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to aconception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, hesaw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, butno dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed tosee in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at himthrough the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening whenthe slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. The landscape that he waslooking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certainwhether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts hecalled it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with afoot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the raggedhedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees wereswaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in densemasses like women's hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight,there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in thepools under the willow trees.The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. Withwhat seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung themdisdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desirein him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instantwas admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside.With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture,a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and theThought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendidmovement of the arm. That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time.Winston woke up with the word 'Shakespeare' on his lips.The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued onthe same note for thirty seconds. It was nought seven fifteen, getting-uptime for office workers. Winston wrenched his body out of bed--naked, fora member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually,and a suit of pyjamas was 600--and seized a dingy singlet and a pair ofshorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin inthree minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fitwhich nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungsso completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his backand taking a series of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort ofthe cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching.'Thirty to forty group!' yapped a piercing female voice. 'Thirty to fortygroup! Take your places, please. Thirties to forties!'Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which theimage of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic andgym-shoes, had already appeared.'Arms bending and stretching!' she rapped out. 'Take your time by me. ONE,two, three, four! ONE, two, three, four! Come on, comrades, put a bit oflife into it! ONE, two, three four! ONE two, three, four!...'The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Winston's mind theimpression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exerciserestored it somewhat. As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth,wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered properduring the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward intothe dim period of his early childhood. It was extraordinarily difficult.Beyond the late fifties everything faded. When there were no externalrecords that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lostits sharpness. You remembered huge events which had quite probably nothappened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able torecapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which youcould assign nothing. Everything had been different then. Even the names ofcountries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One,for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been calledEngland or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always beencalled London.Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not beenat war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval ofpeace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an airraid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the timewhen the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester. He did not remember the raiditself, but he did remember his father's hand clutching his own as theyhurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and rounda spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so weariedhis legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest. Hismother, in her slow, dreamy way, was following a long way behind them. Shewas carrying his baby sister--or perhaps it was only a bundle of blanketsthat she was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been bornthen. Finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he hadrealized to be a Tube station.There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, and otherpeople, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one abovethe other. Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place onthe floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side byside on a bunk. The old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cappushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes wereblue and full of tears. He reeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of hisskin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears wellingfrom his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly drunk he was alsosuffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. In his childishway Winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyondforgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened. It also seemedto him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the old man loved--a littlegranddaughter, perhaps--had been killed. Every few minutes the old man keptrepeating:'We didn't ought to 'ave trusted 'em. I said so, Ma, didn't I? That's whatcomes of trusting 'em. I said so all along. We didn't ought to 'ave trustedthe buggers.'But which buggers they didn't ought to have trusted Winston could not nowremember.Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictlyspeaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during hischildhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, someof which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the wholeperiod, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have beenutterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever mademention of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, forexample, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia andin alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it everadmitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along differentlines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceaniahad been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that wasmerely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess becausehis memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change ofpartners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: thereforeOceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment alwaysrepresented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or futureagreement with him was impossible.The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth time as heforced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they weregyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to begood for the back muscles)--the frightening thing was that it might all betrue. If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this orthat event, IT NEVER HAPPENED--that, surely, was more terrifying than meretorture and death?The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He,Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as shorta time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in hisown consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if allothers accepted the lie which the Party imposed--if all records told thesame tale--then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controlsthe past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls thepresent controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its naturealterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true fromeverlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed wasan unending series of victories over your own memory. 'Reality control',they called it: in Newspeak, 'doublethink'.'Stand easy!' barked the instructress, a little more genially.Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air.His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. To knowand not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while tellingcarefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions whichcancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both ofthem, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claimto it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was theguardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, thento draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, andthen promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same processto the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously toinduce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious ofthe act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.The instructress had called them to attention again. 'And now let's seewhich of us can touch our toes!' she said enthusiastically. 'Right overfrom the hips, please, comrades. ONE-two! ONE-two!...'Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way fromhis heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughingfit. The half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations. The past, hereflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. Forhow could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed norecord outside your own memory? He tried to remember in what year he hadfirst heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at sometime in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Partyhistories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of theRevolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been graduallypushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulousworld of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in theirstrange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in greatgleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides. There was noknowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented. Winstoncould not even remember at what date the Party itself had come intoexistence. He did not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak form--'English Socialism',that is to say--it had been current earlier. Everything melted into mist.Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was nottrue, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that theParty had invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his earliestchildhood. But you could prove nothing. There was never any evidence. Justonce in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentaryproof of the falsification of an historical fact. And on that occasion----'Smith!' screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.!Yes, YOU! Bend lower, please! You can do better than that. You're nottrying. Lower, please! THAT'S better, comrade. Now stand at ease, thewhole squad, and watch me.'A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston's body. His faceremained completely inscrutable. Never show dismay! Never show resentment!A single flicker of the eyes could give you away. He stood watching whilethe instructress raised her arms above her head and--one could not saygracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency--bent over andtucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes.'THERE, comrades! THAT'S how I want to see you doing it. Watch me again.I'm thirty-nine and I've had four children. Now look.' She bent over again.'You see MY knees aren't bent. You can all do it if you want to,' she addedas she straightened herself up. 'Anyone under forty-five is perfectlycapable of touching his toes. We don't all have the privilege of fightingin the front line, but at least we can all keep fit. Remember our boys onthe Malabar front! And the sailors in the Floating Fortresses! Just thinkwhat THEY have to put up with. Now try again. That's better, comrade,that's MUCH better,' she added encouragingly as Winston, with a violentlunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the firsttime in several years.Chapter 4With the deep, unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of thetelescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day's work started,Winston pulled the speakwrite towards him, blew the dust from itsmouthpiece, and put on his spectacles. Then he unrolled and clippedtogether four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out ofthe pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk.In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of thespeakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, alarger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach ofWinston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This lastwas for the disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands ortens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but atshort intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamedmemory holes. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, oreven when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automaticaction to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in,whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormousfurnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled. Eachcontained a message of only one or two lines, in the abbreviatedjargon--not actually Newspeak, but consistinglargely of Newspeak words--which was used in the Ministry for internalpurposes. They ran:times 17.3.84 bb speech malreported africa rectifytimes 19.12.83 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify current issuetimes 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectifytimes 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewritefullwise upsub antefilingWith a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth message aside.It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last.The other three were routine matters, though the second one would probablymean some tedious wading through lists of figures.Winston dialled 'back numbers' on the telescreen and called for theappropriate issues of 'The Times', which slid out of the pneumatic tubeafter only a few minutes' delay. The messages he had received referred toarticles or news items which for one reason or another it was thoughtnecessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. Forexample, it appeared from 'The Times' of the seventeenth of March that BigBrother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the SouthIndian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortlybe launched in North Africa. As it happened, the Eurasian Higher Commandhad launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone. Itwas therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother's speech, insuch a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. Oragain, 'The Times' of the nineteenth of December had published the officialforecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in thefourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the NinthThree-Year Plan. Today's issue contained a statement of the actual output,from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grosslywrong. Winston's job was to rectify the original figures by making themagree with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a verysimple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As shorta time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise(a 'categorical pledge' were the official words) that there would beno reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winstonwas aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammesto twenty at the end of the present week. All that was needed was tosubstitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably benecessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped hisspeakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of 'The Times' and pushedthem into the pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly aspossible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notesthat he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to bedevoured by the flames.What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, hedid not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as allthe corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular numberof 'The Times' had been assembled and collated, that number would bereprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed onthe files in its stead. This process of continuous alteration was appliednot only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters,leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs--to every kind ofliterature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political orideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute the pastwas brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Partycould be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was anyitem of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with theneeds of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history wasa palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as wasnecessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done,to prove that any falsification had taken place. The largest section ofthe Records Department, far larger than the one on which Winston worked,consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect allcopies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been supersededand were due for destruction. A number of 'The Times' which might, becauseof changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by BigBrother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearingits original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. Books, also,were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissuedwithout any admission that any alteration had been made. Even the writteninstructions which Winston received, and which he invariably got rid ofas soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act offorgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors,misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in theinterests of accuracy.But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty'sfigures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of onepiece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealingwith had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind ofconnexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as mucha fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A greatdeal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. Forexample, the Ministry of Plenty's forecast had estimated the output ofboots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was given assixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, markedthe figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claimthat the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions wasno nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions. Verylikely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knewhow many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that everyquarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhapshalf the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with everyclass of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into ashadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had becomeuncertain.Winston glanced across the hall. In the corresponding cubicle on the otherside a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned man named Tillotson was workingsteadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very closeto the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the air of trying to keep whathe was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. He looked up,and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in Winston's direction.Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employedon. People in the Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs.In the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and itsendless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites,there were quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name,though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors orgesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in the cubicle nextto him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply attracking down and deleting from the Press the names of people who had beenvaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. There was acertain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a coupleof years earlier. And a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamycreature named Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talentfor juggling with rhymes and metres, was engaged in producing garbledversions--definitive texts, they were called--of poems which had becomeideologically offensive, but which for one reason or another were to beretained in the anthologies. And this hall, with its fifty workers orthereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in thehuge complexity of the Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were otherswarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. There werethe huge printing-shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts,and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs. Therewas the tele-programmes section with its engineers, its producers, and itsteams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. Therewere the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up listsof books and periodicals which were due for recall. There were the vastrepositories where the corrected documents were stored, and the hiddenfurnaces where the original copies were destroyed. And somewhere or other,quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who co-ordinated the wholeeffort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that thisfragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, and the otherrubbed out of existence.And the Records Department, after all, was itself only a single branch ofthe Ministry of Truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct the pastbut to supply the citizens of Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks,telescreen programmes, plays, novels--with every conceivable kind ofinformation, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a slogan,from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from a child'sspelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary. And the Ministry had not only tosupply the multifarious needs of the party, but also to repeat the wholeoperation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat. Therewas a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarianliterature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here were producedrubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime andastrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, andsentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on aspecial kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator. There was evena whole sub-section--Pornosec, it was called in Newspeak--engaged inproducing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealedpackets and which no Party member, other than those who worked on it,was permitted to look at.Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while Winston wasworking, but they were simple matters, and he had disposed of them beforethe Two Minutes Hate interrupted him. When the Hate was over he returnedto his cubicle, took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed thespeakwrite to one side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to hismain job of the morning.Winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work. Most of it was atedious routine, but included in it there were also jobs so difficult andintricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of amathematical problem--delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothingto guide you except your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and yourestimate of what the Party wanted you to say. Winston was good at this kindof thing. On occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of'The Times' leading articles, which were written entirely in Newspeak.He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier. It ran:   times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersonsrewrite fullwise upsub antefilingIn Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be rendered:The reporting of Big Brother's Order for the Day in 'The Times' of December3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non-existentpersons. Rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authoritybefore filing.Winston read through the offending article. Big Brother's Order for theDay, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of anorganization known as FFCC, which supplied cigarettes and other comfortsto the sailors in the Floating Fortresses. A certain Comrade Withers, aprominent member of the Inner Party, had been singled out for specialmention and awarded a decoration, the Order of Conspicuous Merit, SecondClass.Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given.One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in disgrace, butthere had been no report of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen.That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders tobe put on trial or even publicly denounced. The great purges involvingthousands of people, with public trials of traitors and thought-criminalswho made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed,were special show-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple ofyears. More commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of theParty simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never had thesmallest clue as to what had happened to them. In some cases they mightnot even be dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston, notcounting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another.Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In the cubicleacross the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively overhis speakwrite. He raised his head for a moment: again the hostilespectacle-flash. Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engagedon the same job as himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a pieceof work would never be entrusted to a single person: on the other hand,to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act offabrication was taking place. Very likely as many as a dozen people werenow working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said.And presently some master brain in the Inner Party would select thisversion or that, would re-edit it and set in motion the complex processesof cross-referencing that would be required, and then the chosen liewould pass into the permanent records and become truth.Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced. Perhaps it was forcorruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big Brother was merely getting rid ofa too-popular subordinate. Perhaps Withers or someone close to him hadbeen suspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps--what was likeliest ofall--the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were anecessary part of the mechanics of government. The only real clue lay inthe words 'refs unpersons', which indicated that Withers was already dead.You could not invariably assume this to be the case when people werearrested. Sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at libertyfor as much as a year or two years before being executed. Very occasionallysome person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostlyreappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds ofothers by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever. Withers,however, was already an UNPERSON. He did not exist: he had never existed.Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendencyof Big Brother's speech. It was better to make it deal with somethingtotally unconnected with its original subject.He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors andthought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent avictory at the front, or some triumph of over-production in the NinthThree-Year Plan, might complicate the records too much. What was neededwas a piece of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, readymade as it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had recentlydied in battle, in heroic circumstances. There were occasions when BigBrother devoted his Order for the Day to commemorating some humble,rank-and-file Party member whose life and death he held up as an exampleworthy to be followed. Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. It wastrue that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines ofprint and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him intoexistence.Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him andbegan dictating in Big Brother's familiar style: a style at once militaryand pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and thenpromptly answering them ('What lessons do we learn from this fact,comrades? The lesson--which is also one of the fundamental principlesof Ingsoc--that,' etc., etc.), easy to imitate.At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, asub-machine gun, and a model helicopter. At six--a year early, by a specialrelaxation of the rules--he had joined the Spies, at nine he had been atroop leader. At eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Policeafter overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminaltendencies. At seventeen he had been a district organizer of the JuniorAnti-Sex League. At nineteen he had designed a hand-grenade which hadbeen adopted by the Ministry of Peace and which, at its first trial, hadkilled thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one burst. At twenty-three he hadperished in action. Pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over theIndian Ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with hismachine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatchesand all--an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossible to contemplatewithout feelings of envy. Big Brother added a few remarks on the purityand single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy's life. He was a total abstainerand a nonsmoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium,and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the care of afamily to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty.He had no subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc, andno aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-downof spies, saboteurs, thought-criminals, and traitors generally.Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order ofConspicuous Merit: in the end he decided against it because of theunnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail.Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. Somethingseemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the same jobas himself. There was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted,but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade Ogilvy,unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck him as curious that youcould create dead men but not living ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had neverexisted in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act offorgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon thesame evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.Chapter 5In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the lunch queue jerkedslowly forward. The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. Fromthe grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sourmetallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. Onthe far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall,where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.'Just the man I was looking for,' said a voice at Winston's back.He turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked in the ResearchDepartment. Perhaps 'friend' was not exactly the right word. You did nothave friends nowadays, you had comrades: but there were some comrades whosesociety was pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist, aspecialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was one of the enormous team of expertsnow engaged in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary.He was a tiny creature, smaller than Winston, with dark hair and large,protuberant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed to searchyour face closely while he was speaking to you.'I wanted to ask you whether you'd got any razor blades,' he said.'Not one!' said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. 'I've tried all overthe place. They don't exist any longer.'Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually he had two unused oneswhich he was hoarding up. There had been a famine of them for months past.At any given moment there was some necessary article which the Party shopswere unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darningwool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present it was razor blades. You couldonly get hold of them, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively onthe 'free' market.'I've been using the same blade for six weeks,' he added untruthfully.The queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted he turned and facedSyme again. Each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the endof the counter.'Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?' said Syme.'I was working,' said Winston indifferently. 'I shall see it on theflicks, I suppose.''A very inadequate substitute,' said Syme.His mocking eyes roved over Winston's face. 'I know you,' the eyes seemedto say, 'I see through you. I know very well why you didn't go to seethose prisoners hanged.' In an intellectual way, Syme was venomouslyorthodox. He would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction ofhelicopter raids on enemy villages, and trials and confessions ofthought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the Ministry of Love.Talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjectsand entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities of Newspeak, onwhich he was authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his head alittle aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.'It was a good hanging,' said Syme reminiscently. 'I think it spoils itwhen they tie their feet together. I like to see them kicking. And aboveall, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue--a quite brightblue. That's the detail that appeals to me.''Nex', please!' yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle.Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. On to each wasdumped swiftly the regulation lunch--a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew,a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory Coffee, andone saccharine tablet.'There's a table over there, under that telescreen,' said Syme. 'Let's pickup a gin on the way.'The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. They threadedtheir way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to themetal-topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew,a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston took up hismug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped theoily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the tears out of his eyes hesuddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls ofthe stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongypinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. Neither of themspoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. From the table atWinston's left, a little behind his back, someone was talking rapidly andcontinuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, whichpierced the general uproar of the room.'How is the Dictionary getting on?' said Winston, raising his voice toovercome the noise.'Slowly,' said Syme. 'I'm on the adjectives. It's fascinating.'He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak. He pushed hispannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and hischeese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speakwithout shouting.'The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,' he said. 'We're gettingthe language into its final shape--the shape it's going to have when nobodyspeaks anything else. When we've finished with it, people like you willhave to learn it all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief jobis inventing new words. But not a bit of it! We're destroying words--scoresof them, hundreds of them, every day. We're cutting the language down tothe bone. The Eleventh Edition won't contain a single word that will becomeobsolete before the year 2050.'He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, thencontinued speaking, with a sort of pedant's passion. His thin dark facehad become animated, his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grownalmost dreamy.'It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the greatwastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nounsthat can be got rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms; there are alsothe antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which issimply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite initself. Take "good", for instance. If you have a word like "good", whatneed is there for a word like "bad"? "Ungood" will do just as well--better,because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if youwant a stronger version of "good", what sense is there in having a wholestring of vague useless words like "excellent" and "splendid" and all therest of them? "Plusgood" covers the meaning, or "doubleplusgood" if youwant something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already. butin the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else. In the end thewhole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words--inreality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston? It wasB.B.'s idea originally, of course,' he added as an afterthought.A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston's face at the mention ofBig Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack ofenthusiasm.'You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,' he said almostsadly. 'Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak. I've readsome of those pieces that you write in "The Times" occasionally. They'regood enough, but they're translations. In your heart you'd prefer to stickto Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning.You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. Do you know thatNewspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smallerevery year?'Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, nottrusting himself to speak. Syme bit off another fragment of thedark-coloured bread, chewed it briefly, and went on:'Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range ofthought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible,because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept thatcan ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaningrigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten.Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we're not far from that point. But theprocess will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every yearfewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a littlesmaller. Even now, of course, there's no reason or excuse for committingthoughtcrime. It's merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control.But in the end there won't be any need even for that. The Revolution willbe complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsocis Newspeak,' he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. 'Has it everoccurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not asingle human being will be alive who could understand such a conversationas we are having now?''Except----' began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.It had been on the tip of his tongue to say 'Except the proles,' but hechecked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not insome way unorthodox. Syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.'The proles are not human beings,' he said carelessly. 'By 2050--earlier,probably--all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The wholeliterature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare,Milton, Byron--they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changedinto something different, but actually changed into something contradictoryof what they used to be. Even the literature of the Party will change.Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like "freedom isslavery" when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The whole climateof thought will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as weunderstand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think.Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.'One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme willbe vaporized. He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks tooplainly. The Party does not like such people. One day he will disappear.It is written in his face.Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned a little sidewaysin his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At the table on his left the manwith the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. A youngwoman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her backto Winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing witheverything that he said. From time to time Winston caught some such remarkas 'I think you're so right, I do so agree with you', uttered in a youthfuland rather silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for aninstant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the man by sight,though he knew no more about him than that he held some important postin the Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscularthroat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, andbecause of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught thelight and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What wasslightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out ofhis mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Justonce Winston caught a phrase--'complete and final elimination ofGoldsteinism'--jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece,like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, aquack-quack-quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what theman was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature.He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures againstthought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against theatrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or theheroes on the Malabar front--it made no difference. Whatever it was, youcould be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc.As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down,Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being butsome kind of dummy. It was not the man's brain that was speaking, it washis larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, butit was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered inunconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon wastracing patterns in the puddle of stew. The voice from the other tablequacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.'There is a word in Newspeak,' said Syme, 'I don't know whether you knowit: DUCKSPEAK, to quack like a duck. It is one of those interesting wordsthat have two contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse,applied to someone you agree with, it is praise.'Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again. He thoughtit with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised himand slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as athought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was somethingsubtly wrong with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion,aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he wasunorthodox. He believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated BigBrother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely withsincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness ofinformation, which the ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet a faintair of disreputability always clung to him. He said things that would havebeen better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the ChestnutTree Cafe, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law, not even anunwritten law, against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe, yet the placewas somehow ill-omened. The old, discredited leaders of the Party had beenused to gather there before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself,it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. Syme'sfate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it was a fact that if Symegrasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston's, secretopinions, he would betray him instantly to the Thought Police. So wouldanybody else, for that matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was notenough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.Syme looked up. 'Here comes Parsons,' he said.Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, 'that bloody fool'.Parsons, Winston's fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions, was in fact threadinghis way across the room--a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and afroglike face. At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat atneck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. His wholeappearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that althoughhe was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not tothink of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and redneckerchief of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a picture ofdimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did,indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any otherphysical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He greeted them bothwith a cheery 'Hullo, hullo!' and sat down at the table, giving off anintense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face.His powers of sweating were extraordinary. At the Community Centre youcould always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness ofthe bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was along column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between hisfingers.'Look at him working away in the lunch hour,' said Parsons, nudgingWinston. 'Keenness, eh? What's that you've got there, old boy? Somethinga bit too brainy for me, I expect. Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why I'mchasing you. It's that sub you forgot to give me.''Which sub is that?' said Winston, automatically feeling for money. Abouta quarter of one's salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions,which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them.'For Hate Week. You know--the house-by-house fund. I'm treasurer for ourblock. We're making an all-out effort--going to put on a tremendous show.I tell you, it won't be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn't have thebiggest outfit of flags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me.'Winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which Parsonsentered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.'By the way, old boy,' he said. 'I hear that little beggar of mine let flyat you with his catapult yesterday. I gave him a good dressing-down for it.In fact I told him I'd take the catapult away if he does it again.''I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,' saidWinston.'Ah, well--what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn't it?Mischievous little beggars they are, both of them, but talk about keenness!All they think about is the Spies, and the war, of course. D'you know whatthat little girl of mine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hikeout Berkhamsted way? She got two other girls to go with her, slipped offfrom the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. Theykept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, whenthey got into Amersham, handed him over to the patrols.''What did they do that for?' said Winston, somewhat taken aback. Parsonswent on triumphantly:'My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent--might have been droppedby parachute, for instance. But here's the point, old boy. What do youthink put her on to him in the first place? She spotted he was wearing afunny kind of shoes--said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like thatbefore. So the chances were he was a foreigner. Pretty smart for a nipperof seven, eh?''What happened to the man?' said Winston.'Ah, that I couldn't say, of course. But I wouldn't be altogether surprisedif----' Parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tonguefor the explosion.'Good,' said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.'Of course we can't afford to take chances,' agreed Winston dutifully.'What I mean to say, there is a war on,' said Parsons.As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from thetelescreen just above their heads. However, it was not the proclamation ofa military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the Ministryof Plenty.'Comrades!' cried an eager youthful voice. 'Attention, comrades! We haveglorious news for you. We have won the battle for production! Returns nowcompleted of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that thestandard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the pastyear. All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneousdemonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices andparaded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to BigBrother for the new, happy life which his wise leadership has bestowedupon us. Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs----'The phrase 'our new, happy life' recurred several times. It had been afavourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attentioncaught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity,a sort of edified boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he wasaware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had luggedout a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco.With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible tofill a pipe to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which heheld carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow andhe had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears tothe remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of thetelescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thankBig Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. Andonly yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration wasto be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that they couldswallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsonsswallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creatureat the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furiousdesire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest thatlast week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too--in some morecomplex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, ALONEin the possession of a memory?The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. Ascompared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses,more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters,more books, more babies--more of everything except disease, crime, andinsanity. Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything waswhizzing rapidly upwards. As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken uphis spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled acrossthe table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. He meditatedresentfully on the physical texture of life. Had it always been likethis? Had food always tasted like this? He looked round the canteen.A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact ofinnumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so closetogether that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays,coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and asourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew anddirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sortof protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you hada right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatlydifferent. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had neverbeen quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes thatwere not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety,rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces,bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettesinsufficient--nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. And though,of course, it grew worse as one's body aged, was it not a sign that thiswas NOT the natural order of things, if one's heart sickened at thediscomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickinessof one's socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the grittysoap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange eviltastes? Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kindof ancestral memory that things had once been different?He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was ugly, and wouldstill have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blueoveralls. On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small,curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyesdarting suspicious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thoughtWinston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical typeset up by the Party as an ideal--tall muscular youths and deep-bosomedmaidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree--existed and evenpredominated. Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of peoplein Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured. It was curious how thatbeetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growingstout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, andfat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed toflourish best under the dominion of the Party.The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet calland gave way to tinny music. Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by thebombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.'The Ministry of Plenty's certainly done a good job this year,' he saidwith a knowing shake of his head. 'By the way, Smith old boy, I supposeyou haven't got any razor blades you can let me have?''Not one,' said Winston. 'I've been using the same blade for six weeksmyself.''Ah, well--just thought I'd ask you, old boy.''Sorry,' said Winston.The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during theMinistry's announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. For somereason Winston suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with herwispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. Within two years thosechildren would be denouncing her to the Thought Police. Mrs Parsons wouldbe vaporized. Syme would be vaporized. Winston would be vaporized. O'Brienwould be vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.The eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized.The little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthinecorridors of Ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. And the girlwith dark hair, the girl from the Fiction Department--she would never bevaporized either. It seemed to him that he knew instinctively who wouldsurvive and who would perish: though just what it was that made forsurvival, it was not easy to say.At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. Thegirl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. Itwas the girl with dark hair. She was looking at him in a sidelong way, butwith curious intensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked awayagain.The sweat started out on Winston's backbone. A horrible pang of terrorwent through him. It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagginguneasiness behind. Why was she watching him? Why did she keep following himabout? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been atthe table when he arrived, or had come there afterwards. But yesterday, atany rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind himwhen there was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real object hadbeen to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough.His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a memberof the Thought Police, but then it was precisely the amateur spy who wasthe greatest danger of all. He did not know how long she had been lookingat him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was possiblethat his features had not been perfectly under control. It was terriblydangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public placeor within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away.A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering toyourself--anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, ofhaving something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression onyour face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example)was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in Newspeak:FACECRIME, it was called.The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after all she was notreally following him about, perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat soclose to him two days running. His cigarette had gone out, and he laid itcarefully on the edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work,if he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at the nexttable was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely he would be in thecellars of the Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette endmust not be wasted. Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed itaway in his pocket. Parsons had begun talking again.'Did I ever tell you, old boy,' he said, chuckling round the stem of hispipe, 'about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the oldmarket-woman's skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a posterof B.B.? Sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches.Burned her quite badly, I believe. Little beggars, eh? But keen as mustard!That's a first-rate training they give them in the Spies nowadays--betterthan in my day, even. What d'you think's the latest thing they've servedthem out with? Ear trumpets for listening through keyholes! My littlegirl brought one home the other night--tried it out on our sitting-roomdoor, and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to thehole. Of course it's only a toy, mind you. Still, gives 'em the rightidea, eh?'At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. It was thesignal to return to work. All three men sprang to their feet to join inthe struggle round the lifts, and the remaining tobacco fell out ofWinston's cigarette.Chapter 6Winston was writing in his diary:   It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a narrowside-street near one of the big railway stations. She was standing near adoorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light. Shehad a young face, painted very thick. It was really the paint that appealedto me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. Partywomen never paint their faces. There was nobody else in the street, and notelescreens. She said two dollars. I----For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his eyes and pressedhis fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that keptrecurring. He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string offilthy words at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall,to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window--to do anyviolent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that wastormenting him.Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. At any momentthe tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visiblesymptom. He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeksback; a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five toforty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. They were a few metresapart when the left side of the man's face was suddenly contorted by a sortof spasm. It happened again just as they were passing one another: it wasonly a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, butobviously habitual. He remembered thinking at the time: That poor devil isdone for. And what was frightening was that the action was quite possiblyunconscious. The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. Therewas no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.He drew his breath and went on writing:   I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into abasement kitchen. There was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on thetable, turned down very low. She----His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit. Simultaneouslywith the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine, his wife.Winston was married--had been married, at any rate: probably he still wasmarried, so far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to breatheagain the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compoundedof bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but neverthelessalluring, because no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could beimagined as doing so. Only the proles used scent. In his mind the smellof it was inextricably mixed up with fornication.When he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two yearsor thereabouts. Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, butit was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself tobreak. It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To becaught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour camp:not more, if you had committed no other offence. And it was easy enough,provided that you could avoid being caught in the act. The poorer quartersswarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves. Some could even bepurchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink.Tacitly the Party was even inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outletfor instincts which could not be altogether suppressed. Mere debaucherydid not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless and onlyinvolved the women of a submerged and despised class. The unforgivablecrime was promiscuity between Party members. But--though this was oneof the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessedto--it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening.The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from formingloyalties which it might not be able to control. Its real, undeclaredpurpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. Not love so muchas eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. Allmarriages between Party members had to be approved by a committeeappointed for the purpose, and--though the principle was never clearlystated--permission was always refused if the couple concerned gavethe impression of being physically attracted to one another. The onlyrecognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service ofthe Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgustingminor operation, like having an enema. This again was never put into plainwords, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member fromchildhood onwards. There were even organizations such as the JuniorAnti-Sex League, which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes. Allchildren were to be begotten by artificial insemination (ARTSEM, it wascalled in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. This, Winstonwas aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted inwith the general ideology of the Party. The Party was trying to kill thesex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirtyit. He did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it shouldbe so. And as far as the women were concerned, the Party's efforts werelargely successful.He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten--nearly eleven yearssince they had parted. It was curious how seldom he thought of her. Fordays at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married.They had only been together for about fifteen months. The Party did notpermit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where therewere no children.Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendidmovements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have callednoble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothingbehind it. Very early in her married life he had decided--though perhapsit was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people--thatshe had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he hadever encountered. She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan,and there was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable ofswallowing if the Party handed it out to her. 'The human sound-track' henicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he could have endured living with herif it had not been for just one thing--sex.As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. To embrace herwas like embracing a jointed wooden image. And what was strange was thateven when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that shewas simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidityof her muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie therewith shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but SUBMITTING. It wasextraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even thenhe could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they shouldremain celibate. But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this.They must, she said, produce a child if they could. So the performancecontinued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was notimpossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morning, as somethingwhich had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. She hadtwo names for it. One was 'making a baby', and the other was 'our duty tothe Party' (yes, she had actually used that phrase). Quite soon he grew tohave a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round. Butluckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying,and soon afterwards they parted.Winston sighed inaudibly. He picked up his pen again andwrote:   She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind ofpreliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled upher skirt. I----He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of bugsand cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of defeat andresentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought ofKatharine's white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party.Why did it always have to be like this? Why could he not have a woman ofhis own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years? But a reallove affair was an almost unthinkable event. The women of the Party wereall alike. Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty. Bycareful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish thatwas dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the Youth League, bylectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feelinghad been driven out of them. His reason told him that there must beexceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable,as the Party intended that they should be. And what he wanted, more eventhan to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it wereonly once in his whole life. The sexual act, successfully performed, wasrebellion. Desire was thoughtcrime. Even to have awakened Katharine, if hecould have achieved it, would have been like a seduction, although she washis wife.But the rest of the story had got to be written down. He wrote:   I turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light----After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed verybright. For the first time he could see the woman properly. He had taken astep towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror. He was painfullyconscious of the risk he had taken in coming here. It was perfectlypossible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for that matterthey might be waiting outside the door at this moment. If he went awaywithout even doing what he had come here to do----!It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed. What he hadsuddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was OLD. The paint wasplastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might cracklike a cardboard mask. There were streaks of white in her hair; but thetruly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open,revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness. She had no teeth at all.He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:   When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years oldat least. But I went ahead and did it just the same.He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. He had written it downat last, but it made no difference. The therapy had not worked. The urgeto shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever.Chapter 7'If there is hope,' wrote Winston, 'it lies in the proles.'If there was hope, it MUST lie in the proles, because only there in thoseswarming disregarded masses, 85 per cent of the population of Oceania,could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated. The Party couldnot be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, hadno way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even ifthe legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it wasinconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers thantwos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of thevoice, at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, if onlythey could somehow become conscious of their own strength. would have noneed to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves likea horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party topieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them todo it? And yet----!He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when atremendous shout of hundreds of voices women's voices--had burst from aside-street a little way ahead. It was a great formidable cry of angerand despair, a deep, loud 'Oh-o-o-o-oh!' that went humming on like thereverberation of a bell. His heart had leapt. It's started! he had thought.A riot! The proles are breaking loose at last! When he had reached the spotit was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stallsof a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomedpassengers on a sinking ship. But at this moment the general despair brokedown into a multitude of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of thestalls had been selling tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsy things,but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get. Now the supplyhad unexpectedly given out. The successful women, bumped and jostled bythe rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens ofothers clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper of favouritismand of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve. There was a freshoutburst of yells. Two bloated women, one of them with her hair comingdown, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out ofone another's hands. For a moment they were both tugging, and then thehandle came off. Winston watched them disgustedly. And yet, just for amoment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from onlya few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like thatabout anything that mattered?He wrote:   Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after theyhave rebelled they cannot become conscious.That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription from one of theParty textbooks. The Party claimed, of course, to have liberated the prolesfrom bondage. Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed bythe capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forcedto work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as amatter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the ageof six. But simultaneously, true to the Principles of doublethink, theParty taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept insubjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules. Inreality very little was known about the proles. It was not necessary toknow much. So long as they continued to work and breed, their otheractivities were without importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turnedloose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of lifethat appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They wereborn, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passedthrough a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they marriedat twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part,at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, pettyquarrels with neighbours, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling,filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was notdifficult. A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among them,spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the fewindividuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attemptwas made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party. It was notdesirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All thatwas required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed towhenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours orshorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimesdid, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas,they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evilsinvariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles did not evenhave telescreens in their homes. Even the civil police interfered with themvery little. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a wholeworld-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, andracketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the prolesthemselves, it was of no importance. In all questions of morals they wereallowed to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism of theParty was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity went unpunished, divorcewas permitted. For that matter, even religious worship would have beenpermitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it.They were beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: 'Proles andanimals are free.'Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer. Ithad begun itching again. The thing you invariably came back to was theimpossibility of knowing what life before the Revolution had really beenlike. He took out of the drawer a copy of a children's history textbookwhich he had borrowed from Mrs Parsons, and began copying a passage intothe diary:   In the old days (it ran), before the glorious Revolution, London wasnot the beautiful city that we know today. It was a dark, dirty, miserableplace where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds andthousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof tosleep under. Children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day forcruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly andfed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water. But in among allthis terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful housesthat were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to lookafter them. These rich men were called capitalists. They were fat, uglymen with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page.You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called afrock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which wascalled a top hat. This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one elsewas allowed to wear it. The capitalists owned everything in the world, andeveryone else was their slave. They owned all the land, all the houses,all the factories, and all the money. If anyone disobeyed them they couldthrow them into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him todeath. When any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe andbow to him, and take off his cap and address him as 'Sir'. The chief ofall the capitalists was called the King, and----But he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would be mention of thebishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in their ermine robes, thepillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the cat-o'-nine tails, the Lord Mayor'sBanquet, and the practice of kissing the Pope's toe. There was alsosomething called the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, which would probably not bementioned in a textbook for children. It was the law by which everycapitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of hisfactories.How could you tell how much of it was lies? It MIGHT be true that theaverage human being was better off now than he had been before theRevolution. The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in yourown bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in wereintolerable and that at some other time they must have been different. Itstruck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was notits cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, itslistlessness. Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not onlyto the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the idealsthat the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even for a Partymember, were neutral and non-political, a matter of slogging through drearyjobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadginga saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by theParty was something huge, terrible, and glittering--a world of steeland concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons--a nation ofwarriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking thesame thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting,triumphing, persecuting--three hundred million people all with the sameface. The reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffledto and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses thatsmelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision ofLondon, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with itwas a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair,fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe.He reached down and scratched his ankle again. Day and night thetelescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people todayhad more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations--that theylived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger,happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty yearsago. Not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved. The Party claimed,for example, that today 40 per cent of adult proles were literate: beforethe Revolution, it was said, the number had only been 15 per cent. TheParty claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 perthousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been 300--and so it wenton. It was like a single equation with two unknowns. It might very well bethat literally every word in the history books, even the things that oneaccepted without question, was pure fantasy. For all he knew there mightnever have been any such law as the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, or any such creatureas a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat.Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten,the lie became truth. Just once in his life he had possessed--AFTER theevent: that was what counted--concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act offalsification. He had held it between his fingers for as long as thirtyseconds. In 1973, it must have been--at any rate, it was at about the timewhen he and Katharine had parted. But the really relevant date was sevenor eight years earlier.The story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the greatpurges in which the original leaders of the Revolution were wiped outonce and for all. By 1970 none of them was left, except Big Brotherhimself. All the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors andcounter-revolutionaries. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knewwhere, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majorityhad been executed after spectacular public trials at which they madeconfession of their crimes. Among the last survivors were three men namedJones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. It must have been in 1965 that these threehad been arrested. As often happened, they had vanished for a year or more,so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then hadsuddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way.They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, theenemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of varioustrusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brotherwhich had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotagecausing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. After confessing tothese things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the Party, and givenposts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important. All threehad written long, abject articles in 'The Times', analysing the reasonsfor their defection and promising to make amends.Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of themin the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He remembered the sort of terrified fascinationwith which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. They were menfar older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last greatfigures left over from the heroic days of the Party. The glamour of theunderground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. He hadthe feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growingblurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known thatof Big Brother. But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomedwith absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. No one who hadonce fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end.They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It was not wiseeven to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. They were sittingin silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was thespeciality of the cafe. Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearancehad most impressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist,whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before andduring the Revolution. Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons wereappearing in The Times. They were simply an imitation of his earliermanner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were arehashing of the ancient themes--slum tenements, starving children, streetbattles, capitalists in top hats--even on the barricades the capitalistsstill seemed to cling to their top hats an endless, hopeless effort toget back into the past. He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasygrey hair, his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At onetime he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging,sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction. He seemed to be breakingup before one's eyes, like a mountain crumbling.It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not now remember how hehad come to be in the cafe at such a time. The place was almost empty. Atinny music was trickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in theircorner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded, the waiter broughtfresh glasses of gin. There was a chessboard on the table beside them, withthe pieces set out but no game started. And then, for perhaps half a minutein all, something happened to the telescreens. The tune that they wereplaying changed, and the tone of the music changed too. There came intoit--but it was something hard to describe. It was a peculiar, cracked,braying, jeering note: in his mind Winston called it a yellow note. Andthen a voice from the telescreen was singing:  Under the spreading chestnut tree  I sold you and you sold me:  There lie they, and here lie we  Under the spreading chestnut tree.The three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced again at Rutherford'sruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. And for the firsttime he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowingAT WHAT he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared that they hadengaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release. Attheir second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, witha whole string of new ones. They were executed, and their fate was recordedin the Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years afterthis, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had justflopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragmentof paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and thenforgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance.It was a half-page torn out of 'The Times' of about ten years earlier--thetop half of the page, so that it included the date--and it contained aphotograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York. Prominentin the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There wasno mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at thebottom.The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on thatdate they had been on Eurasian soil. They had flown from a secret airfieldin Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred withmembers of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed importantmilitary secrets. The date had stuck in Winston's memory because it chancedto be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countlessother places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: theconfessions were lies.Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that time Winstonhad not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges hadactually committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this wasconcrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossilbone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory.It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could havebeen published to the world and its significance made known.He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what the photographwas, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper.Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point ofview of the telescreen.He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so asto get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your faceexpressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could becontrolled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of yourheart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He letwhat he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by thefear that some accident--a sudden draught blowing across his desk, forinstance--would betray him. Then, without uncovering it again, he droppedthe photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers.Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.That was ten--eleven years ago. Today, probably, he would have kept thatphotograph. It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingersseemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself,as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party's holdupon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence whichexisted no longer HAD ONCE existed?But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes,the photograph might not even be evidence. Already, at the time when hemade his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it musthave been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayedtheir country. Since then there had been other changes--two, three,he could not remember how many. Very likely the confessions had beenrewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longerhad the smallest significance. The past not only changed, but changedcontinuously. What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was thathe had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken.The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but theultimate motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote:   I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself wasa lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. At one time ithad been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun;today, to believe that the past is unalterable. He might be ALONE inholding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of beinga lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might alsobe wrong.He picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait ofBig Brother which formed its frontispiece. The hypnotic eyes gazed intohis own. It was as though some huge force were pressing down uponyou--something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against yourbrain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, todeny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce thattwo and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitablethat they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of theirposition demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the veryexistence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. Theheresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not thatthey would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right.For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that theforce of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the pastand the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself iscontrollable what then?But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord. The faceof O'Brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into hismind. He knew, with more certainty than before, that O'Brien was on hisside. He was writing the diary for O'Brien--TO O'Brien: it was like aninterminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressedto a particular person and took its colour from that fact.The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It wastheir final, most essential command. His heart sank as he thought ofthe enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Partyintellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which hewould not be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he was in theright! They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly, and thetrue had got to be defended. Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solidworld exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet,objects unsupported fall towards the earth's centre. With the feeling thathe was speaking to O'Brien, and also that he was setting forth an importantaxiom, he wrote:   Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that isgranted, all else follows.Chapter 8From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roastingcoffee--real coffee, not Victory Coffee--came floating out into the street.Winston paused involuntarily. For perhaps two seconds he was back in thehalf-forgotten world of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cutoff the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound.He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcerwas throbbing. This was the second time in three weeks that he had missedan evening at the Community Centre: a rash act, since you could be certainthat the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked.In principle a Party member had no spare time, and was never alone exceptin bed. It was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleepinghe would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do anythingthat suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself,was always slightly dangerous. There was a word for it in Newspeak:OWNLIFE, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. But thisevening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air hadtempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, andsuddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre, the boring, exhaustinggames, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemedintolerable. On impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wanderedoff into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, then north again,losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in whichdirection he was going.'If there is hope,' he had written in the diary, 'it lies in the proles.'The words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and apalpable absurdity. He was somewhere in the vague, brown-coloured slumsto the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He waswalking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with battereddoorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehowcuriously suggestive of ratholes. There were puddles of filthy water hereand there among the cobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and downnarrow alley-ways that branched off on either side, people swarmed inastonishing numbers--girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths,and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed youwhat the girls would be like in ten years' time, and old bent creaturesshuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who playedin the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers.Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up.Most of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with asort of guarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-red forearmsfolded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway. Winston caughtscraps of conversation as he approached.'"Yes," I says to 'er, "that's all very well," I says. "But if you'd ofbeen in my place you'd of done the same as what I done. It's easy tocriticize," I says, "but you ain't got the same problems as what I got."''Ah,' said the other, 'that's jest it. That's jest where it is.'The strident voices stopped abruptly. The women studied him in hostilesilence as he went past. But it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kindof wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliaranimal. The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in astreet like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unlessyou had definite business there. The patrols might stop you if you happenedto run into them. 'May I see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here?What time did you leave work? Is this your usual way home?'--and so on andso forth. Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusualroute: but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Policeheard about it.Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were yells of warningfrom all sides. People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. Ayoung woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up atiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt backagain, all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-likeblack suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston,pointing excitedly to the sky.'Steamer!' he yelled. 'Look out, guv'nor! Bang over'ead! Lay down quick!''Steamer' was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied torocket bombs. Winston promptly flung himself on his face. The proles werenearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemedto possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advancewhen a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled fasterthan sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roarthat seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects patteredon to his back. When he stood up he found that he was covered withfragments of glass from the nearest window.He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up thestreet. A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud ofplaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins. Therewas a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and inthe middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it hesaw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from the bloodystump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turneddown a side-street to the right. Within three or four minutes he was outof the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life ofthe streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearlytwenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ('pubs',they called them) were choked with customers. From their grimy swing doors,endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust,and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting house-front three menwere standing very close together, the middle one of them holding afolded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder.Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces,Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. It wasobviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. He was a fewpaces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the menwere in violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on the pointof blows.'Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you no number endingin seven ain't won for over fourteen months!''Yes, it 'as, then!''No, it 'as not! Back 'ome I got the 'ole lot of 'em for over two yearswrote down on a piece of paper. I takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock. An'I tell you, no number ending in seven----''Yes, a seven 'AS won! I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number.Four oh seven, it ended in. It were in February--second week in February.''February your grandmother! I got it all down in black and white. An' Itell you, no number----''Oh, pack it in!' said the third man.They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back when he had gonethirty metres. They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one publicevent to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable thatthere were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principalif not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, theirfolly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery wasconcerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable ofintricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a wholetribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, andlucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery,which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeedeveryone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary.Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes beingnon-existent persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication betweenone part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that.When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked atthe human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act offaith. The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feelingthat he had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a mainthoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din ofshouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flightof steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stall-keeperswere selling tired-looking vegetables. At this moment Winston rememberedwhere he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down the nextturning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop where he had bought theblank book which was now his diary. And in a small stationer's shop notfar away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the opposite side ofthe alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frostedover but in reality were merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent butactive, with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn,pushed open the swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching, itoccurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, hadalready been middle-aged when the Revolution happened. He and a few otherslike him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world ofcapitalism. In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideashad been formed before the Revolution. The older generation had mostlybeen wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the fewwho survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectualsurrender. If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthfulaccount of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be aprole. Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied intohis diary came back into Winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took holdof him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with thatold man and question him. He would say to him: 'Tell me about your lifewhen you were a boy. What was it like in those days? Were things betterthan they are now, or were they worse?'Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended thesteps and crossed the narrow street. It was madness of course. As usual,there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting theirpubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If thepatrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was notlikely that they would believe him. He pushed open the door, and a hideouscheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. As he entered the din ofvoices dropped to about half its volume. Behind his back he could feeleveryone eyeing his blue overalls. A game of darts which was going on atthe other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirtyseconds. The old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar, havingsome kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed youngman with enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing round with glassesin their hands, were watching the scene.'I arst you civil enough, didn't I?' said the old man, straightening hisshoulders pugnaciously. 'You telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the'ole bleeding boozer?''And what in hell's name IS a pint?' said the barman, leaning forward withthe tips of his fingers on the counter.''Ark at 'im! Calls 'isself a barman and don't know what a pint is! Why,a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and there's four quarts to the gallon.'Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.''Never heard of 'em,' said the barman shortly. 'Litre and halflitre--that's all we serve. There's the glasses on the shelf in frontof you.''I likes a pint,' persisted the old man. 'You could 'a drawed me off a pinteasy enough. We didn't 'ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man.''When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,' said thebarman, with a glance at the other customers.There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston's entryseemed to disappear. The old man's white-stubbled face had flushed pink. Heturned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caughthim gently by the arm.'May I offer you a drink?' he said.'You're a gent,' said the other, straightening his shoulders again. Heappeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls. 'Pint!' he addedaggressively to the barman. 'Pint of wallop.'The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into thick glasseswhich he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. Beer was the only drinkyou could get in prole pubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin,though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game ofdarts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had beguntalking about lottery tickets. Winston's presence was forgotten for amoment. There was a deal table under the window where he and the old mancould talk without fear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, butat any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sureof as soon as he came in.''E could 'a drawed me off a pint,' grumbled the old man as he settled downbehind a glass. 'A 'alf litre ain't enough. It don't satisfy. And a 'olelitre's too much. It starts my bladder running. Let alone the price.''You must have seen great changes since you were a young man,' saidWinston tentatively.The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, andfrom the bar to the door of the Gents, as though it were in the bar-roomthat he expected the changes to have occurred.'The beer was better,' he said finally. 'And cheaper! When I was a youngman, mild beer--wallop we used to call it--was fourpence a pint. That wasbefore the war, of course.''Which war was that?' said Winston.'It's all wars,' said the old man vaguely. He took up his glass, and hisshoulders straightened again. ''Ere's wishing you the very best of 'ealth!'In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam's apple made a surprisingly rapidup-and-down movement, and the beer vanished. Winston went to the bar andcame back with two more half-litres. The old man appeared to have forgottenhis prejudice against drinking a full litre.'You are very much older than I am,' said Winston. 'You must have been agrown man before I was born. You can remember what it was like in the olddays, before the Revolution. People of my age don't really know anythingabout those times. We can only read about them in books, and what it saysin the books may not be true. I should like your opinion on that. Thehistory books say that life before the Revolution was completely differentfrom what it is now. There was the most terrible oppression, injustice,poverty worse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, the great massof the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. Half of themhadn't even boots on their feet. They worked twelve hours a day, they leftschool at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same time there werea very few people, only a few thousands--the capitalists, they werecalled--who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there wasto own. They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, theyrode about in motor-cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne,they wore top hats----'The old man brightened suddenly.'Top 'ats!' he said. 'Funny you should mention 'em. The same thing comeinto my 'ead only yesterday, I dono why. I was jest thinking, I ain't seena top 'at in years. Gorn right out, they 'ave. The last time I wore onewas at my sister-in-law's funeral. And that was--well, I couldn't give youthe date, but it must'a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only 'iredfor the occasion, you understand.''It isn't very important about the top hats,' said Winston patiently.'The point is, these capitalists--they and a few lawyers and priests andso forth who lived on them--were the lords of the earth. Everything existedfor their benefit. You--the ordinary people, the workers--were theirslaves. They could do what they liked with you. They could ship you off toCanada like cattle. They could sleep with your daughters if they chose.They could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o'-ninetails. You had to take your cap off when you passed them. Every capitalistwent about with a gang of lackeys who----'The old man brightened again.'Lackeys!' he said. 'Now there's a word I ain't 'eard since ever so long.Lackeys! That reg'lar takes me back, that does. I recollect--oh, donkey'syears ago--I used to sometimes go to 'Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to'ear the blokes making speeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews,Indians--all sorts there was. And there was one bloke--well, I couldn'tgive you 'is name, but a real powerful speaker 'e was. 'E didn't 'alfgive it 'em! "Lackeys!" 'e says, "lackeys of the bourgeoisie! Flunkies ofthe ruling class!" Parasites--that was another of them. And 'yenas--'edefinitely called 'em 'yenas. Of course 'e was referring to the LabourParty, you understand.'Winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross-purposes.'What I really wanted to know was this,' he said. 'Do you feel that youhave more freedom now than you had in those days? Are you treated morelike a human being? In the old days, the rich people, the people at thetop----''The 'Ouse of Lords,' put in the old man reminiscently.'The House of Lords, if you like. What I am asking is, were these peopleable to treat you as an inferior, simply because they were rich and youwere poor? Is it a fact, for instance, that you had to call them "Sir" andtake off your cap when you passed them?'The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off about a quarter of hisbeer before answering.'Yes,' he said. 'They liked you to touch your cap to 'em. It showedrespect, like. I didn't agree with it, myself, but I done it often enough.Had to, as you might say.''And was it usual--I'm only quoting what I've read in history books--wasit usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavementinto the gutter?''One of 'em pushed me once,' said the old man. 'I recollect it as if itwas yesterday. It was Boat Race night--terribly rowdy they used to get onBoat Race night--and I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue.Quite a gent, 'e was--dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat. 'E was kindof zig-zagging across the pavement, and I bumps into 'im accidental-like.'E says, "Why can't you look where you're going?" 'e says. I say, "Ju thinkyou've bought the bleeding pavement?" 'E says, "I'll twist your bloody 'eadoff if you get fresh with me." I says, "You're drunk. I'll give you incharge in 'alf a minute," I says. An' if you'll believe me, 'e puts 'is'and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under thewheels of a bus. Well, I was young in them days, and I was going to 'avefetched 'im one, only----'A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old man's memory wasnothing but a rubbish-heap of details. One could question him all daywithout getting any real information. The party histories might still betrue, after a fashion: they might even be completely true. He made a lastattempt.'Perhaps I have not made myself clear,' he said. 'What I'm trying to sayis this. You have been alive a very long time; you lived half your lifebefore the Revolution. In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up.Would you say from what you can remember, that life in 1925 was betterthan it is now, or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to livethen or now?'The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He finished up hisbeer, more slowly than before. When he spoke it was with a tolerantphilosophical air, as though the beer had mellowed him.'I know what you expect me to say,' he said. 'You expect me to say as I'dsooner be young again. Most people'd say they'd sooner be young, if youarst 'em. You got your 'ealth and strength when you're young. When youget to my time of life you ain't never well. I suffer something wickedfrom my feet, and my bladder's jest terrible. Six and seven times a nightit 'as me out of bed. On the other 'and, there's great advantages in beinga old man. You ain't got the same worries. No truck with women, and that'sa great thing. I ain't 'ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you'dcredit it. Nor wanted to, what's more.'Winston sat back against the window-sill. It was no use going on. He wasabout to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffledrapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The extrahalf-litre was already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or twogazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him outinto the street again. Within twenty years at the most, he reflected, thehuge and simple question, 'Was life better before the Revolution than itis now?' would have ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effectit was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from theancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. Theyremembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt fora lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister's face, theswirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevantfacts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant,which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed andwritten records were falsified--when that happened, the claim of the Partyto have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted,because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standardagainst which it could be tested.At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He halted and lookedup. He was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersedamong dwelling-houses. Immediately above his head there hung threediscoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. Heseemed to know the place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk-shopwhere he had bought the diary.A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a sufficiently rash act tobuy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near theplace again. And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander,his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. It was preciselyagainst suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himselfby opening the diary. At the same time he noticed that although it wasnearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open. With the feeling that hewould be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement, hestepped through the doorway. If questioned, he could plausibly say thathe was trying to buy razor blades.The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off anunclean but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps sixty, frail andbowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thickspectacles. His hair was almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy andstill black. His spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the factthat he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague airof intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary man, orperhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as though faded, and his accentless debased than that of the majority of proles.'I recognized you on the pavement,' he said immediately. 'You're thegentleman that bought the young lady's keepsake album. That was a beautifulbit of paper, that was. Cream-laid, it used to be called. There's been nopaper like that made for--oh, I dare say fifty years.' He peered at Winstonover the top of his spectacles. 'Is there anything special I can do foryou? Or did you just want to look round?''I was passing,' said Winston vaguely. 'I just looked in. I don't wantanything in particular.''It's just as well,' said the other, 'because I don't suppose I could havesatisfied you.' He made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand.'You see how it is; an empty shop, you might say. Between you and me, theantique trade's just about finished. No demand any longer, and no stockeither. Furniture, china, glass it's all been broken up by degrees. Andof course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down. I haven't seen a brasscandlestick in years.'The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but therewas almost nothing in it of the slightest value. The floorspace was veryrestricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dustypicture-frames. In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-outchisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not evenpretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish. Only on asmall table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends--lacqueredsnuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like--which looked as though they mightinclude something interesting. As Winston wandered towards the table hiseye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in thelamplight, and he picked it up.It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, makingalmost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater, inboth the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnifiedby the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object thatrecalled a rose or a sea anemone.'What is it?' said Winston, fascinated.'That's coral, that is,' said the old man. 'It must have come from theIndian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in the glass. That wasn't madeless than a hundred years ago. More, by the look of it.''It's a beautiful thing,' said Winston.'It is a beautiful thing,' said the other appreciatively. 'But there's notmany that'd say so nowadays.' He coughed. 'Now, if it so happened that youwanted to buy it, that'd cost you four dollars. I can remember when a thinglike that would have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was--well, Ican't work it out, but it was a lot of money. But who cares about genuineantiques nowadays--even the few that's left?'Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thinginto his pocket. What appealed to him about it was not so much its beautyas the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite differentfrom the present one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glassthat he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of itsapparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have beenintended as a paperweight. It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunatelyit did not make much of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromisingthing, for a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old, and forthat matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The old man hadgrown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. Winstonrealized that he would have accepted three or even two.'There's another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,' hesaid. 'There's not much in it. Just a few pieces. We'll do with a light ifwe're going upstairs.'He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up thesteep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which didnot give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest ofchimney-pots. Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged asthough the room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet onthe floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly arm-chairdrawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hourface was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupyingnearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress stillon it.'We lived here till my wife died,' said the old man half apologetically.'I'm selling the furniture off by little and little. Now that's a beautifulmahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it.But I dare say you'd find it a little bit cumbersome.'He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, andin the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. The thoughtflitted through Winston's mind that it would probably be quite easy torent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. Itwas a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; butthe room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestralmemory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit ina room like this, in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your feet inthe fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, withnobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singingof the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.'There's no telescreen!' he could not help murmuring.'Ah,' said the old man, 'I never had one of those things. Too expensive.And I never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow. Now that's a nicegateleg table in the corner there. Though of course you'd have to put newhinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps.'There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and Winston had alreadygravitated towards it. It contained nothing but rubbish. The hunting-downand destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in theprole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that there existedanywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960. The oldman, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in arosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, oppositethe bed.'Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all----' he begandelicately.Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel engraving of anoval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. Therewas a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there waswhat appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. Itseemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.'The frame's fixed to the wall,' said the old man, 'but I could unscrew itfor you, I dare say.''I know that building,' said Winston finally. 'It's a ruin now. It's inthe middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice.''That's right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in--oh, many yearsago. It was a church at one time, St Clement Danes, its name was.' Hesmiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightlyridiculous, and added: 'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!''What's that?' said Winston.'Oh--"Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's." That was a rhymewe had when I was a little boy. How it goes on I don't remember, but I doknow it ended up, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes achopper to chop off your head." It was a kind of a dance. They held outtheir arms for you to pass under, and when they came to "Here comes achopper to chop off your head" they brought their arms down and caught you.It was just names of churches. All the London churches were in it--all theprincipal ones, that is.'Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. It was alwaysdifficult to determine the age of a London building. Anything large andimpressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automaticallyclaimed as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that wasobviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the MiddleAges. The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of anyvalue. One could not learn history from architecture any more than onecould learn it from books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, thenames of streets--anything that might throw light upon the past had beensystematically altered.'I never knew it had been a church,' he said.'There's a lot of them left, really,' said the old man, 'though they'vebeen put to other uses. Now, how did that rhyme go? Ah! I've got it!  "Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,  You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's----"there, now, that's as far as I can get. A farthing, that was a small coppercoin, looked something like a cent.''Where was St Martin's?' said Winston.'St Martin's? That's still standing. It's in Victory Square, alongside thepicture gallery. A building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillarsin front, and a big flight of steps.'Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used for propaganda displaysof various kinds--scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses,waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.'St Martin's-in-the-Fields it used to be called,' supplemented the old man,'though I don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.'Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an even moreincongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carryhome, unless it were taken out of its frame. But he lingered for someminutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was notWeeks--as one might have gathered from the inscription over theshop-front--but Charrington. Mr Charrington, it seemed, was a widower agedsixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years. Throughout thattime he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had neverquite got to the point of doing it. All the while that they were talkingthe half-remembered rhyme kept running through Winston's head. Oranges andlemons say the bells of St Clement's, You owe me three farthings, saythe bells of St Martin's! It was curious, but when you said it to yourselfyou had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost Londonthat still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From oneghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet sofar as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bellsringing.He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as notto let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out ofthe door. He had already made up his mind that after a suitableinterval--a month, say--he would take the risk of visiting the shop again.It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre.The serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place,after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of theshop could be trusted. However----!Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would buy further scraps ofbeautiful rubbish. He would buy the engraving of St Clement Danes, takeit out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of hisoveralls. He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington'smemory. Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashedmomentarily through his mind again. For perhaps five seconds exaltationmade him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without so muchas a preliminary glance through the window. He had even started hummingto an improvised tune  Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,  You owe me three farthings, say the----Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water. A figurein blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten metres away. It wasthe girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The lightwas failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She lookedhim straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had notseen him.For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move. Then he turned to theright and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he wasgoing in the wrong direction. At any rate, one question was settled. Therewas no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She must havefollowed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance sheshould have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscurebackstreet, kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived.It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was really an agent of theThought Police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardlymattered. It was enough that she was watching him. Probably she had seenhim go into the pub as well.It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocket banged againsthis thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw itaway. The worst thing was the pain in his belly. For a couple of minuteshe had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon.But there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then thespasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.The street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood for several secondswondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace hissteps. As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed himthree minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her.He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and thensmash her skull in with a cobblestone. The piece of glass in his pocketwould be heavy enough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately,because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. Hecould not run, he could not strike a blow. Besides, she was young and lustyand would defend herself. He thought also of hurrying to the CommunityCentre and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish apartial alibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadlylassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get home quickly andthen sit down and be quiet.It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat. The lightswould be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty. He went into thekitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went tothe table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer.But he did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy female voicewas squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring at the marbled cover of thebook, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness.It was at night that they came for you, always at night. The proper thingwas to kill yourself before they got you. Undoubtedly some people did so.Many of the disappearances were actually suicides. But it needed desperatecourage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick andcertain poison, were completely unprocurable. He thought with a kind ofastonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treacheryof the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the momentwhen a special effort is needed. He might have silenced the dark-hairedgirl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely because of theextremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. It struck him thatin moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, butalways against one's own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dullache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And it is the same,he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. On thebattlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues thatyou are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up untilit fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright orscreaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger orcold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.He opened the diary. It was important to write something down. The womanon the telescreen had started a new song. Her voice seemed to stick intohis brain like jagged splinters of glass. He tried to think of O'Brien,for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinkingof the things that would happen to him after the Thought Police took himaway. It would not matter if they killed you at once. To be killed waswhat you expected. But before death (nobody spoke of such things, yeteverybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had tobe gone through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy, thecrack of broken bones, the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hair.Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? Why wasit not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? Nobody everescaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you hadsuccumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would bedead. Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embeddedin future time?He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image ofO'Brien. 'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' O'Brienhad said to him. He knew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place wherethere is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see,but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. But with thevoice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the trainof thought further. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobaccopromptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult tospit out again. The face of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing thatof O'Brien. Just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out ofhis pocket and looked at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm,protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?Like a leaden knell the words came back at him:  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHPART TWOChapter 1It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left the cubicle to goto the lavatory.A solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long,brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl with dark hair. Four days had gonepast since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk-shop.As she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeableat a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls. Probablyshe had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopeson which the plots of novels were 'roughed in'. It was a common accidentin the Fiction Department.They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almostflat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her. She must havefallen right on the injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risento her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which hermouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with anappealing expression that looked more like fear than pain.A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart. In front of him was an enemywho was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature,in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. Already he had instinctivelystarted forward to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall onthe bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body.'You're hurt?' he said.'It's nothing. My arm. It'll be all right in a second.'She spoke as though her heart were fluttering. She had certainly turnedvery pale.'You haven't broken anything?''No, I'm all right. It hurt for a moment, that's all.'She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up. She had regainedsome of her colour, and appeared very much better.'It's nothing,' she repeated shortly. 'I only gave my wrist a bit of abang. Thanks, comrade!'And with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going,as briskly as though it had really been nothing. The whole incident couldnot have taken as much as half a minute. Not to let one's feelings appearin one's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct,and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreenwhen the thing happened. Nevertheless it had been very difficult not tobetray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he washelping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. There was noquestion that she had done it intentionally. It was something small andflat. As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to hispocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. It was a scrap of paperfolded into a square.While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more fingering, toget it unfolded. Obviously there must be a message of some kind written onit. For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closetsand read it at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew.There was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreenswere watched continuously.He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment of papercasually among the other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles andhitched the speakwrite towards him. 'Five minutes,' he told himself,'five minutes at the very least!' His heart bumped in his breast withfrightening loudness. Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on wasmere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needingclose attention.Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind of politicalmeaning. So far as he could see there were two possibilities. One, muchthe more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police,just as he had feared. He did not know why the Thought Police shouldchoose to deliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they hadtheir reasons. The thing that was written on the paper might be a threat, asummons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some description. But therewas another, wilder possibility that kept raising its head, though hetried vainly to suppress it. This was, that the message did not come fromthe Thought Police at all, but from some kind of underground organization.Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps the girl was part of it!No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the veryinstant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not till a coupleof minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred tohim. And even now, though his intellect told him that the message probablymeant death--still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonablehope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty that hekept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into thespeakwrite.He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatictube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose,sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the scrap ofpaper on top of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a largeunformed handwriting:I LOVE YOU.For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminatingthing into the memory hole. When he did so, although he knew very well thedanger of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it onceagain, just to make sure that the words were really there.For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. What was evenworse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was theneed to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. He felt as though afire were burning in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filledcanteen was torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little while duringthe lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile Parsons floppeddown beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell ofstew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week.He was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of BigBrother's head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion byhis daughter's troop of Spies. The irritating thing was that in the racketof voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying, and wasconstantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just oncehe caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at thefar end of the room. She appeared not to have seen him, and he did notlook in that direction again.The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after lunch there arrived adelicate, difficult piece of work which would take several hours andnecessitated putting everything else aside. It consisted in falsifying aseries of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to castdiscredit on a prominent member of the Inner Party, who was now under acloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and for morethan two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mindaltogether. Then the memory of her face came back, and with it a raging,intolerable desire to be alone. Until he could be alone it was impossibleto think this new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at theCommunity Centre. He wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurriedoff to the Centre, took part in the solemn foolery of a 'discussion group',played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, andsat for half an hour through a lecture entitled 'Ingsoc in relation tochess'. His soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulseto shirk his evening at the Centre. At the sight of the words I LOVE YOUthe desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minorrisks suddenly seemed stupid. It was not till twenty-three hours, when hewas home and in bed--in the darkness, where you were safe even from thetelescreen so long as you kept silent--that he was able to thinkcontinuously.It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch withthe girl and arrange a meeting. He did not consider any longer thepossibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. He knewthat it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handedhim the note. Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as wellshe might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross hismind. Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in witha cobblestone, but that was of no importance. He thought of her naked,youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined her a foollike all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, herbelly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he mightlose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him! What he fearedmore than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if hedid not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical difficulty ofmeeting was enormous. It was like trying to make a move at chess when youwere already mated. Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you.Actually, all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred tohim within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with time to think,he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row of instrumentson a table.Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could notbe repeated. If she had worked in the Records Department it might havebeen comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts inthe building the Fiction Department lay, and he had no pretext for goingthere. If he had known where she lived, and at what time she left work,he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to tryto follow her home was not safe, because it would mean loitering aboutoutside the Ministry, which was bound to be noticed. As for sending aletter through the mails, it was out of the question. By a routine thatwas not even secret, all letters were opened in transit. Actually, fewpeople ever wrote letters. For the messages that it was occasionallynecessary to send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases,and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he did notknow the girl's name, let alone her address. Finally he decided that thesafest place was the canteen. If he could get her at a table by herself,somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, andwith a sufficient buzz of conversation all round--if these conditionsendured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a fewwords.For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On the next day shedid not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the whistle havingalready blown. Presumably she had been changed on to a later shift. Theypassed each other without a glance. On the day after that she was in thecanteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediatelyunder a telescreen. Then for three dreadful days she did not appear atall. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearablesensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, everysound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, anagony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image. He didnot touch the diary during those days. If there was any relief, it was inhis work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at astretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. Therewas no enquiry he could make. She might have been vaporized, she mighthave committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other endof Oceania: worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed hermind and decided to avoid him.The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling and she had aband of sticking-plaster round her wrist. The relief of seeing her wasso great that he could not resist staring directly at her for severalseconds. On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her.When he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from thewall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was not very full.The queue edged forward till Winston was almost at the counter, then washeld up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that hehad not received his tablet of saccharine. But the girl was still alonewhen Winston secured his tray and began to make for her table. He walkedcasually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyondher. She was perhaps three metres away from him. Another two seconds woulddo it. Then a voice behind him called, 'Smith!' He pretended not to hear.'Smith!' repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use. He turned round.A blond-headed, silly-faced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew,was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was notsafe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not go and sit ata table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down witha friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had ahallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it.The girl's table filled up a few minutes later.But she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps she would takethe hint. Next day he took care to arrive early. Surely enough, she was ata table in about the same place, and again alone. The person immediatelyahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like manwith a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away fromthe counter with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straightfor the girl's table. His hopes sank again. There was a vacant place at atable further away, but something in the little man's appearance suggestedthat he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose theemptiest table. With ice at his heart Winston followed. It was no useunless he could get the girl alone. At this moment there was a tremendouscrash. The little man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying,two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. He startedto his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, whom he evidentlysuspected of having tripped him up. But it was all right. Five secondslater, with a thundering heart, Winston was sitting at the girl's table.He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating.It was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else came, but nowa terrible fear had taken possession of him. A week had gone by sinceshe had first approached him. She would have changed her mind, she musthave changed her mind! It was impossible that this affair should endsuccessfully; such things did not happen in real life. He might haveflinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seenAmpleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round the room witha tray, looking for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforthwas attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at his table ifhe caught sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act. BothWinston and the girl were eating steadily. The stuff they were eating wasa thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winstonbegan speaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned thewatery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the fewnecessary words in low expressionless voices.'What time do you leave work?''Eighteen-thirty.''Where can we meet?''Victory Square, near the monument.''It's full of telescreens.''It doesn't matter if there's a crowd.''Any signal?''No. Don't come up to me until you see me among a lot of people. And don'tlook at me. Just keep somewhere near me.''What time?''Nineteen hours.''All right.'Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at another table. They didnot speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two people sitting onopposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one another. Thegirl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while Winston stayed tosmoke a cigarette.Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time. He wandered roundthe base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which Big Brother'sstatue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished theEurasian aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a few yearsago) in the Battle of Airstrip One. In the street in front of it there wasa statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent OliverCromwell. At five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared.Again the terrible fear seized upon Winston. She was not coming, she hadchanged her mind! He walked slowly up to the north side of the square andgot a sort of pale-coloured pleasure from identifying St Martin's Church,whose bells, when it had bells, had chimed 'You owe me three farthings.'Then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, reading orpretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column. It was notsafe to go near her until some more people had accumulated. There weretelescreens all round the pediment. But at this moment there was a din ofshouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. Suddenlyeveryone seemed to be running across the square. The girl nipped nimblyround the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush.Winston followed. As he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks thata convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing.Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square.Winston, at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outeredge of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forwardinto the heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm's length of the girl,but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormouswoman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall offlesh. Winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managedto drive his shoulder between them. For a moment it felt as though hisentrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips, then hehad broken through, sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They wereshoulder to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed with sub-machineguns standing upright in each corner, was passing slowly down the street.In the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting,jammed close together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out over the sidesof the trucks utterly incurious. Occasionally when a truck jolted therewas a clank-clank of metal: all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons.Truck-load after truck-load of the sad faces passed. Winston knew theywere there but he saw them only intermittently. The girl's shoulder, andher arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Her cheek wasalmost near enough for him to feel its warmth. She had immediately takencharge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. She beganspeaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barelymoving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumblingof the trucks.'Can you hear me?''Yes.''Can you get Sunday afternoon off?''Yes.''Then listen carefully. You'll have to remember this. Go to PaddingtonStation----'With a sort of military precision that astonished him, she outlined theroute that he was to follow. A half-hour railway journey; turn left outsidethe station; two kilometres along the road; a gate with the top barmissing; a path across a field; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes;a dead tree with moss on it. It was as though she had a map inside herhead. 'Can you remember all that?' she murmured finally.'Yes.''You turn left, then right, then left again. And the gate's got no top bar.''Yes. What time?''About fifteen. You may have to wait. I'll get there by another way. Areyou sure you remember everything?''Yes.''Then get away from me as quick as you can.'She need not have told him that. But for the moment they could notextricate themselves from the crowd. The trucks were still filing past,the people still insatiably gaping. At the start there had been a few boosand hisses, but it came only from the Party members among the crowd, andhad soon stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. Foreigners,whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind of strange animal. Oneliterally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners, and even asprisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them. Nor didone know what became of them, apart from the few who were hanged aswar-criminals: the others simply vanished, presumably into forced-labourcamps. The round Mogol faces had given way to faces of a more Europeantype, dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheekbones eyeslooked into Winston's, sometimes with strange intensity, and flashed awayagain. The convoy was drawing to an end. In the last truck he could see anaged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wristscrossed in front of him, as though he were used to having them boundtogether. It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part. But at thelast moment, while the crowd still hemmed them in, her hand felt for hisand gave it a fleeting squeeze.It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time thattheir hands were clasped together. He had time to learn every detailof her hand. He explored the long fingers, the shapely nails, thework-hardened palm with its row of callouses, the smooth flesh under thewrist. Merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight. In thesame instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour thegirl's eyes were. They were probably brown, but people with dark hairsometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head and look at her would havebeen inconceivable folly. With hands locked together, invisible amongthe press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and insteadof the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfullyat Winston out of nests of hair.Chapter 2Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade,stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted. Under thetrees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells. The airseemed to kiss one's skin. It was the second of May. From somewhere deeperin the heart of the wood came the droning of ring-doves.He was a bit early. There had been no difficulties about the journey, andthe girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than hewould normally have been. Presumably she could be trusted to find a safeplace. In general you could not assume that you were much safer in thecountry than in London. There were no telescreens, of course, but therewas always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice mightbe picked up and recognized; besides, it was not easy to make a journeyby yourself without attracting attention. For distances of less than100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed, butsometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations, whoexamined the papers of any Party member they found there and asked awkwardquestions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from thestation he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was notbeing followed. The train was full of proles, in holiday mood because ofthe summery weather. The wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled wasfilled to overflowing by a single enormous family, ranging from a toothlessgreat-grandmother to a month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoonwith 'in-laws' in the country, and, as they freely explained to Winston,to get hold of a little black-market butter.The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told himof, a mere cattle-track which plunged between the bushes. He had no watch,but it could not be fifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfootthat it was impossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and beganpicking some partly to pass the time away, but also from a vague idea thathe would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when theymet. He had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sicklyscent when a sound at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of afoot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was the best thing to do.It might be the girl, or he might have been followed after all. To lookround was to show guilt. He picked another and another. A hand felllightly on his shoulder.He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evidently as a warningthat he must keep silent, then parted the bushes and quickly led the wayalong the narrow track into the wood. Obviously she had been that waybefore, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston followed,still clasping his bunch of flowers. His first feeling was relief, but ashe watched the strong slender body moving in front of him, with the scarletsash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips, thesense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quitelikely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw backafter all. The sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves dauntedhim. Already on the walk from the station the May sunshine had made himfeel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the sooty dust ofLondon in the pores of his skin. It occurred to him that till now she hadprobably never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They came to thefallen tree that she had spoken of. The girl hopped over and forced apartthe bushes, in which there did not seem to be an opening. When Winstonfollowed her, he found that they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassyknoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely. The girlstopped and turned.'Here we are,' she said.He was facing her at several paces' distance. As yet he did not dare movenearer to her.'I didn't want to say anything in the lane,' she went on, 'in case there'sa mike hidden there. I don't suppose there is, but there could be. There'salways the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice. We're allright here.'He still had not the courage to approach her. 'We're all right here?'he repeated stupidly.'Yes. Look at the trees.' They were small ashes, which at some time hadbeen cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles, none ofthem thicker than one's wrist. 'There's nothing big enough to hide a mikein. Besides, I've been here before.'They were only making conversation. He had managed to move closer to hernow. She stood before him very upright, with a smile on her face thatlooked faintly ironical, as though she were wondering why he was so slowto act. The bluebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed to havefallen of their own accord. He took her hand.'Would you believe,' he said, 'that till this moment I didn't know whatcolour your eyes were?' They were brown, he noted, a rather light shade ofbrown, with dark lashes. 'Now that you've seen what I'm really like,can you still bear to look at me?''Yes, easily.''I'm thirty-nine years old. I've got a wife that I can't get rid of. I'vegot varicose veins. I've got five false teeth.''I couldn't care less,' said the girl.The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was in his arms.At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity. The youthfulbody was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against hisface, and yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing thewide red mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck, she was callinghim darling, precious one, loved one. He had pulled her down on to theground, she was utterly unresisting, he could do what he liked with her.But the truth was that he had no physical sensation, except that of merecontact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He was glad that this washappening, but he had no physical desire. It was too soon, her youth andprettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living withoutwomen--he did not know the reason. The girl picked herself up and pulled abluebell out of her hair. She sat against him, putting her arm round hiswaist.'Never mind, dear. There's no hurry. We've got the whole afternoon. Isn'tthis a splendid hide-out? I found it when I got lost once on a communityhike. If anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away.''What is your name?' said Winston.'Julia. I know yours. It's Winston--Winston Smith.''How did you find that out?''I expect I'm better at finding things out than you are, dear. Tell me,what did you think of me before that day I gave you the note?'He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. It was even a sort oflove-offering to start off by telling the worst.'I hated the sight of you,' he said. 'I wanted to rape you and then murderyou afterwards. Two weeks ago I thought seriously of smashing your head inwith a cobblestone. If you really want to know, I imagined that you hadsomething to do with the Thought Police.'The girl laughed delightedly, evidently taking this as atribute to the excellence of her disguise.'Not the Thought Police! You didn't honestly think that?''Well, perhaps not exactly that. But from your general appearance--merelybecause you're young and fresh and healthy, you understand--I thought thatprobably----''You thought I was a good Party member. Pure in word and deed. Banners,processions, slogans, games, community hikes all that stuff. And youthought that if I had a quarter of a chance I'd denounce you as athought-criminal and get you killed off?''Yes, something of that kind. A great many young girls are like that,you know.''It's this bloody thing that does it,' she said, ripping off the scarletsash of the Junior Anti-Sex League and flinging it on to a bough. Then,as though touching her waist had reminded her of something, she felt inthe pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. Shebroke it in half and gave one of the pieces to Winston. Even before he hadtaken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate. It wasdark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver paper. Chocolate normally wasdull-brown crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it,like the smoke of a rubbish fire. But at some time or another he had tastedchocolate like the piece she had given him. The first whiff of its scenthad stirred up some memory which he could not pin down, but which waspowerful and troubling.'Where did you get this stuff?' he said.'Black market,' she said indifferently. 'Actually I am that sort of girl,to look at. I'm good at games. I was a troop-leader in the Spies. I dovoluntary work three evenings a week for the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hoursand hours I've spent pasting their bloody rot all over London. I alwayscarry one end of a banner in the processions. I always look cheerful andI never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd, that's what I say.It's the only way to be safe.'The first fragment of chocolate had melted on Winston's tongue. The tastewas delightful. But there was still that memory moving round the edges ofhis consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to definiteshape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye. He pushed itaway from him, aware only that it was the memory of some action which hewould have liked to undo but could not.'You are very young,' he said. 'You are ten or fifteen years younger thanI am. What could you see to attract you in a man like me?''It was something in your face. I thought I'd take a chance. I'm good atspotting people who don't belong. As soon as I saw you I knew you wereagainst THEM.'THEM, it appeared, meant the Party, and above all the Inner Party, aboutwhom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made Winston feel uneasy,although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere.A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language.Party members were supposed not to swear, and Winston himself very seldomdid swear, aloud, at any rate. Julia, however, seemed unable to mentionthe Party, and especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of wordsthat you saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways. He did not dislike it. Itwas merely one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all its ways,and somehow it seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse thatsmells bad hay. They had left the clearing and were wandering againthrough the chequered shade, with their arms round each other's waistswhenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast. He noticed how muchsofter her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. They did notspeak above a whisper. Outside the clearing, Julia said, it was better togo quietly. Presently they had reached the edge of the little wood. Shestopped him.'Don't go out into the open. There might be someone watching. We're allright if we keep behind the boughs.'They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. The sunlight, filteringthrough innumerable leaves, was still hot on their faces. Winston lookedout into the field beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock ofrecognition. He knew it by sight. An old, close-bitten pasture, with afootpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the raggedhedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed justperceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly in densemasses like women's hair. Surely somewhere nearby, but out of sight,there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming?'Isn't there a stream somewhere near here?' he whispered.'That's right, there is a stream. It's at the edge of the next field,actually. There are fish in it, great big ones. You can watch them lyingin the pools under the willow trees, waving their tails.''It's the Golden Country--almost,' he murmured.'The Golden Country?''It's nothing, really. A landscape I've seen sometimes in a dream.''Look!' whispered Julia.A thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away, almost at the levelof their faces. Perhaps it had not seen them. It was in the sun, they inthe shade. It spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into placeagain, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisanceto the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In theafternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clungtogether, fascinated. The music went on and on, minute after minute, withastonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though thebird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stoppedfor a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled itsspeckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a sortof vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate,no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely woodand pour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether after all therewas a microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken only inlow whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it wouldpick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small,beetle-like man was listening intently--listening to that. But by degreesthe flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was asthough it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and gotmixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. He stoppedthinking and merely felt. The girl's waist in the bend of his arm was softand warm. He pulled her round so that they were breast to breast; her bodyseemed to melt into his. Wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding aswater. Their mouths clung together; it was quite different from the hardkisses they had exchanged earlier. When they moved their faces apart againboth of them sighed deeply. The bird took fright and fled with a clatterof wings.Winston put his lips against her ear. 'NOW,' he whispered.'Not here,' she whispered back. 'Come back to the hide-out. It's safer.'Quickly, with an occasional crackle of twigs, they threaded their way backto the clearing. When they were once inside the ring of saplings she turnedand faced him. They were both breathing fast, but the smile had reappearedround the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him for an instant,then felt at the zipper of her overalls. And, yes! it was almost as in hisdream. Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothesoff, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificentgesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. Her bodygleamed white in the sun. But for a moment he did not look at her body;his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint, bold smile.He knelt down before her and took her hands in his.'Have you done this before?''Of course. Hundreds of times--well, scores of times, anyway.''With Party members?''Yes, always with Party members.''With members of the Inner Party?''Not with those swine, no. But there's plenty that WOULD if they got halfa chance. They're not so holy as they make out.'His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he wished it had beenhundreds--thousands. Anything that hinted at corruption always filled himwith a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface,its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealinginiquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy orsyphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Anything to rot, to weaken, toundermine! He pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face.'Listen. The more men you've had, the more I love you. Do you understandthat?''Yes, perfectly.''I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don't want any virtue to exist anywhere.I want everyone to be corrupt to the bones.''Well then, I ought to suit you, dear. I'm corrupt to the bones.''You like doing this? I don't mean simply me: I mean the thing in itself?''I adore it.'That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely the love of oneperson but the animal instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire: thatwas the force that would tear the Party to pieces. He pressed her downupon the grass, among the fallen bluebells. This time there was nodifficulty. Presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed tonormal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. Thesun seemed to have grown hotter. They were both sleepy. He reached out forthe discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her. Almost immediatelythey fell asleep and slept for about half an hour.Winston woke first. He sat up and watched the freckled face, stillpeacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of her hand. Except for her mouth,you could not call her beautiful. There was a line or two round the eyes,if you looked closely. The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick andsoft. It occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or whereshe lived.The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in him a pitying,protecting feeling. But the mindless tenderness that he had felt underthe hazel tree, while the thrush was singing, had not quite come back.He pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank. In theold days, he thought, a man looked at a girl's body and saw that it wasdesirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could not have purelove or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because everything wasmixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climaxa victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.Chapter 3'We can come here once again,' said Julia. 'It's generally safe to use anyhide-out twice. But not for another month or two, of course.'As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. She became alert andbusiness-like, put her clothes on, knotted the scarlet sash about herwaist, and began arranging the details of the journey home. It seemednatural to leave this to her. She obviously had a practical cunning whichWinston lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of thecountryside round London, stored away from innumerable community hikes.The route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he hadcome, and brought him out at a different railway station. 'Never go homethe same way as you went out,' she said, as though enunciating an importantgeneral principle. She would leave first, and Winston was to wait half anhour before following her.She had named a place where they could meet after work, four eveningshence. It was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where there was anopen market which was generally crowded and noisy. She would be hangingabout among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces orsewing-thread. If she judged that the coast was clear she would blowher nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk past her withoutrecognition. But with luck, in the middle of the crowd, it would besafe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting.'And now I must go,' she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions.'I'm due back at nineteen-thirty. I've got to put in two hours for theJunior Anti-Sex League, handing out leaflets, or something. Isn't itbloody? Give me a brush-down, would you? Have I got any twigs in my hair?Are you sure? Then good-bye, my love, good-bye!'She flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost violently, and a momentlater pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the woodwith very little noise. Even now he had not found out her surname or heraddress. However, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable thatthey could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication.As it happened, they never went back to the clearing in the wood. Duringthe month of May there was only one further occasion on which they actuallysucceeded in making love. That was in another hiding-place known to Julia,the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of countrywhere an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. It was a goodhiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was verydangerous. For the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a differentplace every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. In thestreet it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As they drifteddown the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at oneanother, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flickedon and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silenceby the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, thentaken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptlycut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost withoutintroduction on the following day. Julia appeared to be quite used to thiskind of conversation, which she called 'talking by instalments'. She wasalso surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once inalmost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. Theywere passing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speak whenthey were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, theearth heaved, and the air darkened, and Winston found himself lying on hisside, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near athand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a few centimetres from hisown, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were white. She wasdead! He clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a livewarm face. But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of hislips. Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster.There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had towalk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come roundthe corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead. Even if it had beenless dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet.Winston's working week was sixty hours, Julia's was even longer, andtheir free days varied according to the pressure of work and did notoften coincide. Julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free.She spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures anddemonstrations, distributing literature for the junior Anti-Sex League,preparing banners for Hate Week, making collections for the savingscampaign, and such-like activities. It paid, she said, it was camouflage.If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. She even inducedWinston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself forthe part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Partymembers. So, one evening every week, Winston spent four hours of paralysingboredom, screwing together small bits of metal which were probably partsof bomb fuses, in a draughty, ill-lit workshop where the knocking ofhammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens.When they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentaryconversation were filled up. It was a blazing afternoon. The air in thelittle square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smeltoverpoweringly of pigeon dung. They sat talking for hours on the dusty,twig-littered floor, one or other of them getting up from time to time tocast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming.Julia was twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel with thirty othergirls ('Always in the stink of women! How I hate women!' she saidparenthetically), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the novel-writingmachines in the Fiction Department. She enjoyed her work, which consistedchiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor.She was 'not clever', but was fond of using her hands and felt at homewith machinery. She could describe the whole process of composing a novel,from the general directive issued by the Planning Committee down to thefinal touching-up by the Rewrite Squad. But she was not interested in thefinished product. She 'didn't much care for reading,' she said. Books werejust a commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces.She had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the onlyperson she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before theRevolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight. Atschool she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnasticstrophy two years running. She had been a troop-leader in the Spies and abranch secretary in the Youth League before joining the Junior Anti-SexLeague. She had always borne an excellent character. She had even (aninfallible mark of good reputation) been picked out to work in Pornosec,the sub-section of the Fiction Department which turned out cheappornography for distribution among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck Houseby the people who worked in it, she remarked. There she had remained fora year, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like'Spanking Stories' or 'One Night in a Girls' School', to be boughtfurtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that theywere buying something illegal.'What are these books like?' said Winston curiously.'Oh, ghastly rubbish. They're boring, really. They only have six plots,but they swap them round a bit. Of course I was only on the kaleidoscopes.I was never in the Rewrite Squad. I'm not literary, dear--not even enoughfor that.'He learned with astonishment that all the workers in Pornosec, except theheads of the departments, were girls. The theory was that men, whose sexinstincts were less controllable than those of women, were in greaterdanger of being corrupted by the filth they handled.'They don't even like having married women there,' she added. Girls arealways supposed to be so pure. Here's one who isn't, anyway.She had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen, with a Party memberof sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest. 'And a good job too,'said Julia, 'otherwise they'd have had my name out of him when heconfessed.' Since then there had been various others. Life as she saw itwas quite simple. You wanted a good time; 'they', meaning the Party,wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could. Sheseemed to think it just as natural that 'they' should want to rob you ofyour pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught. She hatedthe Party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no generalcriticism of it. Except where it touched upon her own life she had nointerest in Party doctrine. He noticed that she never used Newspeak wordsexcept the ones that had passed into everyday use. She had never heard ofthe Brotherhood, and refused to believe in its existence. Any kind oforganized revolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure,struck her as stupid. The clever thing was to break the rules and stayalive all the same. He wondered vaguely how many others like her theremight be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world ofthe Revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting the Party as somethingunalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simplyevading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog.They did not discuss the possibility of getting married. It was too remoteto be worth thinking about. No imaginable committee would ever sanctionsuch a marriage even if Katharine, Winston's wife, could somehow have beengot rid of. It was hopeless even as a daydream.'What was she like, your wife?' said Julia.'She was--do you know the Newspeak word GOODTHINKFUL? Meaning naturallyorthodox, incapable of thinking a bad thought?''No, I didn't know the word, but I know the kind of person, right enough.'He began telling her the story of his married life, but curiously enoughshe appeared to know the essential parts of it already. She describedto him, almost as though she had seen or felt it, the stiffening ofKatharine's body as soon as he touched her, the way in which she stillseemed to be pushing him from her with all her strength, even when herarms were clasped tightly round him. With Julia he felt no difficulty intalking about such things: Katharine, in any case, had long ceased to bea painful memory and became merely a distasteful one.'I could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing,' he said. He toldher about the frigid little ceremony that Katharine had forced him to gothrough on the same night every week. 'She hated it, but nothing wouldmake her stop doing it. She used to call it--but you'll never guess.''Our duty to the Party,' said Julia promptly.'How did you know that?''I've been at school too, dear. Sex talks once a month for theover-sixteens. And in the Youth Movement. They rub it into you for years.I dare say it works in a lot of cases. But of course you can never tell;people are such hypocrites.'She began to enlarge upon the subject. With Julia, everything came backto her own sexuality. As soon as this was touched upon in any way she wascapable of great acuteness. Unlike Winston, she had grasped the innermeaning of the Party's sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sexinstinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party's controland which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was moreimportant was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirablebecause it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The wayshe put it was:'When you make love you're using up energy; and afterwards you feel happyand don't give a damn for anything. They can't bear you to feel like that.They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marchingup and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. Ifyou're happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brotherand the Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest oftheir bloody rot?'That was very true, he thought. There was a direct intimate connexionbetween chastity and political orthodoxy. For how could the fear, thehatred, and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members bekept at the right pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinctand using it as a driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous to theParty, and the Party had turned it to account. They had played a similartrick with the instinct of parenthood. The family could not actually beabolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of theirchildren, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand,were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on themand report their deviations. The family had become in effect an extensionof the Thought Police. It was a device by means of which everyone could besurrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharine would unquestionablyhave denounced him to the Thought Police if she had not happened to be toostupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions. But what really recalledher to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, whichhad brought the sweat out on his forehead. He began telling Julia ofsomething that had happened, or rather had failed to happen, on anothersweltering summer afternoon, eleven years ago.It was three or four months after they were married. They had lost theirway on a community hike somewhere in Kent. They had only lagged behindthe others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, andpresently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalkquarry. It was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres, with boulders at thebottom. There was nobody of whom they could ask the way. As soon as sherealized that they were lost Katharine became very uneasy. To be awayfrom the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling ofwrong-doing. She wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and startsearching in the other direction. But at this moment Winston noticed sometufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them.One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick-red, apparently growing onthe same root. He had never seen anything of the kind before, and he calledto Katharine to come and look at it.'Look, Katharine! Look at those flowers. That clump down near the bottom.Do you see they're two different colours?'She had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully come back fora moment. She even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he waspointing. He was standing a little behind her, and he put his hand onher waist to steady her. At this moment it suddenly occurred to him howcompletely alone they were. There was not a human creature anywhere, not aleaf stirring, not even a bird awake. In a place like this the danger thatthere would be a hidden microphone was very small, and even if there was amicrophone it would only pick up sounds. It was the hottest sleepiest hourof the afternoon. The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled hisface. And the thought struck him...'Why didn't you give her a good shove?' said Julia. 'I would have.''Yes, dear, you would have. I would, if I'd been the same person then asI am now. Or perhaps I would--I'm not certain.''Are you sorry you didn't?''Yes. On the whole I'm sorry I didn't.'They were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. He pulled her closeragainst him. Her head rested on his shoulder, the pleasant smell of herhair conquering the pigeon dung. She was very young, he thought, shestill expected something from life, she did not understand that to pushan inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing.'Actually it would have made no difference,' he said.'Then why are you sorry you didn't do it?''Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In this game that we'replaying, we can't win. Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds,that's all.'He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. She always contradictedhim when he said anything of this kind. She would not accept it as a lawof nature that the individual is always defeated. In a way she realizedthat she herself was doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police wouldcatch her and kill her, but with another part of her mind she believedthat it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you couldlive as you chose. All you needed was luck and cunning and boldness. Shedid not understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that theonly victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead, that fromthe moment of declaring war on the Party it was better to think of yourselfas a corpse.'We are the dead,' he said.'We're not dead yet,' said Julia prosaically.'Not physically. Six months, a year--five years, conceivably. I am afraidof death. You are young, so presumably you're more afraid of it than I am.Obviously we shall put it off as long as we can. But it makes very littledifference. So long as human beings stay human, death and life are thesame thing.''Oh, rubbish! Which would you sooner sleep with, me or a skeleton? Don'tyou enjoy being alive? Don't you like feeling: This is me, this is my hand,this is my leg, I'm real, I'm solid, I'm alive! Don't you like THIS?'She twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him. He could feelher breasts, ripe yet firm, through her overalls. Her body seemed to bepouring some of its youth and vigour into his.'Yes, I like that,' he said.'Then stop talking about dying. And now listen, dear, we've got to fixup about the next time we meet. We may as well go back to the place inthe wood. We've given it a good long rest. But you must get there by adifferent way this time. I've got it all planned out. You take thetrain--but look, I'll draw it out for you.'And in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust,and with a twig from a pigeon's nest began drawing a map on the floor.Chapter 4Winston looked round the shabby little room above Mr Charrington's shop.Beside the window the enormous bed was made up, with ragged blankets anda coverless bolster. The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face wasticking away on the mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gateleg table, theglass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly outof the half-darkness.In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups,provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the burner and set a pan of waterto boil. He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and somesaccharine tablets. The clock's hands said seventeen-twenty: it wasnineteen-twenty really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty.Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, suicidal folly.Of all the crimes that a Party member could commit, this one was the leastpossible to conceal. Actually the idea had first floated into his head inthe form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surfaceof the gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had made nodifficulty about letting the room. He was obviously glad of the few dollarsthat it would bring him. Nor did he seem shocked or become offensivelyknowing when it was made clear that Winston wanted the room for the purposeof a love-affair. Instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke ingeneralities, with so delicate an air as to give the impression that hehad become partly invisible. Privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing.Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally. And whenthey had such a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knewof it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even, seeming almost to fadeout of existence as he did so, added that there were two entries to thehouse, one of them through the back yard, which gave on an alley.Under the window somebody was singing. Winston peeped out, secure in theprotection of the muslin curtain. The June sun was still high in the sky,and in the sun-filled court below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Normanpillar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about hermiddle, was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line,pegging out a series of square white things which Winston recognized asbabies' diapers. Whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs shewas singing in a powerful contralto:  It was only an 'opeless fancy.  It passed like an Ipril dye,  But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred!  They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!The tune had been haunting London for weeks past. It was one of countlesssimilar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a sub-section ofthe Music Department. The words of these songs were composed without anyhuman intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator.But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into analmost pleasant sound. He could hear the woman singing and the scrape ofher shoes on the flagstones, and the cries of the children in the street,and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet theroom seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of a telescreen.Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceivable that they couldfrequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught. Butthe temptation of having a hiding-place that was truly their own, indoorsand near at hand, had been too much for both of them. For some timeafter their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrangemeetings. Working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation ofHate Week. It was more than a month distant, but the enormous, complexpreparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody.Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day.They had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. On the eveningbeforehand they met briefly in the street. As usual, Winston hardly lookedat Julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd, but from theshort glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual.'It's all off,' she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak.'Tomorrow, I mean.''What?''Tomorrow afternoon. I can't come.''Why not?''Oh, the usual reason. It's started early this time.'For a moment he was violently angry. During the month that he had knownher the nature of his desire for her had changed. At the beginning therehad been little true sensuality in it. Their first love-making had beensimply an act of the will. But after the second time it was different. Thesmell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemedto have got inside him, or into the air all round him. She had become aphysical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that hehad a right to. When she said that she could not come, he had the feelingthat she was cheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressedthem together and their hands accidentally met. She gave the tips of hisfingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection. Itstruck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointmentmust be a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he hadnot felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He wished that theywere a married couple of ten years' standing. He wished that he werewalking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openlyand without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for thehousehold. He wished above all that they had some place where they couldbe alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every timethey met. It was not actually at that moment, but at some time on thefollowing day, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington's room had occurredto him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpectedreadiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they wereintentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on theedge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one'sconsciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death assurely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhapspostpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilfulact, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia burst into theroom. She was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas, such as he hadsometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry. He started forwardto take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly,partly because she was still holding the tool-bag.'Half a second,' she said. 'Just let me show you what I've brought. Didyou bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee? I thought you would. Youcan chuck it away again, because we shan't be needing it. Look here.'She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out some spannersand a screwdriver that filled the top part of it. Underneath were a numberof neat paper packets. The first packet that she passed to Winston had astrange and yet vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind ofheavy, sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touched it.'It isn't sugar?' he said.'Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here's a loaf of bread--properwhite bread, not our bloody stuff--and a little pot of jam. And here's atin of milk--but look! This is the one I'm really proud of. I had to wrapa bit of sacking round it, because----'But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up. The smell wasalready filling the room, a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanationfrom his early childhood, but which one did occasionally meet with evennow, blowing down a passage-way before a door slammed, or diffusing itselfmysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant and then lostagain.'It's coffee,' he murmured, 'real coffee.''It's Inner Party coffee. There's a whole kilo here,' she said.'How did you manage to get hold of all these things?''It's all Inner Party stuff. There's nothing those swine don't have,nothing. But of course waiters and servants and people pinch things,and--look, I got a little packet of tea as well.'Winston had squatted down beside her. He tore open a corner of the packet.'It's real tea. Not blackberry leaves.''There's been a lot of tea about lately. They've captured India, orsomething,' she said vaguely. 'But listen, dear. I want you to turn yourback on me for three minutes. Go and sit on the other side of the bed.Don't go too near the window. And don't turn round till I tell you.'Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain. Down in the yardthe red-armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub andthe line. She took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deepfeeling:  They sye that time 'eals all things,  They sye you can always forget;  But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years  They twist my 'eart-strings yet!She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed. Her voice floatedupward with the sweet summer air, very tuneful, charged with a sort ofhappy melancholy. One had the feeling that she would have been perfectlycontent, if the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothesinexhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging out diapersand singing rubbish. It struck him as a curious fact that he had neverheard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously. It would evenhave seemed slightly unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking tooneself. Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvationlevel that they had anything to sing about.'You can turn round now,' said Julia.He turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her. What hehad actually expected was to see her naked. But she was not naked. Thetransformation that had happened was much more surprising than that. Shehad painted her face.She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and boughtherself a complete set of make-up materials. Her lips were deeply reddened,her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of somethingunder the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully done, butWinston's standards in such matters were not high. He had never beforeseen or imagined a woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face. Theimprovement in her appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colourin the right places she had become not only very much prettier, but, aboveall, far more feminine. Her short hair and boyish overalls merely addedto the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violetsflooded his nostrils. He remembered the half-darkness of a basementkitchen, and a woman's cavernous mouth. It was the very same scent thatshe had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.'Scent too!' he said.'Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I'm going to do next? I'mgoing to get hold of a real woman's frock from somewhere and wear itinstead of these bloody trousers. I'll wear silk stockings and high-heeledshoes! In this room I'm going to be a woman, not a Party comrade.'They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed. Itwas the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence.Until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body, withthe varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patchover his ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on wasthreadbare and smooth, and the size and springiness of the bed astonishedboth of them. 'It's sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?' said Julia.One never saw a double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles.Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Julia had never beenin one before, so far as she could remember.Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Winston woke up thehands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. He did not stir, becauseJulia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. Most of hermake-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a lightstain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow rayfrom the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up thefireplace, where the water in the pan was boiling fast. Down in the yardthe woman had stopped singing, but the faint shouts of children floated infrom the street. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it hadbeen a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summerevening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose,talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simplylying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely there couldnever have been a time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up, rubbedher eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove.'Half that water's boiled away,' she said. 'I'll get up and make somecoffee in another moment. We've got an hour. What time do they cut thelights off at your flats?''Twenty-three thirty.''It's twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to get in earlier than that,because--Hi! Get out, you filthy brute!'She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a shoe from the floor,and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm, exactlyas he had seen her fling the dictionary at Goldstein, that morning duringthe Two Minutes Hate.'What was it?' he said in surprise.'A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting. There's ahole down there. I gave him a good fright, anyway.''Rats!' murmured Winston. 'In this room!''They're all over the place,' said Julia indifferently as she lay downagain. 'We've even got them in the kitchen at the hostel. Some parts ofLondon are swarming with them. Did you know they attack children? Yes,they do. In some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone fortwo minutes. It's the great huge brown ones that do it. And the nastything is that the brutes always----''DON'T GO ON!' said Winston, with his eyes tightly shut.'Dearest! You've gone quite pale. What's the matter? Do they make you feelsick?''Of all horrors in the world--a rat!'She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him, as thoughto reassure him with the warmth of her body. He did not reopen his eyesimmediately. For several moments he had had the feeling of being back in anightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. It wasalways very much the same. He was standing in front of a wall of darkness,and on the other side of it there was something unendurable, something toodreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was always one ofself-deception, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall ofdarkness. With a deadly effort, like wrenching a piece out of his ownbrain, he could even have dragged the thing into the open. He always wokeup without discovering what it was: but somehow it was connected with whatJulia had been saying when he cut her short.'I'm sorry,' he said, 'it's nothing. I don't like rats, that's all.''Don't worry, dear, we're not going to have the filthy brutes in here.I'll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go. And next time wecome here I'll bring some plaster and bung it up properly.'Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. Feeling slightlyashamed of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. Julia got out of bed,pulled on her overalls, and made the coffee. The smell that rose from thesaucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lestanybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive. What was evenbetter than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it bythe sugar, a thing Winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine.With one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other,Julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the bookcase,pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping herselfdown in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable, and examiningthe absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. She broughtthe glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a betterlight. He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft,rainwatery appearance of the glass.'What is it, do you think?' said Julia.'I don't think it's anything--I mean, I don't think it was ever put to anyuse. That's what I like about it. It's a little chunk of history thatthey've forgotten to alter. It's a message from a hundred years ago, ifone knew how to read it.''And that picture over there'--she nodded at the engraving on the oppositewall--'would that be a hundred years old?''More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can't tell. It's impossible to discoverthe age of anything nowadays.'She went over to look at it. 'Here's where that brute stuck his nose out,'she said, kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture. 'What isthis place? I've seen it before somewhere.''It's a church, or at least it used to be. St Clement Danes its name was.'The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington had taught him came back intohis head, and he added half-nostalgically: "Oranges and lemons, say thebells of St Clement's!"To his astonishment she capped the line:  'You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,  When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey----''I can't remember how it goes on after that. But anyway I remember it endsup, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chopoff your head!"'It was like the two halves of a countersign. But there must be anotherline after 'the bells of Old Bailey'. Perhaps it could be dug out ofMr Charrington's memory, if he were suitably prompted.'Who taught you that?' he said.'My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a little girl. He wasvaporized when I was eight--at any rate, he disappeared. I wonder what alemon was,' she added inconsequently. 'I've seen oranges. They're a kindof round yellow fruit with a thick skin.''I can remember lemons,' said Winston. 'They were quite common in thefifties. They were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smellthem.''I bet that picture's got bugs behind it,' said Julia. 'I'll take it downand give it a good clean some day. I suppose it's almost time we wereleaving. I must start washing this paint off. What a bore! I'll get thelipstick off your face afterwards.'Winston did not get up for a few minutes more. The room was darkening. Heturned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight.The inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but theinterior of the glass itself. There was such a depth of it, and yet it wasalmost as transparent as air. It was as though the surface of the glasshad been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmospherecomplete. He had the feeling that he could get inside it, and that infact he was inside it, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table,and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself. Thepaperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was Julia's life and hisown, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.Chapter 5Syme had vanished. A morning came, and he was missing from work: a fewthoughtless people commented on his absence. On the next day nobodymentioned him. On the third day Winston went into the vestibule of theRecords Department to look at the notice-board. One of the notices carrieda printed list of the members of the Chess Committee, of whom Syme hadbeen one. It looked almost exactly as it had looked before--nothing hadbeen crossed out--but it was one name shorter. It was enough. Syme hadceased to exist: he had never existed.The weather was baking hot. In the labyrinthine Ministry the windowless,air-conditioned rooms kept their normal temperature, but outside thepavements scorched one's feet and the stench of the Tubes at the rush hourswas a horror. The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, and thestaffs of all the Ministries were working overtime. Processions, meetings,military parades, lectures, waxworks, displays, film shows, telescreenprogrammes all had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigiesbuilt, slogans coined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographsfaked. Julia's unit in the Fiction Department had been taken off theproduction of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets.Winston, in addition to his regular work, spent long periods every day ingoing through back files of 'The Times' and altering and embellishing newsitems which were to be quoted in speeches. Late at night, when crowds ofrowdy proles roamed the streets, the town had a curiously febrile air. Therocket bombs crashed oftener than ever, and sometimes in the far distancethere were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about whichthere were wild rumours.The new tune which was to be the theme-song of Hate Week (the Hate Song,it was called) had already been composed and was being endlessly pluggedon the telescreens. It had a savage, barking rhythm which could not exactlybe called music, but resembled the beating of a drum. Roared out byhundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, it was terrifying. Theproles had taken a fancy to it, and in the midnight streets it competedwith the still-popular 'It was only a hopeless fancy'. The Parsons childrenplayed it at all hours of the night and day, unbearably, on a comb and apiece of toilet paper. Winston's evenings were fuller than ever. Squads ofvolunteers, organized by Parsons, were preparing the street for Hate Week,stitching banners, painting posters, erecting flagstaffs on the roofs, andperilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers.Parsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would display four hundredmetres of bunting. He was in his native element and as happy as a lark.The heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for revertingto shorts and an open shirt in the evenings. He was everywhere at once,pushing, pulling, sawing, hammering, improvising, jollying everyone alongwith comradely exhortations and giving out from every fold of his body whatseemed an inexhaustible supply of acrid-smelling sweat.A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London. It had no caption,and represented simply the monstrous figure of a Eurasian soldier, threeor four metres high, striding forward with expressionless Mongolian faceand enormous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. From whateverangle you looked at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified by theforeshortening, seemed to be pointed straight at you. The thing had beenplastered on every blank space on every wall, even outnumbering theportraits of Big Brother. The proles, normally apathetic about the war,were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism.As though to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had beenkilling larger numbers of people than usual. One fell on a crowded filmtheatre in Stepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins. Thewhole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long, trailingfuneral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting.Another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playgroundand several dozen children were blown to pieces. There were further angrydemonstrations, Goldstein was burned in effigy, hundreds of copies of theposter of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames, anda number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew roundthat spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, andan old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had theirhouse set on fire and perished of suffocation.In the room over Mr Charrington's shop, when they could get there, Juliaand Winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window,naked for the sake of coolness. The rat had never come back, but the bugshad multiplied hideously in the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty orclean, the room was paradise. As soon as they arrived they would sprinkleeverything with pepper bought on the black market, tear off their clothes,and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find thatthe bugs had rallied and were massing for the counter-attack.Four, five, six--seven times they met during the month of June. Winstonhad dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. He seemed to have lostthe need for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided,leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits ofcoughing in the early morning had stopped. The process of life had ceasedto be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at thetelescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice. Now that they had asecure hiding-place, almost a home, it did not even seem a hardship thatthey could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time.What mattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist. To knowthat it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. The roomwas a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk.Mr Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal. He usuallystopped to talk with Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs.The old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors, and on the otherhand to have almost no customers. He led a ghostlike existence between thetiny, dark shop, and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared hismeals and which contained, among other things, an unbelievably ancientgramophone with an enormous horn. He seemed glad of the opportunity totalk. Wandering about among his worthless stock, with his long nose andthick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket, he hadalways vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman.With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish orthat--a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken snuffbox, apinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby's hair--neverasking that Winston should buy it, merely that he should admire it. Totalk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical-box.He had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments offorgotten rhymes. There was one about four and twenty blackbirds, andanother about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the deathof poor Cock Robin. 'It just occurred to me you might be interested,' hewould say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a newfragment. But he could never recall more than a few lines of any onerhyme.Both of them knew--in a way, it was never out of their minds that whatwas now happening could not last long. There were times when the fact ofimpending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they wouldcling together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned soulgrasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within fiveminutes of striking. But there were also times when they had the illusionnot only of safety but of permanence. So long as they were actually inthis room, they both felt, no harm could come to them. Getting there wasdifficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It was as whenWinston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling thatit would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once insideit time could be arrested. Often they gave themselves up to daydreams ofescape. Their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on theirintrigue, just like this, for the remainder of their natural lives. OrKatharine would die, and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston and Julia wouldsucceed in getting married. Or they would commit suicide together. Orthey would disappear, alter themselves out of recognition, learn to speakwith proletarian accents, get jobs in a factory and live out their livesundetected in a back-street. It was all nonsense, as they both knew. Inreality there was no escape. Even the one plan that was practicable,suicide, they had no intention of carrying out. To hang on from day to dayand from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemedan unconquerable instinct, just as one's lungs will always draw the nextbreath so long as there is air available.Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion against theParty, but with no notion of how to take the first step. Even if thefabulous Brotherhood was a reality, there still remained the difficultyof finding one's way into it. He told her of the strange intimacy thatexisted, or seemed to exist, between himself and O'Brien, and of theimpulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into O'Brien's presence, announcethat he was the enemy of the Party, and demand his help. Curiously enough,this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do. She was used tojudging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that Winstonshould believe O'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flashof the eyes. Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearlyeveryone, secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thoughtit safe to do so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organizedopposition existed or could exist. The tales about Goldstein and hisunderground army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the Partyhad invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believein. Times beyond number, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations,she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whosenames she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not thefaintest belief. When public trials were happening she had taken her placein the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts frommorning to night, chanting at intervals 'Death to the traitors!' Duringthe Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insultsat Goldstein. Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Goldstein was andwhat doctrines he was supposed to represent. She had grown up since theRevolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of thefifties and sixties. Such a thing as an independent political movement wasoutside her imagination: and in any case the Party was invincible. Itwould always exist, and it would always be the same. You could only rebelagainst it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts ofviolence such as killing somebody or blowing something up.In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and far less susceptibleto Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connexion to mentionthe war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in heropinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily onLondon were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, 'just tokeep people frightened'. This was an idea that had literally never occurredto him. She also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that duringthe Two Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting outlaughing. But she only questioned the teachings of the Party when theyin some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to acceptthe official mythology, simply because the difference between truth andfalsehood did not seem important to her. She believed, for instance, havinglearnt it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. (In his ownschooldays, Winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only thehelicopter that the Party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later,when Julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane; onegeneration more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when hetold her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and longbefore the Revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting. Afterall, what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was rather moreof a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she didnot remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasiaand at peace with Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war asa sham: but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemyhad changed. 'I thought we'd always been at war with Eurasia,' she saidvaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aeroplanes datedfrom long before her birth, but the switchover in the war had happenedonly four years ago, well after she was grown up. He argued with her aboutit for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcingher memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time Eastasia andnot Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still struck her asunimportant. 'Who cares?' she said impatiently. 'It's always one bloodywar after another, and one knows the news is all lies anyway.'Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department and the impudentforgeries that he committed there. Such things did not appear to horrifyher. She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thoughtof lies becoming truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, andRutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held betweenhis fingers. It did not make much impression on her. At first, indeed, shefailed to grasp the point of the story.'Were they friends of yours?' she said.'No, I never knew them. They were Inner Party members. Besides, they werefar older men than I was. They belonged to the old days, before theRevolution. I barely knew them by sight.''Then what was there to worry about? People are being killed off all thetime, aren't they?'He tried to make her understand. 'This was an exceptional case. It wasn'tjust a question of somebody being killed. Do you realize that the past,starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survivesanywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, likethat lump of glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing aboutthe Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has beendestroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture hasbeen repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed,every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day andminute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endlesspresent in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that thepast is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, evenwhen I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidenceever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't knowwith any certainty that any other human being shares my memories. Just inthat one instance, in my whole life, I did possess actual concrete evidenceafter the event--years after it.''And what good was that?''It was no good, because I threw it away a few minutes later. But if thesame thing happened today, I should keep it.''Well, I wouldn't!' said Julia. 'I'm quite ready to take risks, but onlyfor something worth while, not for bits of old newspaper. What could youhave done with it even if you had kept it?''Not much, perhaps. But it was evidence. It might have planted a few doubtshere and there, supposing that I'd dared to show it to anybody. I don'timagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime. But one can imaginelittle knots of resistance springing up here and there--small groups ofpeople banding themselves together, and gradually growing, and even leavinga few records behind, so that the next generations can carry on where weleave off.''I'm not interested in the next generation, dear. I'm interested in US.''You're only a rebel from the waist downwards,' he told her.She thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms round him in delight.In the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest.Whenever he began to talk of the principles of Ingsoc, doublethink, themutability of the past, and the denial of objective reality, and to useNewspeak words, she became bored and confused and said that she never paidany attention to that kind of thing. One knew that it was all rubbish, sowhy let oneself be worried by it? She knew when to cheer and when to boo,and that was all one needed. If he persisted in talking of such subjects,she had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep. She was one of thosepeople who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position. Talking to her,he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy whilehaving no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant. In a way, the world-viewof the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable ofunderstanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violationsof reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what wasdemanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events tonotice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane.They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm,because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will passundigested through the body of a bird.Chapter 6It had happened at last. The expected message had come. All his life, itseemed to him, he had been waiting for this to happen.He was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry and he was almostat the spot where Julia had slipped the note into his hand when he becameaware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him. Theperson, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude tospeaking. Winston stopped abruptly and turned. It was O'Brien.At last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse wasto run away. His heart bounded violently. He would have been incapable ofspeaking. O'Brien, however, had continued forward in the same movement,laying a friendly hand for a moment on Winston's arm, so that the two ofthem were walking side by side. He began speaking with the peculiar gravecourtesy that differentiated him from the majority of Inner Party members.'I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,' he said. 'I wasreading one of your Newspeak articles in 'The Times' the other day. Youtake a scholarly interest in Newspeak, I believe?'Winston had recovered part of his self-possession. 'Hardly scholarly,' hesaid. 'I'm only an amateur. It's not my subject. I have never had anythingto do with the actual construction of the language.''But you write it very elegantly,' said O'Brien. 'That is not only my ownopinion. I was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly anexpert. His name has slipped my memory for the moment.'Again Winston's heart stirred painfully. It was inconceivable that thiswas anything other than a reference to Syme. But Syme was not only dead,he was abolished, an unperson. Any identifiable reference to him would havebeen mortally dangerous. O'Brien's remark must obviously have been intendedas a signal, a codeword. By sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he hadturned the two of them into accomplices. They had continued to strollslowly down the corridor, but now O'Brien halted. With the curious,disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture heresettled his spectacles on his nose. Then he went on:'What I had really intended to say was that in your article I noticed youhad used two words which have become obsolete. But they have only becomeso very recently. Have you seen the tenth edition of the NewspeakDictionary?''No,' said Winston. 'I didn't think it had been issued yet. We are stillusing the ninth in the Records Department.''The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months, I believe. But afew advance copies have been circulated. I have one myself. It mightinterest you to look at it, perhaps?''Very much so,' said Winston, immediately seeing where this tended.'Some of the new developments are most ingenious. The reduction in thenumber of verbs--that is the point that will appeal to you, I think. Letme see, shall I send a messenger to you with the dictionary? But I amafraid I invariably forget anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pickit up at my flat at some time that suited you? Wait. Let me give you myaddress.'They were standing in front of a telescreen. Somewhat absent-mindedlyO'Brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather-coverednotebook and a gold ink-pencil. Immediately beneath the telescreen, insuch a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of theinstrument could read what he was writing, he scribbled an address, toreout the page and handed it to Winston.'I am usually at home in the evenings,' he said. 'If not, my servant willgive you the dictionary.'He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper, which this timethere was no need to conceal. Nevertheless he carefully memorized what waswritten on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole alongwith a mass of other papers.They had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most.There was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have. It hadbeen contrived as a way of letting Winston know O'Brien's address. Thiswas necessary, because except by direct enquiry it was never possible todiscover where anyone lived. There were no directories of any kind. 'Ifyou ever want to see me, this is where I can be found,' was what O'Brienhad been saying to him. Perhaps there would even be a message concealedsomewhere in the dictionary. But at any rate, one thing was certain. Theconspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and he had reached the outeredges of it.He knew that sooner or later he would obey O'Brien's summons. Perhapstomorrow, perhaps after a long delay--he was not certain. What washappening was only the working-out of a process that had started yearsago. The first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the secondhad been the opening of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to words,and now from words to actions. The last step was something that wouldhappen in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted it. The end was containedin the beginning. But it was frightening: or, more exactly, it was likea foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. Even while he wasspeaking to O'Brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a chillyshuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. He had the sensationof stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much betterbecause he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him.Chapter 7Winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. Julia rolled sleepilyagainst him, murmuring something that might have been 'What's the matter?''I dreamt--' he began, and stopped short. It was too complex to be putinto words. There was the dream itself, and there was a memory connectedwith it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking.He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmosphere of thedream. It was a vast, luminous dream in which his whole life seemed tostretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain.It had all occurred inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of theglass was the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything was floodedwith clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances.The dream had also been comprehended by--indeed, in some sense it hadconsisted in--a gesture of the arm made by his mother, and made againthirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on the news film,trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the helicopterblew them both to pieces.'Do you know,' he said, 'that until this moment I believed I had murderedmy mother?''Why did you murder her?' said Julia, almost asleep.'I didn't murder her. Not physically.'In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother, and withina few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had allcome back. It was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out ofhis consciousness over many years. He was not certain of the date, but hecould not have been less than ten years old, possibly twelve, when it hadhappened.His father had disappeared some time earlier, how much earlier he couldnot remember. He remembered better the rackety, uneasy circumstances ofthe time: the periodical panics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tubestations, the piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proclamationsposted at street corners, the gangs of youths in shirts all the samecolour, the enormous queues outside the bakeries, the intermittentmachine-gun fire in the distance--above all, the fact that there wasnever enough to eat. He remembered long afternoons spent with other boysin scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps, picking out the ribs ofcabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrustfrom which they carefully scraped away the cinders; and also in waitingfor the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and wereknown to carry cattle feed, and which, when they jolted over the badpatches in the road, sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil-cake.When his father disappeared, his mother did not show any surprise or anyviolent grief, but a sudden change came over her. She seemed to havebecome completely spiritless. It was evident even to Winston that she waswaiting for something that she knew must happen. She did everything thatwas needed--cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, swept the floor, dustedthe mantelpiece--always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluousmotion, like an artist's lay-figure moving of its own accord. Her largeshapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. For hours at atime she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nursing his young sister,a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two or three, with a face made simianby thinness. Very occasionally she would take Winston in her arms andpress him against her for a long time without saying anything. He wasaware, in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness, that this was somehowconnected with the never-mentioned thing that was about to happen.He remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close-smelling room thatseemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane. There was a gas ringin the fender, and a shelf where food was kept, and on the landing outsidethere was a brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. He rememberedhis mother's statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at somethingin a saucepan. Above all he remembered his continuous hunger, and thefierce sordid battles at mealtimes. He would ask his mother naggingly,over and over again, why there was not more food, he would shout and stormat her (he even remembered the tones of his voice, which was beginning tobreak prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he wouldattempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than hisshare. His mother was quite ready to give him more than his share. Shetook it for granted that he, 'the boy', should have the biggest portion;but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more. At every mealshe would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his littlesister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. He would cry outwith rage when she stopped ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepanand spoon out of her hands, he would grab bits from his sister's plate.He knew that he was starving the other two, but he could not help it; heeven felt that he had a right to do it. The clamorous hunger in his bellyseemed to justify him. Between meals, if his mother did not stand guard,he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf.One day a chocolate ration was issued. There had been no such issue forweeks or months past. He remembered quite clearly that precious littlemorsel of chocolate. It was a two-ounce slab (they still talked aboutounces in those days) between the three of them. It was obvious that itought to be divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he werelistening to somebody else, Winston heard himself demanding in a loudbooming voice that he should be given the whole piece. His mother told himnot to be greedy. There was a long, nagging argument that went round andround, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings. His tinysister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a baby monkey,sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. In theend his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it toWinston, giving the other quarter to his sister. The little girl took holdof it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. Winstonstood watching her for a moment. Then with a sudden swift spring he hadsnatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister's hand and was fleeingfor the door.'Winston, Winston!' his mother called after him. 'Come back! Give yoursister back her chocolate!'He stopped, but did not come back. His mother's anxious eyes were fixed onhis face. Even now he was thinking about the thing, he did not know whatit was that was on the point of happening. His sister, conscious of havingbeen robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. His mother drew herarm round the child and pressed its face against her breast. Something inthe gesture told him that his sister was dying. He turned and fled downthe stairs, with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand.He never saw his mother again. After he had devoured the chocolate he feltsomewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for severalhours, until hunger drove him home. When he came back his mother haddisappeared. This was already becoming normal at that time. Nothing wasgone from the room except his mother and his sister. They had not takenany clothes, not even his mother's overcoat. To this day he did not knowwith any certainty that his mother was dead. It was perfectly possiblethat she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for his sister,she might have been removed, like Winston himself, to one of the coloniesfor homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were called) which hadgrown up as a result of the civil war, or she might have been sent to thelabour camp along with his mother, or simply left somewhere or otherto die.The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping protectinggesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained. Hismind went back to another dream of two months ago. Exactly as his motherhad sat on the dingy white-quilted bed, with the child clinging to her, soshe had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him, and drowning deeperevery minute, but still looking up at him through the darkening water.He told Julia the story of his mother's disappearance. Without opening hereyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position.'I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,' she saidindistinctly. 'All children are swine.''Yes. But the real point of the story----'From her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again.He would have liked to continue talking about his mother. He did notsuppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an unusualwoman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind ofnobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyedwere private ones. Her feelings were her own, and could not be alteredfrom outside. It would not have occurred to her that an action which isineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If you loved someone, you lovedhim, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. Whenthe last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child inher arms. It was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce morechocolate, it did not avert the child's death or her own; but it seemednatural to her to do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also coveredthe little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the bulletsthan a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Party had done was topersuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, whileat the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. Whenonce you were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel,what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference.Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were everheard of again. You were lifted clean out of the stream of history. Andyet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemedall-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. Theywere governed by private loyalties which they did not question. Whatmattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture,an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value initself. The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in thiscondition. They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, theywere loyal to one another. For the first time in his life he did notdespise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which wouldone day spring to life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayedhuman. They had not become hardened inside. They had held on to theprimitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort.And in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a fewweeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kickedit into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk.'The proles are human beings,' he said aloud. 'We are not human.''Why not?' said Julia, who had woken up again.He thought for a little while. 'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said,'that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of herebefore it's too late, and never see each other again?''Yes, dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I'm not going to doit, all the same.''We've been lucky,' he said 'but it can't last much longer. You're young.You look normal and innocent. If you keep clear of people like me, youmight stay alive for another fifty years.''No. I've thought it all out. What you do, I'm going to do. And don't betoo downhearted. I'm rather good at staying alive.''We may be together for another six months--a year--there's no knowing.At the end we're certain to be apart. Do you realize how utterly alone weshall be? When once they get hold of us there will be nothing, literallynothing, that either of us can do for the other. If I confess, they'llshoot you, and if I refuse to confess, they'll shoot you just the same.Nothing that I can do or say, or stop myself from saying, will put offyour death for as much as five minutes. Neither of us will even knowwhether the other is alive or dead. We shall be utterly without power ofany kind. The one thing that matters is that we shouldn't betray oneanother, although even that can't make the slightest difference.''If you mean confessing,' she said, 'we shall do that, right enough.Everybody always confesses. You can't help it. They torture you.''I don't mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. What you say or dodoesn't matter: only feelings matter. If they could make me stop lovingyou--that would be the real betrayal.'She thought it over. 'They can't do that,' she said finally. 'It's the onething they can't do. They can make you say anything--ANYTHING--but theycan't make you believe it. They can't get inside you.''No,' he said a little more hopefully, 'no; that's quite true. They can'tget inside you. If you can FEEL that staying human is worth while, evenwhen it can't have any result whatever, you've beaten them.'He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear. They could spyupon you night and day, but if you kept your head you could still outwitthem. With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret offinding out what another human being was thinking. Perhaps that was lesstrue when you were actually in their hands. One did not know what happenedinside the Ministry of Love, but it was possible to guess: tortures, drugs,delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions, gradualwearing-down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning.Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They could be tracked downby enquiry, they could be squeezed out of you by torture. But if the objectwas not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference did it ultimatelymake? They could not alter your feelings: for that matter you could notalter them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in theutmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but theinner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remainedimpregnable.Chapter 8They had done it, they had done it at last!The room they were standing in was long-shaped and softly lit. Thetelescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the richness of the dark-blue carpetgave one the impression of treading on velvet. At the far end of the roomO'Brien was sitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass ofpapers on either side of him. He had not bothered to look up when theservant showed Julia and Winston in.Winston's heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would beable to speak. They had done it, they had done it at last, was all hecould think. It had been a rash act to come here at all, and sheer follyto arrive together; though it was true that they had come by differentroutes and only met on O'Brien's doorstep. But merely to walk into such aplace needed an effort of the nerve. It was only on very rare occasionsthat one saw inside the dwelling-places of the Inner Party, or evenpenetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived. The wholeatmosphere of the huge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness ofeverything, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco, thesilent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the white-jacketedservants hurrying to and fro--everything was intimidating. Although he hada good pretext for coming here, he was haunted at every step by the fearthat a black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner,demand his papers, and order him to get out. O'Brien's servant, however,had admitted the two of them without demur. He was a small, dark-hairedman in a white jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionlessface which might have been that of a Chinese. The passage down which heled them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and whitewainscoting, all exquisitely clean. That too was intimidating. Winstoncould not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were notgrimy from the contact of human bodies.O'Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studyingit intently. His heavy face, bent down so that one could see the line ofthe nose, looked both formidable and intelligent. For perhaps twentyseconds he sat without stirring. Then he pulled the speakwrite towardshim and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the Ministries:'Items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestioncontained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stopunproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machineryoverheads stop end message.'He rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across thesoundless carpet. A little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallenaway from him with the Newspeak words, but his expression was grimmer thanusual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. The terror thatWinston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinaryembarrassment. It seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made astupid mistake. For what evidence had he in reality that O'Brien was anykind of political conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyes and a singleequivocal remark: beyond that, only his own secret imaginings, founded ona dream. He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come toborrow the dictionary, because in that case Julia's presence was impossibleto explain. As O'Brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strikehim. He stopped, turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall. There wasa sharp snap. The voice had stopped.Julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. Even in the midstof his panic, Winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold histongue.'You can turn it off!' he said.'Yes,' said O'Brien, 'we can turn it off. We have that privilege.'He was opposite them now. His solid form towered over the pair of them,and the expression on his face was still indecipherable. He was waiting,somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what? Even now it wasquite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why hehad been interrupted. Nobody spoke. After the stopping of the telescreenthe room seemed deadly silent. The seconds marched past, enormous. Withdifficulty Winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O'Brien's. Thensuddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginningsof a smile. With his characteristic gesture O'Brien resettled hisspectacles on his nose.'Shall I say it, or will you?' he said.'I will say it,' said Winston promptly. 'That thing is really turned off?''Yes, everything is turned off. We are alone.''We have come here because----'He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness ofhis own motives. Since he did not in fact know what kind ofhelp he expected from O'Brien, it was not easy to say why hehad come here. He went on, conscious that what he was sayingmust sound both feeble and pretentious:'We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy, some kind of secretorganization working against the Party, and that you are involved in it.We want to join it and work for it. We are enemies of the Party. Wedisbelieve in the principles of Ingsoc. We are thought-criminals. We arealso adulterers. I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at yourmercy. If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way, we areready.'He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling that the doorhad opened. Sure enough, the little yellow-faced servant had come inwithout knocking. Winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanterand glasses.'Martin is one of us,' said O'Brien impassively. 'Bring the drinks overhere, Martin. Put them on the round table. Have we enough chairs? Thenwe may as well sit down and talk in comfort. Bring a chair for yourself,Martin. This is business. You can stop being a servant for the next tenminutes.'The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with aservant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. Winstonregarded him out of the corner of his eye. It struck him that the man'swhole life was playing a part, and that he felt it to be dangerous todrop his assumed personality even for a moment. O'Brien took the decanterby the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. It arousedin Winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or ahoarding--a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to moveup and down and pour its contents into a glass. Seen from the top thestuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby.It had a sour-sweet smell. He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff atit with frank curiosity.'It is called wine,' said O'Brien with a faint smile. 'You will have readabout it in books, no doubt. Not much of it gets to the Outer Party, I amafraid.' His face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: 'I think itis fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. To our Leader: ToEmmanuel Goldstein.'Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. Wine was a thing hehad read and dreamed about. Like the glass paperweight or Mr Charrington'shalf-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, theolden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reasonhe had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, likethat of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect. Actually,when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing. Thetruth was that after years of gin-drinking he could barely taste it. Heset down the empty glass.'Then there is such a person as Goldstein?' he said.'Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. Where, I do not know.''And the conspiracy--the organization? Is it real? It is not simply aninvention of the Thought Police?''No, it is real. The Brotherhood, we call it. You will never learn muchmore about the Brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it.I will come back to that presently.' He looked at his wrist-watch. 'It isunwise even for members of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen formore than half an hour. You ought not to have come here together, andyou will have to leave separately. You, comrade'--he bowed his head toJulia--'will leave first. We have about twenty minutes at our disposal.You will understand that I must start by asking you certain questions.In general terms, what are you prepared to do?''Anything that we are capable of,' said Winston.O'Brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facingWinston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming to take it for granted thatWinston could speak for her. For a moment the lids flitted down over hiseyes. He began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, asthough this were a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answerswere known to him already.'You are prepared to give your lives?''Yes.''You are prepared to commit murder?''Yes.''To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds ofinnocent people?''Yes.''To betray your country to foreign powers?''Yes.''You are prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to corrupt the mindsof children, to distribute habit-forming drugs, to encourage prostitution,to disseminate venereal diseases--to do anything which is likely to causedemoralization and weaken the power of the Party?''Yes.''If, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuricacid in a child's face--are you prepared to do that?''Yes.''You are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your lifeas a waiter or a dock-worker?''Yes.''You are prepared to commit suicide, if and when we order you to do so?''Yes.''You are prepared, the two of you, to separate and never see one anotheragain?''No!' broke in Julia.It appeared to Winston that a long time passed before he answered. For amoment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech. Histongue worked soundlessly, forming the opening syllables first of one word,then of the other, over and over again. Until he had said it, he did notknow which word he was going to say. 'No,' he said finally.'You did well to tell me,' said O'Brien. 'It is necessary for us to knoweverything.'He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice with somewhat moreexpression in it:'Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a differentperson? We may be obliged to give him a new identity. His face, hismovements, the shape of his hands, the colour of his hair--even his voicewould be different. And you yourself might have become a different person.Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. Sometimes it isnecessary. Sometimes we even amputate a limb.'Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martin'sMongolian face. There were no scars that he could see. Julia had turned ashade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced O'Brienboldly. She murmured something that seemed to be assent.'Good. Then that is settled.'There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a ratherabsent-minded air O'Brien pushed them towards the others, took one himself,then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could thinkbetter standing. They were very good cigarettes, very thick andwell-packed, with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. O'Brien looked athis wrist-watch again.'You had better go back to your Pantry, Martin,' he said. 'I shall switchon in a quarter of an hour. Take a good look at these comrades' facesbefore you go. You will be seeing them again. I may not.'Exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man's dark eyesflickered over their faces. There was not a trace of friendliness in hismanner. He was memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest inthem, or appeared to feel none. It occurred to Winston that a syntheticface was perhaps incapable of changing its expression. Without speakingor giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out, closing the doorsilently behind him. O'Brien was strolling up and down, one hand in thepocket of his black overalls, the other holding his cigarette.'You understand,' he said, 'that you will be fighting in the dark. Youwill always be in the dark. You will receive orders and you will obey them,without knowing why. Later I shall send you a book from which you willlearn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by whichwe shall destroy it. When you have read the book, you will be full membersof the Brotherhood. But between the general aims that we are fighting forand the immediate tasks of the moment, you will never know anything. Itell you that the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether itnumbers a hundred members, or ten million. From your personal knowledgeyou will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen. Youwill have three or four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time asthey disappear. As this was your first contact, it will be preserved. Whenyou receive orders, they will come from me. If we find it necessary tocommunicate with you, it will be through Martin. When you are finallycaught, you will confess. That is unavoidable. But you will have verylittle to confess, other than your own actions. You will not be able tobetray more than a handful of unimportant people. Probably you will noteven betray me. By that time I may be dead, or I shall have become adifferent person, with a different face.'He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. In spite of thebulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements. Itcame out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket,or manipulated a cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave animpression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. Howevermuch in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness thatbelongs to a fanatic. When he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease,amputated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air of persiflage.'This is unavoidable,' his voice seemed to say; 'this is what we have gotto do, unflinchingly. But this is not what we shall be doing when life isworth living again.' A wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed outfrom Winston towards O'Brien. For the moment he had forgotten the shadowyfigure of Goldstein. When you looked at O'Brien's powerful shoulders andhis blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossibleto believe that he could be defeated. There was no stratagem that he wasnot equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia seemed tobe impressed. She had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently.O'Brien went on:'You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood. No doubtyou have formed your own picture of it. You have imagined, probably, ahuge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribblingmessages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by specialmovements of the hand. Nothing of the kind exists. The members of theBrotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossiblefor any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others.Goldstein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police, couldnot give them a complete list of members, or any information that wouldlead them to a complete list. No such list exists. The Brotherhood cannotbe wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense.Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible. Youwill never have anything to sustain you, except the idea. You will get nocomradeship and no encouragement. When finally you are caught, you willget no help. We never help our members. At most, when it is absolutelynecessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally able tosmuggle a razor blade into a prisoner's cell. You will have to get usedto living without results and without hope. You will work for a while,you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. Those arethe only results that you will ever see. There is no possibility that anyperceptible change will happen within our own lifetime. We are the dead.Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfulsof dust and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, thereis no knowing. It might be a thousand years. At present nothing is possibleexcept to extend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot actcollectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual toindividual, generation after generation. In the face of the Thought Policethere is no other way.'He halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch.'It is almost time for you to leave, comrade,' he said to Julia. 'Wait.The decanter is still half full.'He filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem.'What shall it be this time?' he said, still with the same faintsuggestion of irony. 'To the confusion of the Thought Police? To thedeath of Big Brother? To humanity? To the future?''To the past,' said Winston.'The past is more important,' agreed O'Brien gravely.They emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia stood up to go.O'Brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flatwhite tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. It was important,he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were veryobservant. As soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forgether existence. He took another pace or two up and down, then stopped.'There are details to be settled,' he said. 'I assume that you have ahiding-place of some kind?'Winston explained about the room over Mr Charrington's shop.'That will do for the moment. Later we will arrange something else for you.It is important to change one's hiding-place frequently. Meanwhile I shallsend you a copy of THE BOOK'--even O'Brien, Winston noticed, seemed topronounce the words as though they were in italics--'Goldstein's book, youunderstand, as soon as possible. It may be some days before I can get holdof one. There are not many in existence, as you can imagine. The ThoughtPolice hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can producethem. It makes very little difference. The book is indestructible. Ifthe last copy were gone, we could reproduce it almost word for word. Doyou carry a brief-case to work with you?' he added.'As a rule, yes.''What is it like?''Black, very shabby. With two straps.''Black, two straps, very shabby--good. One day in the fairly nearfuture--I cannot give a date--one of the messages among your morning'swork will contain a misprinted word, and you will have to ask for arepeat. On the following day you will go to work without your brief-case.At some time during the day, in the street, a man will touch you on thearm and say "I think you have dropped your brief-case." The one he givesyou will contain a copy of Goldstein's book. You will return it withinfourteen days.'They were silent for a moment.'There are a couple of minutes before you need go,' said O'Brien. 'Weshall meet again--if we do meet again----'Winston looked up at him. 'In the place where there is no darkness?'he said hesitantly.O'Brien nodded without appearance of surprise. 'In the place where thereis no darkness,' he said, as though he had recognized the allusion. 'Andin the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave?Any message? Any question?.'Winston thought. There did not seem to be any further question that hewanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-soundinggeneralities. Instead of anything directly connected with O'Brien or theBrotherhood, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of thedark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and the little roomover Mr Charrington's shop, and the glass paperweight, and the steelengraving in its rosewood frame. Almost at random he said:'Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins "Oranges and lemons,say the bells of St Clement's"?'Again O'Brien nodded. With a sort of grave courtesy he completed thestanza:  'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,  You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,  When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey,  When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch.''You knew the last line!' said Winston.'Yes, I knew the last line. And now, I am afraid, it is time for you to go.But wait. You had better let me give you one of these tablets.'As Winston stood up O'Brien held out a hand. His powerful grip crushedthe bones of Winston's palm. At the door Winston looked back, but O'Brienseemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind. He was waitingwith his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen. Beyond himWinston could see the writing-table with its green-shaded lamp and thespeakwrite and the wire baskets deep-laden with papers. The incident wasclosed. Within thirty seconds, it occurred to him, O'Brien would be backat his interrupted and important work on behalf of the Party.Chapter 9Winston was gelatinous with fatigue. Gelatinous was the right word. It hadcome into his head spontaneously. His body seemed to have not only theweakness of a jelly, but its translucency. He felt that if he held up hishand he would be able to see the light through it. All the blood andlymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leavingonly a frail structure of nerves, bones, and skin. All sensations seemedto be magnified. His overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickledhis feet, even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that madehis joints creak.He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So had everyone else inthe Ministry. Now it was all over, and he had literally nothing to do, noParty work of any description, until tomorrow morning. He could spend sixhours in the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, inmild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the directionof Mr Charrington's shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols, butirrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyoneinterfering with him. The heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumpedagainst his knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and downthe skin of his leg. Inside it was the book, which he had now had in hispossession for six days and had not yet opened, nor even looked at.On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the speeches, theshouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, the films, the waxworks,the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet,the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes,the booming of guns--after six days of this, when the great orgasm wasquivering to its climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled upinto such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the lastday of the proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them topieces--at just this moment it had been announced that Oceania was notafter all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Eurasiawas an ally.There was, of course, no admission that any change had taken place. Merelyit became known, with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once, thatEastasia and not Eurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in ademonstration in one of the central London squares at the moment when ithappened. It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners wereluridly floodlit. The square was packed with several thousand people,including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of theSpies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the Inner Party, a smalllean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull overwhich a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd. A littleRumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of themicrophone with one hand while the other, enormous at the end of a bonyarm, clawed the air menacingly above his head. His voice, made metallic bythe amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres,deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing ofcivilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties. It wasalmost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and thenmaddened. At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and thevoice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that roseuncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most savage yells of allcame from the schoolchildren. The speech had been proceeding for perhapstwenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap ofpaper was slipped into the speaker's hand. He unrolled and read it withoutpausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice or manner, or in thecontent of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different.Without words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd.Oceania was at war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendouscommotion. The banners and posters with which the square was decoratedwere all wrong! Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. It wassabotage! The agents of Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotousinterlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shredsand trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies of activity inclambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered fromthe chimneys. But within two or three minutes it was all over. The orator,still gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward,his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech.One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from thecrowd. The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target hadbeen changed.The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker hadswitched from one line to the other actually in midsentence, not onlywithout a pause, but without even breaking the syntax. But at the momenthe had other things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorderwhile the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did notsee had tapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Excuse me, I think you'vedropped your brief-case.' He took the brief-case abstractedly, withoutspeaking. He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity tolook inside it. The instant that the demonstration was over he wentstraight to the Ministry of Truth, though the time was now nearlytwenty-three hours. The entire staff of the Ministry had done likewise.The orders already issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to theirposts, were hardly necessary.Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war withEastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was nowcompletely obsolete. Reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books,pamphlets, films, sound-tracks, photographs--all had to be rectified atlightning speed. Although no directive was ever issued, it was known thatthe chiefs of the Department intended that within one week no referenceto the war with Eurasia, or the alliance with Eastasia, should remain inexistence anywhere. The work was overwhelming, all the more so becausethe processes that it involved could not be called by their truenames. Everyone in the Records Department worked eighteen hours in thetwenty-four, with two three-hour snatches of sleep. Mattresses were broughtup from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted ofsandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants fromthe canteen. Each time that Winston broke off for one of his spells ofsleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work, and each time that hecrawled back sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that another showerof paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift, half-burying thespeakwrite and overflowing on to the floor, so that the first job wasalways to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work.What was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical.Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another, but anydetailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even thegeographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from onepart of the world to another was considerable.By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wipingevery few minutes. It was like struggling with some crushing physical task,something which one had the right to refuse and which one was neverthelessneurotically anxious to accomplish. In so far as he had time to rememberit, he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into thespeakwrite, every stroke of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie. He wasas anxious as anyone else in the Department that the forgery should beperfect. On the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders sloweddown. For as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube; then onemore cylinder, then nothing. Everywhere at about the same time the workwas easing off. A deep and as it were secret sigh went through theDepartment. A mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, had beenachieved. It was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentaryevidence that the war with Eurasia had ever happened. At twelve hundred itwas unexpectedly announced that all workers in the Ministry were free tilltomorrow morning. Winston, still carrying the brief-case containing thebook, which had remained between his feet while he worked and under hisbody while he slept, went home, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep inhis bath, although the water was barely more than tepid.With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair aboveMr Charrington's shop. He was tired, but not sleepy any longer. He openedthe window, lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water forcoffee. Julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book. Hesat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case.A heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on thecover. The print also looked slightly irregular. The pages were worn atthe edges, and fell apart, easily, as though the book had passed throughmany hands. The inscription on the title-page ran:  THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF  OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM  by  Emmanuel GoldsteinWinston began reading:Chapter IIgnorance is StrengthThroughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age,there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle,and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have bornecountless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as theirattitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but theessential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormousupheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has alwaysreasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium,however far it is pushed one way or the other.The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable...Winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that hewas reading, in comfort and safety. He was alone: no telescreen, no ear atthe keyhole, no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover thepage with his hand. The sweet summer air played against his cheek. Fromsomewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children: in the roomitself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock. He settleddeeper into the arm-chair and put his feet up on the fender. It was bliss,it was eternity. Suddenly, as one sometimes does with a book of which oneknows that one will ultimately read and re-read every word, he opened itat a different place and found himself at Chapter III. He went on reading:Chapter IIIWar is PeaceThe splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an eventwhich could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentiethcentury. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empireby the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia andOceania, were already effectively in being. The third, Eastasia, onlyemerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. Thefrontiers between the three super-states are in some places arbitrary, andin others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in generalthey follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the whole of the northernpart of the European and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the BeringStrait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands including theBritish Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa. Eastasia,smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier,comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese islandsand a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently atwar, and have been so for the past twenty-five years. War, however, is nolonger the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the earlydecades of the twentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims betweencombatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material causefor fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference.This is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailingattitude towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous.On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries,and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reductionof whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners whichextend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal,and, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy,meritorious. But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers ofpeople, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively fewcasualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vaguefrontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or roundthe Floating Fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. Inthe centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortageof consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which maycause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact changed its character. Moreexactly, the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order ofimportance. Motives which were already present to some small extent in thegreat wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant andare consciously recognized and acted upon.To understand the nature of the present war--for in spite of the regroupingwhich occurs every few years, it is always the same war--one must realizein the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None ofthe three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the othertwo in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defencesare too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces, Oceaniaby the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundityand industriousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, ina material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment ofself-contained economies, in which production and consumption are gearedto one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause ofprevious wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materialsis no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the threesuper-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials thatit needs within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a directeconomic purpose, it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers ofthe super-states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them,there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville,Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the populationof the earth. It is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions,and of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are constantlystruggling. In practice no one power ever controls the whole of thedisputed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is thechance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treacherythat dictates the endless changes of alignment.All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some ofthem yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colderclimates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods.But above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whicheverpower controls equatorial Africa, or the countries of the Middle East, orSouthern India, or the Indonesian Archipelago, disposes also of the bodiesof scores or hundreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies.The inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the statusof slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror, and are expendedlike so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments, to capturemore territory, to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments,to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It should be noted thatthe fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas.The frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the Congoand the northern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the IndianOcean and the Pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured byOceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia the dividing line between Eurasia andEastasia is never stable; round the Pole all three powers lay claim toenormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored:but the balance of power always remains roughly even, and the territorywhich forms the heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate.Moreover, the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is notreally necessary to the world's economy. They add nothing to the wealth ofthe world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war, andthe object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in whichto wage another war. By their labour the slave populations allow the tempoof continuous warfare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist, thestructure of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself,would not be essentially different.The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles ofDOUBLETHINK, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized bythe directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of themachine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the endof the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus ofconsumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, whenfew human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously noturgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processesof destruction had been at work. The world of today is a bare, hungry,dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, andstill more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people ofthat period looked forward. In the early twentieth century, the vision ofa future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient--aglittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete--waspart of the consciousness of nearly every literate person. Science andtechnology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural toassume that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partlybecause of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars andrevolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended onthe empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictlyregimented society. As a whole the world is more primitive today than itwas fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced, and variousdevices, always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage,have been developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped,and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never beenfully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are stillthere. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance itwas clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, andtherefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If themachine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt,illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations.And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort ofautomatic process--by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossiblenot to distribute--the machine did raise the living standards of theaverage human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years atthe end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened thedestruction--indeed, in some sense was the destruction--of a hierarchicalsociety. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough toeat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possesseda motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the mostimportant form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it oncebecame general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, nodoubt, to imagine a society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personalpossessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while POWERremained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice sucha society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security wereenjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normallystupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think forthemselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or laterrealize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweepit away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on abasis of poverty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, assome thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed ofdoing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendencytowards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almostthe whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industriallybackward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated,directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals.Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty byrestricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent duringthe final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economyof many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation,capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population wereprevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this,too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflictedwere obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem washow to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the realwealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not bedistributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was bycontinuous warfare.The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives,but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces,or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea,materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable,and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war arenot actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way ofexpending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour thatwould build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped asobsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and withfurther enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principlethe war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that mightexist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needsof the population are always underestimated, with the result that there isa chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked onas an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groupssomewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcityincreases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies thedistinction between one group and another. By the standards of the earlytwentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere,laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoyhis large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, thebetter quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or threeservants, his private motor-car or helicopter--set him in a different worldfrom a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party havea similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call'the proles'. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where thepossession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth andpoverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, andtherefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small casteseem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, butaccomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it wouldbe quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by buildingtemples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or evenby producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. Butthis would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for ahierarchical society. What is concerned here is not the morale of masses,whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work,but the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member isexpected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrowlimits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorantfanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastictriumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentalityappropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war isactually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it doesnot matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed isthat a state of war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence whichthe Party requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in anatmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranksone goes, the more marked it becomes. It is precisely in the Inner Partythat war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest. In his capacityas an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Partyto know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may oftenbe aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening oris being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but suchknowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK. Meanwhileno Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief thatthe war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with Oceaniathe undisputed master of the entire world.All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as anarticle of faith. It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring moreand more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance ofpower, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The searchfor new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remainingactivities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find anyoutlet. In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, hasalmost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for 'Science'. Theempirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements ofthe past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles ofIngsoc. And even technological progress only happens when its products canin some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. In all the usefularts the world is either standing still or going backwards. The fields arecultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by machinery. Butin matters of vital importance--meaning, in effect, war and policeespionage--the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at leasttolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface ofthe earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independentthought. There are therefore two great problems which the Party isconcerned to solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what anotherhuman being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundredmillion people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand. Inso far as scientific research still continues, this is its subject matter.The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor,studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions,gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects ofdrugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist,physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches of his specialsubject as are relevant to the taking of life. In the vast laboratoriesof the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in theBrazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands ofthe Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some areconcerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others deviselarger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and moreand more impenetrable armour-plating; others search for new and deadliergases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantitiesas to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of diseasegerms immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive to producea vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine underthe water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship;others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's raysthrough lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space, orproducing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat atthe earth's centre.But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization, and noneof the three super-states ever gains a significant lead on the others.What is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in theatomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their presentresearches are likely to discover. Although the Party, according to itshabit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared asearly as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale aboutten years later. At that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped onindustrial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe, andNorth America. The effect was to convince the ruling groups of allcountries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organizedsociety, and hence of their own power. Thereafter, although no formalagreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All threepowers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up againstthe decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later.And meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty orforty years. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombingplanes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and thefragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable FloatingFortress; but otherwise there has been little development. The tank, thesubmarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the handgrenade are still in use. And in spite of the endless slaughters reportedin the Press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars,in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killedin a few weeks, have never been repeated.None of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre which involvesthe risk of serious defeat. When any large operation is undertaken, it isusually a surprise attack against an ally. The strategy that all threepowers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following,is the same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, andwell-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completelyencircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact offriendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many yearsas to lull suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded with atomicbombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will allbe fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliationimpossible. It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with theremaining world-power, in preparation for another attack. This scheme, itis hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization.Moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round theEquator and the Pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken.This explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between thesuper-states are arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer theBritish Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on the otherhand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhineor even to the Vistula. But this would violate the principle, followed onall sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania wereto conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany, itwould be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of greatphysical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundredmillion people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly onthe Oceanic level. The problem is the same for all three super-states.It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be nocontact with foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with war prisonersand coloured slaves. Even the official ally of the moment is alwaysregarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the averagecitizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia orEastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If hewere allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they arecreatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told aboutthem is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and thefear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends mightevaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia,or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers mustnever be crossed by anything except bombs.Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood andacted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-statesare very much the same. In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is calledIngsoc, in Eurasia it is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it iscalled by a Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but perhapsbetter rendered as Obliteration of the Self. The citizen of Oceania is notallowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, buthe is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality andcommon sense. Actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable,and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all.Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship ofsemi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuouswarfare. It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquerone another, but would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary,so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, like threesheaves of corn. And, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers aresimultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives arededicated to world conquest, but they also know that it is necessary thatthe war should continue everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile thefact that there IS no danger of conquest makes possible the denial ofreality which is the special feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems ofthought. Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, thatby becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character.In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner orlater came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat. In thepast, also, war was one of the main instruments by which human societieswere kept in touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have triedto impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they couldnot afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair militaryefficiency. So long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some otherresult generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeathad to be serious. Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, orreligion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but whenone was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four. Inefficientnations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle forefficiency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it wasnecessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairlyaccurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers and historybooks were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification ofthe kind that is practised today would have been impossible. War was asure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concernedit was probably the most important of all safeguards. While wars could bewon or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous.When war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity.Technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied ordisregarded. As we have seen, researches that could be called scientificare still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially akind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results is not important.Efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed. Nothing isefficient in Oceania except the Thought Police. Since each of the threesuper-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe withinwhich almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised. Realityonly exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life--the need toeat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison orstepping out of top-storey windows, and the like. Between life and death,and between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still adistinction, but that is all. Cut off from contact with the outer world,and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellarspace, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down.The rulers of such a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesarscould not be. They are obliged to prevent their followers from starvingto death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obligedto remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals; butonce that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shapethey choose.The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, ismerely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminantanimals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable ofhurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. Iteats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve thespecial mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. War, it willbe seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groupsof all countries, although they might recognize their common interest andtherefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another,and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they arenot fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each rulinggroup against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to makeor prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of societyintact. The very word 'war', therefore, has become misleading. It wouldprobably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased toexist. The peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between theNeolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and beenreplaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the sameif the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agreeto live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. Forin that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for everfrom the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was trulypermanent would be the same as a permanent war. This--although the vastmajority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense--is theinner meaning of the Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in remote distance arocket bomb thundered. The blissful feeling of being alone with theforbidden book, in a room with no telescreen, had not worn off. Solitudeand safety were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tirednessof his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint breeze fromthe window that played upon his cheek. The book fascinated him, or moreexactly it reassured him. In a sense it told him nothing that was new, butthat was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if ithad been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It wasthe product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful,more systematic, less fear-ridden. The best books, he perceived, are thosethat tell you what you know already. He had just turned back to Chapter Iwhen he heard Julia's footstep on the stair and started out of his chairto meet her. She dumped her brown tool-bag on the floor and flung herselfinto his arms. It was more than a week since they had seen one another.'I've got THE BOOK,' he said as they disentangled themselves.'Oh, you've got it? Good,' she said without much interest, and almostimmediately knelt down beside the oil stove to make the coffee.They did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half anhour. The evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull upthe counterpane. From below came the familiar sound of singing and thescrape of boots on the flagstones. The brawny red-armed woman whom Winstonhad seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard. Thereseemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and frobetween the washtub and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothespegs and breaking forth into lusty song. Julia had settled down on herside and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep. He reachedout for the book, which was lying on the floor, and sat up against thebedhead.'We must read it,' he said. 'You too. All members of the Brotherhood haveto read it.''You read it,' she said with her eyes shut. 'Read it aloud. That's thebest way. Then you can explain it to me as you go.'The clock's hands said six, meaning eighteen. They had three or four hoursahead of them. He propped the book against his knees and began reading:Chapter IIgnorance is StrengthThroughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age,there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle,and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have bornecountless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as theirattitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but theessential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormousupheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has alwaysreasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium,however far it is pushed one way or the other'Julia, are you awake?' said Winston.'Yes, my love, I'm listening. Go on. It's marvellous.'He continued reading:The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim ofthe High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to changeplaces with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim--for itis an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushedby drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outsidetheir daily lives--is to abolish all distinctions and create a society inwhich all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which isthe same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periodsthe High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there alwayscomes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or theircapacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by theMiddle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that theyare fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached theirobjective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position ofservitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle groupsplits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and thestruggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are nevereven temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be anexaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress ofa material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average humanbeing is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But noadvance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution hasever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view ofthe Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in thename of their masters.By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had becomeobvious to many observers. There then rose schools of thinkers whointerpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show thatinequality was the unalterable law of human life. This doctrine, of course,had always had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was now putforward there was a significant change. In the past the need for ahierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of theHigh. It had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests,lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had generallybeen softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond thegrave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling for power, had always madeuse of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity. Now, however, theconcept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were notyet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long. In thepast the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, andthen had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown.The new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand.Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and wasthe last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellionsof antiquity, was still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages.But in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards theaim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openlyabandoned. The new movements which appeared in the middle years of thecentury, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, asit is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim of perpetuatingUNfreedom and INequality. These new movements, of course, grew out of theold ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to theirideology. But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freezehistory at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulum swing was to happen oncemore, and then stop. As usual, the High were to be turned out by theMiddle, who would then become the High; but this time, by consciousstrategy, the High would be able to maintain their position permanently.The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historicalknowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which had hardly existedbefore the nineteenth century. The cyclical movement of history was nowintelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then itwas alterable. But the principal, underlying cause was that, as earlyas the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had becometechnically possible. It was still true that men were not equal in theirnative talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways thatfavoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any realneed for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. In earlierages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable.Inequality was the price of civilization. With the development of machineproduction, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessaryfor human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessaryfor them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore, fromthe point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power,human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger tobe averted. In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society wasin fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. The idea ofan earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state ofbrotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the humanimagination for thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain holdeven on the groups who actually profited by each historical change. Theheirs of the French, English, and American revolutions had partly believedin their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equalitybefore the law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to beinfluenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth decade of thetwentieth century all the main currents of political thought wereauthoritarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly themoment when it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatevername it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in thegeneral hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices whichhad been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years--imprisonmentwithout trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions,torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportationof whole populations--not only became common again, but were toleratedand even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened andprogressive.It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, andcounter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivalsemerged as fully worked-out political theories. But they had beenforeshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, whichhad appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the worldwhich would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious. Whatkind of people would control this world had been equally obvious. The newaristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists,technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists,teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These people, whoseorigins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of theworking class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world ofmonopoly industry and centralized government. As compared with theiropposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted byluxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of whatthey were doing and more intent on crushing opposition. This lastdifference was cardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all thetyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. The ruling groupswere always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content toleave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to beuninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Churchof the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reasonfor this was that in the past no government had the power to keep itscitizens under constant surveillance. The invention of print, however,made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radiocarried the process further. With the development of television, andthe technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmitsimultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. Everycitizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching,could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the policeand in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels ofcommunication closed. The possibility of enforcing not only completeobedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinionon all subjects, now existed for the first time.After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, societyregrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the new Highgroup, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew whatwas needed to safeguard its position. It had long been realized that theonly secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilegeare most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The so-called'abolition of private property' which took place in the middle years ofthe century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewerhands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners were agroup instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of theParty owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, theParty owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, anddisposes of the products as it thinks fit. In the years following theRevolution it was able to step into this commanding position almostunopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act ofcollectivization. It had always been assumed that if the capitalist classwere expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably thecapitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses,transport--everything had been taken away from them: and since thesethings were no longer private property, it followed that they must bepublic property. Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier Socialist movementand inherited its phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item inthe Socialist programme; with the result, foreseen and intended beforehand,that economic inequality has been made permanent.But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper thanthis. There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power.Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently thatthe masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontentedMiddle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence andwillingness to govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a ruleall four of them are present in some degree. A ruling class which couldguard against all of them would remain in power permanently. Ultimatelythe determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself.After the middle of the present century, the first danger had in realitydisappeared. Each of the three powers which now divide the world is infact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slowdemographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert.The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one. The masses neverrevolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they areoppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards ofcomparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed. Therecurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and arenot now permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocationscan and do happen without having political results, because there is noway in which discontent can become articulate. As for the problem ofover-production, which has been latent in our society since the developmentof machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous warfare(see Chapter III), which is also useful in keying up public morale to thenecessary pitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore,the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able,under-employed, power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism andscepticism in their own ranks. The problem, that is to say, is educational.It is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of thedirecting group and of the larger executive group that lies immediatelybelow it. The consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced ina negative way.Given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already,the general structure of Oceanic society. At the apex of the pyramid comesBig Brother. Big Brother is infallible and all-powerful. Every success,every achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, allknowledge, all wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issuedirectly from his leadership and inspiration. Nobody has ever seen BigBrother. He is a face on the hoardings, a voice on the telescreen. Wemay be reasonably sure that he will never die, and there is alreadyconsiderable uncertainty as to when he was born. Big Brother is the guisein which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world. His function isto act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions whichare more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization.Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party. Its numbers limited to sixmillions, or something less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania.Below the Inner Party comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party isdescribed as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to the hands.Below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as 'theproles', numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the population. In the termsof our earlier classification, the proles are the Low: for the slavepopulation of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conquerorto conqueror, are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure.In principle, membership of these three groups is not hereditary. Thechild of Inner Party parents is in theory not born into the Inner Party.Admission to either branch of the Party is by examination, taken at theage of sixteen. Nor is there any racial discrimination, or any markeddomination of one province by another. Jews, Negroes, South Americans ofpure Indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the Party, andthe administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants ofthat area. In no part of Oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling thatthey are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital. Oceania hasno capital, and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobodyknows. Except that English is its chief LINGUA FRANCA and Newspeak itsofficial language, it is not centralized in any way. Its rulers are notheld together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. It istrue that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on whatat first sight appear to be hereditary lines. There is far less to-and-fromovement between the different groups than happened under capitalism oreven in the pre-industrial age. Between the two branches of the Partythere is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much as will ensurethat weaklings are excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitiousmembers of the Outer Party are made harmless by allowing them to rise.Proletarians, in practice, are not allowed to graduate into the Party. Themost gifted among them, who might possibly become nuclei of discontent,are simply marked down by the Thought Police and eliminated. But thisstate of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a matter ofprinciple. The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It doesnot aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if therewere no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would beperfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks ofthe proletariat. In the crucial years, the fact that the Party was not ahereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition. The older kindof Socialist, who had been trained to fight against something called'class privilege' assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent.He did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical,nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always beenshortlived, whereas adoptive organizations such as the Catholic Churchhave sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years. The essence ofoligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the persistence ofa certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead uponthe living. A ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominateits successors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood butwith perpetuating itself. WHO wields power is not important, provided thatthe hierarchical structure remains always the same.All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes thatcharacterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique ofthe Party and prevent the true nature of present-day society from beingperceived. Physical rebellion, or any preliminary move towards rebellion,is at present not possible. From the proletarians nothing is to be feared.Left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation andfrom century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only withoutany impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the worldcould be other than it is. They could only become dangerous if the advanceof industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly;but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, thelevel of popular education is actually declining. What opinions the masseshold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. They canbe granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect. In a Partymember, on the other hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion onthe most unimportant subject can be tolerated.A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the ThoughtPolice. Even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone.Wherever he may be, asleep or awake, working or resting, in his bath or inbed, he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he isbeing inspected. Nothing that he does is indifferent. His friendships, hisrelaxations, his behaviour towards his wife and children, the expressionof his face when he is alone, the words he mutters in sleep, even thecharacteristic movements of his body, are all jealously scrutinized. Notonly any actual misdemeanour, but any eccentricity, however small, anychange of habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptomof an inner struggle, is certain to be detected. He has no freedom ofchoice in any direction whatever. On the other hand his actions are notregulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour. In Oceaniathere is no law. Thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean certaindeath are not formally forbidden, and the endless purges, arrests,tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishmentfor crimes which have actually been committed, but are merely thewiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in thefuture. A Party member is required to have not only the right opinions,but the right instincts. Many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of himare never plainly stated, and could not be stated without laying bare thecontradictions inherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox(in Newspeak a GOODTHINKER), he will in all circumstances know, withouttaking thought, what is the true belief or the desirable emotion. But inany case an elaborate mental training, undergone in childhood and groupingitself round the Newspeak words CRIMESTOP, BLACKWHITE, and DOUBLETHINK,makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever.A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respitesfrom enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatredof foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, andself-abasement before the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontentsproduced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwardsand dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes Hate, and thespeculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitudeare killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline. The firstand simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even to youngchildren, is called, in Newspeak, CRIMESTOP. CRIMESTOP means the facultyof stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerousthought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing toperceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments ifthey are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any trainof thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. CRIMESTOP,in short, means protective stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On thecontrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one's ownmental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body.Oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother isomnipotent and that the Party is infallible. But since in reality BigBrother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is needfor an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts.The keyword here is BLACKWHITE. Like so many Newspeak words, this word hastwo mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means thehabit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of theplain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness tosay that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it meansalso the ability to BELIEVE that black is white, and more, to KNOW thatblack is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary.This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by thesystem of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is knownin Newspeak as DOUBLETHINK.The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which issubsidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. The subsidiary reason is thatthe Party member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditionspartly because he has no standards of comparison. He must be cut off fromthe past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it isnecessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors andthat the average level of material comfort is constantly rising. But byfar the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is theneed to safeguard the infallibility of the Party. It is not merely thatspeeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly broughtup to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were inall cases right. It is also that no change in doctrine or in politicalalignment can ever be admitted. For to change one's mind, or even one'spolicy, is a confession of weakness. If, for example, Eurasia or Eastasia(whichever it may be) is the enemy today, then that country must alwayshave been the enemy. And if the facts say otherwise then the facts mustbe altered. Thus history is continuously rewritten. This day-to-dayfalsification of the past, carried out by the Ministry of Truth, is asnecessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression andespionage carried out by the Ministry of Love.The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. Past events,it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in writtenrecords and in human memories. The past is whatever the records and thememories agree upon. And since the Party is in full control of all recordsand in equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows thatthe past is whatever the Party chooses to make it. It also follows thatthough the past is alterable, it never has been altered in any specificinstance. For when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed atthe moment, then this new version IS the past, and no different past canever have existed. This holds good even when, as often happens, the sameevent has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course ofa year. At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth, andclearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now.It will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on thetraining of memory. To make sure that all written records agree withthe orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act. But it is alsonecessary to REMEMBER that events happened in the desired manner. And ifit is necessary to rearrange one's memories or to tamper with writtenrecords, then it is necessary to FORGET that one has done so. The trick ofdoing this can be learned like any other mental technique. It is learnedby the majority of Party members, and certainly by all who are intelligentas well as orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, 'realitycontrol'. In Newspeak it is called DOUBLETHINK, though DOUBLETHINKcomprises much else as well.DOUBLETHINK means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one'smind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. The Party intellectualknows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knowsthat he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of DOUBLETHINKhe also satisfies himself that reality is not violated. The process has tobe conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision,but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling offalsity and hence of guilt. DOUBLETHINK lies at the very heart of Ingsoc,since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious deception whileretaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To telldeliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact thathas become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, todraw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny theexistence of objective reality and all the while to take account of thereality which one denies--all this is indispensably necessary. Even inusing the word DOUBLETHINK it is necessary to exercise DOUBLETHINK. Forby using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by afresh act of DOUBLETHINK one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely,with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by meansof DOUBLETHINK that the Party has been able--and may, for all we know,continue to be able for thousands of years--to arrest the course ofhistory.All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossifiedor because they grew soft. Either they became stupid and arrogant, failedto adjust themselves to changing circumstances, and were overthrown; orthey became liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should haveused force, and once again were overthrown. They fell, that is to say,either through consciousness or through unconsciousness. It is theachievement of the Party to have produced a system of thought in whichboth conditions can exist simultaneously. And upon no other intellectualbasis could the dominion of the Party be made permanent. If one is to rule,and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality.For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one's owninfallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes.It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of DOUBLETHINK arethose who invented DOUBLETHINK and know that it is a vast system of mentalcheating. In our society, those who have the best knowledge of what ishappening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is.In general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delusion; themore intelligent, the less sane. One clear illustration of this is thefact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the socialscale. Those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly rational arethe subject peoples of the disputed territories. To these people the waris simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodieslike a tidal wave. Which side is winning is a matter of completeindifference to them. They are aware that a change of overlordship meanssimply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters whotreat them in the same manner as the old ones. The slightly more favouredworkers whom we call 'the proles' are only intermittently conscious of thewar. When it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear andhatred, but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting forlong periods that the war is happening. It is in the ranks of the Party,and above all of the Inner Party, that the true war enthusiasm is found.World-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to beimpossible. This peculiar linking-together of opposites--knowledge withignorance, cynicism with fanaticism--is one of the chief distinguishingmarks of Oceanic society. The official ideology abounds with contradictionseven when there is no practical reason for them. Thus, the Party rejectsand vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement originallystood, and it chooses to do this in the name of Socialism. It preachesa contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past, and itdresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manualworkers and was adopted for that reason. It systematically undermines thesolidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is adirect appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty. Even the names of thefour Ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence intheir deliberate reversal of the facts. The Ministry of Peace concernsitself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Lovewith torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. Thesecontradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinaryhypocrisy; they are deliberate exercises in DOUBLETHINK. For it is onlyby reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely.In no other way could the ancient cycle be broken. If human equality isto be for ever averted--if the High, as we have called them, are to keeptheir places permanently--then the prevailing mental condition must becontrolled insanity.But there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored.It is; WHY should human equality be averted? Supposing that the mechanicsof the process have been rightly described, what is the motive for thishuge, accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular momentof time?Here we reach the central secret. As we have seen. the mystique of theParty, and above all of the Inner Party, depends upon DOUBLETHINK Butdeeper than this lies the original motive, the never-questioned instinctthat first led to the seizure of power and brought DOUBLETHINK, theThought Police, continuous warfare, and all the other necessaryparaphernalia into existence afterwards. This motive really consists...Winston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware of a new sound. Itseemed to him that Julia had been very still for some time past. She waslying on her side, naked from the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowedon her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. Her breast roseand fell slowly and regularly.'Julia.'No answer.'Julia, are you awake?'No answer. She was asleep. He shut the book, put it carefully on the floor,lay down, and pulled the coverlet over both of them.He had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret. He understoodHOW; he did not understand WHY. Chapter I, like Chapter III, had notactually told him anything that he did not know, it had merely systematizedthe knowledge that he possessed already. But after reading it he knewbetter than before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, even aminority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there wasuntruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, youwere not mad. A yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through thewindow and fell across the pillow. He shut his eyes. The sun on his faceand the girl's smooth body touching his own gave him a strong, sleepy,confident feeling. He was safe, everything was all right. He fell asleepmurmuring 'Sanity is not statistical,' with the feeling that this remarkcontained in it a profound wisdom.*****When he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time,but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him that it was onlytwenty-thirty. He lay dozing for a while; then the usual deep-lungedsinging struck up from the yard below:  'It was only an 'opeless fancy,  It passed like an Ipril dye,  But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred  They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!'The drivelling song seemed to have kept its popularity. You still heard itall over the place. It had outlived the Hate Song. Julia woke at thesound, stretched herself luxuriously, and got out of bed.'I'm hungry,' she said. 'Let's make some more coffee. Damn! The stove'sgone out and the water's cold.' She picked the stove up and shook it.'There's no oil in it.''We can get some from old Charrington, I expect.''The funny thing is I made sure it was full. I'm going to put my clotheson,' she added. 'It seems to have got colder.'Winston also got up and dressed himself. The indefatigable voice sang on:  'They sye that time 'eals all things,  They sye you can always forget;  But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years  They twist my 'eart-strings yet!'As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window.The sun must have gone down behind the houses; it was not shining into theyard any longer. The flagstones were wet as though they had just beenwashed, and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so freshand pale was the blue between the chimney-pots. Tirelessly the womanmarched to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and fallingsilent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. He wonderedwhether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twentyor thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side; together theygazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below. As helooked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms reachingup for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck himfor the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before occurred tohim that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions bychildbearing, then hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in thegrain like an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, andafter all, he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a blockof granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the bodyof a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why should the fruit be heldinferior to the flower?'She's beautiful,' he murmured.'She's a metre across the hips, easily,' said Julia.'That is her style of beauty,' said Winston.He held Julia's supple waist easily encircled by his arm. From the hip tothe knee her flank was against his. Out of their bodies no child wouldever come. That was the one thing they could never do. Only by word ofmouth, from mind to mind, could they pass on the secret. The woman downthere had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm heart, and a fertilebelly. He wondered how many children she had given birth to. It mighteasily be fifteen. She had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps,of wild-rose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilizedfruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life had beenlaundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending,scrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grandchildren, overthirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still singing. The mysticalreverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect ofthe pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind the chimney-pots intointerminable distance. It was curious to think that the sky was the samefor everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the peopleunder the sky were also very much the same--everywhere, all over the world,hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorantof one another's existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, andyet almost exactly the same--people who had never learned to think but whowere storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power thatwould one day overturn the world. If there was hope, it lay in the proles!Without having read to the end of THE BOOK, he knew that that must beGoldstein's final message. The future belonged to the proles. And could hebe sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not bejust as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the Party? Yes,because at the least it would be a world of sanity. Where there isequality there can be sanity. Sooner or later it would happen, strengthwould change into consciousness. The proles were immortal, you could notdoubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the endtheir awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be athousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds,passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not shareand could not kill.'Do you remember,' he said, 'the thrush that sang to us, that first day,at the edge of the wood?''He wasn't singing to us,' said Julia. 'He was singing to please himself.Not even that. He was just singing.'The birds sang, the proles sang. the Party did not sing. All round theworld, in London and New York, in Africa and Brazil, and in the mysterious,forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin,in the villages of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China andJapan--everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure, made monstrousby work and childbearing, toiling from birth to death and still singing.Out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come.You were the dead, theirs was the future. But you could share in thatfuture if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body, and passedon the secret doctrine that two plus two make four.'We are the dead,' he said.'We are the dead,' echoed Julia dutifully.'You are the dead,' said an iron voice behind them.They sprang apart. Winston's entrails seemed to have turned into ice. Hecould see the white all round the irises of Julia's eyes. Her face hadturned a milky yellow. The smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbonestood out sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.'You are the dead,' repeated the iron voice.'It was behind the picture,' breathed Julia.'It was behind the picture,' said the voice. 'Remain exactly where youare. Make no movement until you are ordered.'It was starting, it was starting at last! They could do nothing exceptstand gazing into one another's eyes. To run for life, to get out of thehouse before it was too late--no such thought occurred to them. Unthinkableto disobey the iron voice from the wall. There was a snap as though a catchhad been turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. The picture had fallento the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it.'Now they can see us,' said Julia.'Now we can see you,' said the voice. 'Stand out in the middle of theroom. Stand back to back. Clasp your hands behind your heads. Do not touchone another.'They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel Julia'sbody shaking. Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own. He couldjust stop his teeth from chattering, but his knees were beyond his control.There was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside.The yard seemed to be full of men. Something was being dragged across thestones. The woman's singing had stopped abruptly. There was a long, rollingclang, as though the washtub had been flung across the yard, and then aconfusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.'The house is surrounded,' said Winston.'The house is surrounded,' said the voice.He heard Julia snap her teeth together. 'I suppose we may as well saygood-bye,' she said.'You may as well say good-bye,' said the voice. And then another quitedifferent voice, a thin, cultivated voice which Winston had the impressionof having heard before, struck in; 'And by the way, while we are on thesubject, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper tochop off your head"!'Something crashed on to the bed behind Winston's back. The head of a ladderhad been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame. Someone wasclimbing through the window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs.The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots ontheir feet and truncheons in their hands.Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he barely moved. Onething alone mattered; to keep still, to keep still and not give them anexcuse to hit you! A man with a smooth prize-fighter's jowl in which themouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheonmeditatively between thumb and forefinger. Winston met his eyes. Thefeeling of nakedness, with one's hands behind one's head and one's faceand body all exposed, was almost unbearable. The man protruded the tipof a white tongue, licked the place where his lips should have been, andthen passed on. There was another crash. Someone had picked up the glasspaperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearth-stone.The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud froma cake, rolled across the mat. How small, thought Winston, how small italways was! There was a gasp and a thump behind him, and he received aviolent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One ofthe men had smashed his fist into Julia's solar plexus, doubling her uplike a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the floor, fighting forbreath. Winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre, but sometimesher livid, gasping face came within the angle of his vision. Even in histerror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadlypain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back herbreath. He knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which wasthere all the while but could not be suffered yet, because before all elseit was necessary to be able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted herup by knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a sack.Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, withthe eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and thatwas the last he saw of her.He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts which came of theirown accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through hismind. He wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington. He wondered whatthey had done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly wantedto urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two orthree hours ago. He noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine,meaning twenty-one. But the light seemed too strong. Would not the lightbe fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening? He wondered whetherafter all he and Julia had mistaken the time--had slept the clock roundand thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirtyon the following morning. But he did not pursue the thought further.It was not interesting.There was another, lighter step in the passage. Mr Charrington came intothe room. The demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became moresubdued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington's appearance. Hiseye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.'Pick up those pieces,' he said sharply.A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disappeared; Winston suddenlyrealized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on thetelescreen. Mr Charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, buthis hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was notwearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp glance, as thoughverifying his identity, and then paid no more attention to him. He wasstill recognizable, but he was not the same person any longer. His bodyhad straightened, and seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergoneonly tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation.The black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the wholelines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. Itwas the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It occurred toWinston that for the first time in his life he was looking, with knowledge,at a member of the Thought Police.PART THREEChapter 1He did not know where he was. Presumably he was in the Ministry of Love,but there was no way of making certain. He was in a high-ceilingedwindowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lampsflooded it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming soundwhich he supposed had something to do with the air supply. A bench, orshelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken only by thedoor and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no woodenseat. There were four telescreens, one in each wall.There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever since theyhad bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. But he was alsohungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-fourhours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know,probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening whenthey arrested him. Since he was arrested he had not been fed.He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossedon his knee. He had already learned to sit still. If you made unexpectedmovements they yelled at you from the telescreen. But the craving for foodwas growing upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread.He had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of hisoveralls. It was even possible--he thought this because from time to timesomething seemed to tickle his leg--that there might be a sizeable bit ofcrust there. In the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear; heslipped a hand into his pocket.'Smith!' yelled a voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.! Hands out ofpockets in the cells!'He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Before being broughthere he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinaryprison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols. He did not know howlong he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and nodaylight it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smellingplace. They had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in,but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people. Themajority of them were common criminals, but there were a few politicalprisoners among them. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirtybodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take muchinterest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing differencein demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others. The Partyprisoners were always silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminalsseemed to care nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards,fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscenewords on the floor, ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterioushiding-places in their clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen whenit tried to restore order. On the other hand some of them seemed to be ongood terms with the guards, called them by nicknames, and tried to wheedlecigarettes through the spyhole in the door. The guards, too, treated thecommon criminals with a certain forbearance, even when they had to handlethem roughly. There was much talk about the forced-labour camps to whichmost of the prisoners expected to be sent. It was 'all right' in thecamps, he gathered, so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes.There was bribery, favouritism, and racketeering of every kind, there washomosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit alcohol distilledfrom potatoes. The positions of trust were given only to the commoncriminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sortof aristocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every description:drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers, drunks, prostitutes.Some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combineto suppress them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, withgreat tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come downin her struggles, was carried in, kicking and shouting, by four guards,who had hold of her one at each corner. They wrenched off the boots withwhich she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down acrossWinston's lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones. The woman hoisted herselfupright and followed them out with a yell of 'F---- bastards!' Then,noticing that she was sitting on something uneven, she slid off Winston'sknees on to the bench.'Beg pardon, dearie,' she said. 'I wouldn't 'a sat on you, only the buggersput me there. They dono 'ow to treat a lady, do they?' She paused, pattedher breast, and belched. 'Pardon,' she said, 'I ain't meself, quite.'She leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor.'Thass better,' she said, leaning back with closed eyes. 'Never keep itdown, thass what I say. Get it up while it's fresh on your stomach, like.'She revived, turned to have another look at Winston and seemed immediatelyto take a fancy to him. She put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew himtowards her, breathing beer and vomit into his face.'Wass your name, dearie?' she said.'Smith,' said Winston.'Smith?' said the woman. 'Thass funny. My name's Smith too. Why,' sheadded sentimentally, 'I might be your mother!'She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was about the right age andphysique, and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twentyyears in a forced-labour camp.No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent the ordinarycriminals ignored the Party prisoners. 'The polITS,' they called them,with a sort of uninterested contempt. The Party prisoners seemed terrifiedof speaking to anybody, and above all of speaking to one another. Onlyonce, when two Party members, both women, were pressed close together onthe bench, he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedly-whisperedwords; and in particular a reference to something called 'room one-oh-one',which he did not understand.It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here. Thedull pain in his belly never went away, but sometimes it grew better andsometimes worse, and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. Whenit grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire forfood. When it grew better, panic took hold of him. There were momentswhen he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actualitythat his heart galloped and his breath stopped. He felt the smash oftruncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himselfgrovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken teeth. Hehardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his mind on her. He loved herand would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew therules of arithmetic. He felt no love for her, and he hardly even wonderedwhat was happening to her. He thought oftener of O'Brien, with a flickeringhope. O'Brien might know that he had been arrested. The Brotherhood, hehad said, never tried to save its members. But there was the razor blade;they would send the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps fiveseconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The blade would biteinto him with a sort of burning coldness, and even the fingers that heldit would be cut to the bone. Everything came back to his sick body, whichshrank trembling from the smallest pain. He was not certain that he woulduse the razor blade even if he got the chance. It was more natural to existfrom moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes' life even with thecertainty that there was torture at the end of it.Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in thewalls of the cell. It should have been easy, but he always lost count atsome point or another. More often he wondered where he was, and what timeof day it was. At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylightoutside, and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. Inthis place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out.It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why O'Brien had seemed torecognize the allusion. In the Ministry of Love there were no windows. Hiscell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; itmight be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved himselfmentally from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of hisbody whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground.There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel door opened witha clang. A young officer, a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed toglitter all over with polished leather, and whose pale, straight-featuredface was like a wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motionedto the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. Thepoet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. The door clanged shut again.Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side, asthough having some idea that there was another door to go out of, and thenbegan to wander up and down the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston'spresence. His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre abovethe level of Winston's head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes weresticking out of the holes in his socks. He was also several days awayfrom a shave. A scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones, givinghim an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame andnervous movements.Winston roused himself a little from his lethargy. He must speakto Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen. It was evenconceivable that Ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade.'Ampleforth,' he said.There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth paused, mildly startled.His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.'Ah, Smith!' he said. 'You too!''What are you in for?''To tell you the truth--' He sat down awkwardly on the bench oppositeWinston. 'There is only one offence, is there not?' he said.'And have you committed it?''Apparently I have.'He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment, asthough trying to remember something.'These things happen,' he began vaguely. 'I have been able to recall oneinstance--a possible instance. It was an indiscretion, undoubtedly. Wewere producing a definitive edition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed theword "God" to remain at the end of a line. I could not help it!' he addedalmost indignantly, raising his face to look at Winston. 'It was impossibleto change the line. The rhyme was "rod". Do you realize that there are onlytwelve rhymes to "rod" in the entire language? For days I had racked mybrains. There WAS no other rhyme.'The expression on his face changed. The annoyance passed out of it and fora moment he looked almost pleased. A sort of intellectual warmth, the joyof the pedant who has found out some useless fact, shone through the dirtand scrubby hair.'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said, 'that the whole history of Englishpoetry has been determined by the fact that the English language lacksrhymes?'No, that particular thought had never occurred to Winston. Nor, in thecircumstances, did it strike him as very important or interesting.'Do you know what time of day it is?' he said.Ampleforth looked startled again. 'I had hardly thought about it. Theyarrested me--it could be two days ago--perhaps three.' His eyes flittedround the walls, as though he half expected to find a window somewhere.'There is no difference between night and day in this place. I do not seehow one can calculate the time.'They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason,a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. Winston sat quietly, hishands crossed. Ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrowbench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round oneknee, then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to keep still.Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour--it was difficult to judge. Once morethere was a sound of boots outside. Winston's entrails contracted. Soon,very soon, perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots wouldmean that his own turn had come.The door opened. The cold-faced young officer stepped into the cell. Witha brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth.'Room 101,' he said.Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, his face vaguelyperturbed, but uncomprehending.What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Winston's belly hadrevived. His mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ballfalling again and again into the same series of slots. He had only sixthoughts. The pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and thescreaming; O'Brien; Julia; the razor blade. There was another spasm in hisentrails, the heavy boots were approaching. As the door opened, the waveof air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. Parsonswalked into the cell. He was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.'YOU here!' he said.Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was neither interest norsurprise, but only misery. He began walking jerkily up and down, evidentlyunable to keep still. Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it wasapparent that they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring look,as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in themiddle distance.'What are you in for?' said Winston.'Thoughtcrime!' said Parsons, almost blubbering. The tone of his voiceimplied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of increduloushorror that such a word could be applied to himself. He paused oppositeWinston and began eagerly appealing to him: 'You don't think they'll shootme, do you, old chap? They don't shoot you if you haven't actually doneanything--only thoughts, which you can't help? I know they give you a fairhearing. Oh, I trust them for that! They'll know my record, won't they?YOU know what kind of chap I was. Not a bad chap in my way. Not brainy, ofcourse, but keen. I tried to do my best for the Party, didn't I? I'll getoff with five years, don't you think? Or even ten years? A chap like mecould make himself pretty useful in a labour-camp. They wouldn't shoot mefor going off the rails just once?''Are you guilty?' said Winston.'Of course I'm guilty!' cried Parsons with a servile glance at thetelescreen. 'You don't think the Party would arrest an innocent man,do you?' His frog-like face grew calmer, and even took on a slightlysanctimonious expression. 'Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,'he said sententiously. 'It's insidious. It can get hold of you withoutyour even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my sleep! Yes,that's a fact. There I was, working away, trying to do my bit--never knewI had any bad stuff in my mind at all. And then I started talking in mysleep. Do you know what they heard me saying?'He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical reasons toutter an obscenity.'"Down with Big Brother!" Yes, I said that! Said it over and over again,it seems. Between you and me, old man, I'm glad they got me before it wentany further. Do you know what I'm going to say to them when I go up beforethe tribunal? "Thank you," I'm going to say, "thank you for saving mebefore it was too late."''Who denounced you?' said Winston.'It was my little daughter,' said Parsons with a sort of doleful pride.'She listened at the keyhole. Heard what I was saying, and nipped off tothe patrols the very next day. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?I don't bear her any grudge for it. In fact I'm proud of her. It shows Ibrought her up in the right spirit, anyway.'He made a few more jerky movements up and down, several times, casting alonging glance at the lavatory pan. Then he suddenly ripped down hisshorts.'Excuse me, old man,' he said. 'I can't help it. It's the waiting.'He plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan. Winston covered hisface with his hands.'Smith!' yelled the voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.! Uncover yourface. No faces covered in the cells.'Winston uncovered his face. Parsons used the lavatory, loudly andabundantly. It then turned out that the plug was defective and the cellstank abominably for hours afterwards.Parsons was removed. More prisoners came and went, mysteriously. One, awoman, was consigned to 'Room 101', and, Winston noticed, seemed to shriveland turn a different colour when she heard the words. A time came when, ifit had been morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or ifit had been afternoon, then it would be midnight. There were six prisonersin the cell, men and women. All sat very still. Opposite Winston there sata man with a chinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large,harmless rodent. His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottomthat it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of foodtucked away there. His pale-grey eyes flitted timorously from face to faceand turned quickly away again when he caught anyone's eye.The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance senta momentary chill through Winston. He was a commonplace, mean-looking manwho might have been an engineer or technician of some kind. But what wasstartling was the emaciation of his face. It was like a skull. Because ofits thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large, and theeyes seemed filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody orsomething.The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from Winston. Winstondid not look at him again, but the tormented, skull-like face was asvivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes.Suddenly he realized what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation.The same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in thecell. There was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench. Theeyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skull-faced man, thenturning guiltily away, then being dragged back by an irresistibleattraction. Presently he began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood up,waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his overalls,and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread to theskull-faced man.There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen. The chinless manjumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man had quickly thrust his handsbehind his back, as though demonstrating to all the world that he refusedthe gift.'Bumstead!' roared the voice. '2713 Bumstead J.! Let fall that piece ofbread!'The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor.'Remain standing where you are,' said the voice. 'Face the door. Make nomovement.'The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy cheeks were quiveringuncontrollably. The door clanged open. As the young officer entered andstepped aside, there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard withenormous arms and shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chinless man,and then, at a signal from the officer, let free a frightful blow, withall the weight of his body behind it, full in the chinless man's mouth.The force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor. His bodywas flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatoryseat. For a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood oozing fromhis mouth and nose. A very faint whimpering or squeaking, which seemedunconscious, came out of him. Then he rolled over and raised himselfunsteadily on hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the twohalves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their knees. Thechinless man climbed back into his place. Down one side of his face theflesh was darkening. His mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry-colouredmass with a black hole in the middle of it.From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls.His grey eyes still flitted from face to face, more guiltily than ever,as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him forhis humiliation.The door opened. With a small gesture the officer indicated theskull-faced man.'Room 101,' he said.There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston's side. The man had actuallyflung himself on his knees on the floor, with his hand clasped together.'Comrade! Officer!' he cried. 'You don't have to take me to that place!Haven't I told you everything already? What else is it you want to know?There's nothing I wouldn't confess, nothing! Just tell me what it is andI'll confess straight off. Write it down and I'll sign it--anything!Not room 101!''Room 101,' said the officer.The man's face, already very pale, turned a colour Winston would not havebelieved possible. It was definitely, unmistakably, a shade of green.'Do anything to me!' he yelled. 'You've been starving me for weeks. Finishit off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-fiveyears. Is there somebody else you want me to give away? Just say who it isand I'll tell you anything you want. I don't care who it is or what you doto them. I've got a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn't sixyears old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats infront of my eyes, and I'll stand by and watch it. But not Room 101!''Room 101,' said the officer.The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners, as though withsome idea that he could put another victim in his own place. His eyessettled on the smashed face of the chinless man. He flung out a lean arm.'That's the one you ought to be taking, not me!' he shouted. 'You didn'thear what he was saying after they bashed his face. Give me a chance andI'll tell you every word of it. HE'S the one that's against the Party, notme.' The guards stepped forward. The man's voice rose to a shriek. 'Youdidn't hear him!' he repeated. 'Something went wrong with the telescreen.HE'S the one you want. Take him, not me!'The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms. But just atthis moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed oneof the iron legs that supported the bench. He had set up a wordlesshowling, like an animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose,but he clung on with astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty secondsthey were hauling at him. The prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed ontheir knees, looking straight in front of them. The howling stopped; theman had no breath left for anything except hanging on. Then there was adifferent kind of cry. A kick from a guard's boot had broken the fingersof one of his hands. They dragged him to his feet.'Room 101,' said the officer.The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing hiscrushed hand, all the fight had gone out of him.A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the skull-faced man wastaken away, it was morning: if morning, it was afternoon. Winston wasalone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrowbench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by thetelescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinless man haddropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it,but presently hunger gave way to thirst. His mouth was sticky andevil-tasting. The humming sound and the unvarying white light induced asort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would get upbecause the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sitdown again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure ofstaying on his feet. Whenever his physical sensations were a little undercontrol the terror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought ofO'Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor blade mightarrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thoughtof Julia. Somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he.She might be screaming with pain at this moment. He thought: 'If I couldsave Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I would.' But thatwas merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he oughtto take it. He did not feel it. In this place you could not feel anything,except pain and foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible, when youwere actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own painshould increase? But that question was not answerable yet.The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O'Brien came in.Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven allcaution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot thepresence of the telescreen.'They've got you too!' he cried.'They got me a long time ago,' said O'Brien with a mild, almost regretfulirony. He stepped aside. From behind him there emerged a broad-chestedguard with a long black truncheon in his hand.'You know this, Winston,' said O'Brien. 'Don't deceive yourself. You didknow it--you have always known it.'Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no time to think ofthat. All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard's hand. It mightfall anywhere; on the crown, on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, onthe elbow----The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost paralysed, clasping thestricken elbow with his other hand. Everything had exploded into yellowlight. Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain!The light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him. Theguard was laughing at his contortions. One question at any rate wasanswered. Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increaseof pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop.Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of painthere are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he writhedon the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm.Chapter 2He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it washigher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that hecould not move. Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on hisface. O'Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. Atthe other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermicsyringe.Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually.He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quitedifferent world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. How long hehad been down there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrestedhim he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his memories were notcontinuous. There had been times when consciousness, even the sort ofconsciousness that one has in sleep, had stopped dead and started againafter a blank interval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeksor only seconds, there was no way of knowing.With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started. Later he wasto realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routineinterrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was along range of crimes--espionage, sabotage, and the like--to which everyonehad to confess as a matter of course. The confession was a formality,though the torture was real. How many times he had been beaten, how longthe beatings had continued, he could not remember. Always there were fiveor six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes it wasfists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimesit was boots. There were times when he rolled about the floor, as shamelessas an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopelesseffort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet more kicks,in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin,in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine. There were timeswhen it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemedto him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could notforce himself into losing consciousness. There were times when his nerveso forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beatingbegan, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enoughto make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. Therewere other times when he started out with the resolve of confessingnothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps ofpain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when hesaid to himself: 'I will confess, but not yet. I must hold out till thepain becomes unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I willtell them what they want.' Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardlystand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell,left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again.There were also longer periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly,because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor. He remembered a cellwith a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tinwash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee. Heremembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair,and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse,tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers overhim in search for broken bones, and shooting needles into his arm to makehim sleep.The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horrorto which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers wereunsatisfactory. His questioners now were not ruffians in black uniformsbut Party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements andflashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods whichlasted--he thought, he could not be sure--ten or twelve hours at a stretch.These other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain, butit was not chiefly pain that they relied on. They slapped his face, wrunghis ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave tourinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water;but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power ofarguing and reasoning. Their real weapon was the merciless questioningthat went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps forhim, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step oflies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame asfrom nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in asingle session. Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatenedat every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimesthey would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him inthe name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether evennow he had not enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish toundo the evil he had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours ofquestioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears. In theend the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots andfists of the guards. He became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand thatsigned, whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was to find outwhat they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before thebullying started anew. He confessed to the assassination of eminent Partymembers, the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of publicfunds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He confessed thathe had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as1968. He confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer ofcapitalism, and a sexual pervert. He confessed that he had murdered hiswife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wifewas still alive. He confessed that for years he had been in personal touchwith Goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization whichhad included almost every human being he had ever known. It was easier toconfess everything and implicate everybody. Besides, in a sense it was alltrue. It was true that he had been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyesof the Party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed.There were also memories of another kind. They stood out in his minddisconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.He was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because hecould see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near at hand some kind ofinstrument was ticking slowly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and moreluminous. Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, andwas swallowed up.He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights.A man in a white coat was reading the dials. There was a tramp of heavyboots outside. The door clanged open. The waxed-faced officer marched in,followed by two guards.'Room 101,' said the officer.The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not look at Winstoneither; he was looking only at the dials.He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious,golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at thetop of his voice. He was confessing everything, even the things he hadsucceeded in holding back under the torture. He was relating the entirehistory of his life to an audience who knew it already. With him were theguards, the other questioners, the men in white coats, O'Brien, Julia,Mr Charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting withlaughter. Some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future hadsomehow been skipped over and had not happened. Everything was all right,there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare,understood, forgiven.He was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he hadheard O'Brien's voice. All through his interrogation, although he hadnever seen him, he had had the feeling that O'Brien was at his elbow, justout of sight. It was O'Brien who was directing everything. It was he whoset the guards on to Winston and who prevented them from killing him. Itwas he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he shouldhave a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when thedrugs should be pumped into his arm. It was he who asked the questions andsuggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he wasthe inquisitor, he was the friend. And once--Winston could not rememberwhether it was in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a momentof wakefulness--a voice murmured in his ear: 'Don't worry, Winston; youare in my keeping. For seven years I have watched over you. Now theturning-point has come. I shall save you, I shall make you perfect.' Hewas not sure whether it was O'Brien's voice; but it was the same voicethat had said to him, 'We shall meet in the place where there is nodarkness,' in that other dream, seven years ago.He did not remember any ending to his interrogation. There was a period ofblackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had graduallymaterialized round him. He was almost flat on his back, and unable to move.His body was held down at every essential point. Even the back of his headwas gripped in some manner. O'Brien was looking down at him gravely andrather sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn, withpouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was olderthan Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty. Underhis hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running roundthe face.'I told you,' said O'Brien, 'that if we met again it would be here.''Yes,' said Winston.Without any warning except a slight movement of O'Brien's hand, a wave ofpain flooded his body. It was a frightening pain, because he could not seewhat was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury wasbeing done to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening,or whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was beingwrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. Althoughthe pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all wasthe fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his teeth andbreathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible.'You are afraid,' said O'Brien, watching his face, 'that in another momentsomething is going to break. Your especial fear is that it will be yourbackbone. You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apartand the spinal fluid dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking,is it not, Winston?'Winston did not answer. O'Brien drew back the lever on the dial. The waveof pain receded almost as quickly as it had come.'That was forty,' said O'Brien. 'You can see that the numbers on this dialrun up to a hundred. Will you please remember, throughout our conversation,that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and towhatever degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt toprevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual level ofintelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you understandthat?''Yes,' said Winston.O'Brien's manner became less severe. He resettled his spectaclesthoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and down. When he spoke his voicewas gentle and patient. He had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even apriest, anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish.'I am taking trouble with you, Winston,' he said, 'because you are worthtrouble. You know perfectly well what is the matter with you. You haveknown it for years, though you have fought against the knowledge. You arementally deranged. You suffer from a defective memory. You are unable toremember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember otherevents which never happened. Fortunately it is curable. You have nevercured yourself of it, because you did not choose to. There was a smalleffort of the will that you were not ready to make. Even now, I am wellaware, you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it isa virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment, which power isOceania at war with?''When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.''With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia,has it not?'Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to speak and then did notspeak. He could not take his eyes away from the dial.'The truth, please, Winston. YOUR truth. Tell me what you think youremember.''I remember that until only a week before I was arrested, we were not atwar with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance with them. The war wasagainst Eurasia. That had lasted for four years. Before that----'O'Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.'Another example,' he said. 'Some years ago you had a very serious delusionindeed. You believed that three men, three one-time Party members namedJones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--men who were executed for treachery andsabotage after making the fullest possible confession--were not guilty ofthe crimes they were charged with. You believed that you had seenunmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions werefalse. There was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination.You believed that you had actually held it in your hands. It was aphotograph something like this.'An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien's fingers. Forperhaps five seconds it was within the angle of Winston's vision. It wasa photograph, and there was no question of its identity. It was THEphotograph. It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, andRutherford at the party function in New York, which he had chanced uponeleven years ago and promptly destroyed. For only an instant it was beforehis eyes, then it was out of sight again. But he had seen it,unquestionably he had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort towrench the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so much asa centimetre in any direction. For the moment he had even forgotten thedial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or atleast to see it.'It exists!' he cried.'No,' said O'Brien.He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole in the opposite wall.O'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirlingaway on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame.O'Brien turned away from the wall.'Ashes,' he said. 'Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It does not exist.It never existed.''But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it.You remember it.''I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.Winston's heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a feeling of deadlyhelplessness. If he could have been certain that O'Brien was lying, itwould not have seemed to matter. But it was perfectly possible that O'Brienhad really forgotten the photograph. And if so, then already he would haveforgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act offorgetting. How could one be sure that it was simple trickery? Perhapsthat lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was thethought that defeated him.O'Brien was looking down at him speculatively. More than ever he had theair of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child.'There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of the past,' he said.'Repeat it, if you please.''"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the presentcontrols the past,"' repeated Winston obediently.'"Who controls the present controls the past,"' said O'Brien, nodding hishead with slow approval. 'Is it your opinion, Winston, that the past hasreal existence?'Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston. His eyes flittedtowards the dial. He not only did not know whether 'yes' or 'no' was theanswer that would save him from pain; he did not even know which answer hebelieved to be the true one.O'Brien smiled faintly. 'You are no metaphysician, Winston,' he said.'Until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. Iwill put it more precisely. Does the past exist concretely, in space? Isthere somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the pastis still happening?''No.''Then where does the past exist, if at all?''In records. It is written down.''In records. And----?''In the mind. In human memories.''In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all records, and wecontrol all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?''But how can you stop people remembering things?' cried Winston againmomentarily forgetting the dial. 'It is involuntary. It is outside oneself.How can you control memory? You have not controlled mine!'O'Brien's manner grew stern again. He laid his hand on the dial.'On the contrary,' he said, 'YOU have not controlled it. That is what hasbrought you here. You are here because you have failed in humility, inself-discipline. You would not make the act of submission which is theprice of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only thedisciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality issomething objective, external, existing in its own right. You also believethat the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself intothinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees thesame thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external.Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individualmind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in themind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Partyholds to be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except bylooking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that you have gotto relearn, Winston. It needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of thewill. You must humble yourself before you can become sane.'He paused for a few moments, as though to allow what he had been saying tosink in.'Do you remember,' he went on, 'writing in your diary, "Freedom is thefreedom to say that two plus two make four"?''Yes,' said Winston.O'Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumbhidden and the four fingers extended.'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?''Four.''And if the party says that it is not four but five--then how many?''Four.'The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial had shot up tofifty-five. The sweat had sprung out all over Winston's body. The air toreinto his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching histeeth he could not stop. O'Brien watched him, the four fingers stillextended. He drew back the lever. This time the pain was only slightlyeased.'How many fingers, Winston?''Four.'The needle went up to sixty.'How many fingers, Winston?''Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!'The needle must have risen again, but he did not look at it. The heavy,stern face and the four fingers filled his vision. The fingers stood upbefore his eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate,but unmistakably four.'How many fingers, Winston?''Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!''How many fingers, Winston?''Five! Five! Five!''No, Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still think there arefour. How many fingers, please?''Four! five! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop the pain!'Abruptly he was sitting up with O'Brien's arm round his shoulders. He hadperhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. The bonds that had held hisbody down were loosened. He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably,his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. For amoment he clung to O'Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavyarm round his shoulders. He had the feeling that O'Brien was his protector,that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source,and that it was O'Brien who would save him from it.'You are a slow learner, Winston,' said O'Brien gently.'How can I help it?' he blubbered. 'How can I help seeing what is in frontof my eyes? Two and two are four.''Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three.Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is noteasy to become sane.'He laid Winston down on the bed. The grip of his limbs tightened again,but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving himmerely weak and cold. O'Brien motioned with his head to the man in thewhite coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. The man inthe white coat bent down and looked closely into Winston's eyes, felt hispulse, laid an ear against his chest, tapped here and there, then henodded to O'Brien.'Again,' said O'Brien.The pain flowed into Winston's body. The needle must be at seventy,seventy-five. He had shut his eyes this time. He knew that the fingerswere still there, and still four. All that mattered was somehow to stayalive until the spasm was over. He had ceased to notice whether he wascrying out or not. The pain lessened again. He opened his eyes. O'Brienhad drawn back the lever.'How many fingers, Winston?''Four. I suppose there are four. I would see five if I could. I am tryingto see five.''Which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or really to seethem?''Really to see them.''Again,' said O'Brien.Perhaps the needle was eighty--ninety. Winston could not intermittentlyremember why the pain was happening. Behind his screwed-up eyelids aforest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in andout, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again. He was tryingto count them, he could not remember why. He knew only that it wasimpossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the mysteriousidentity between five and four. The pain died down again. When he openedhis eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing.Innumerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streaming past ineither direction, crossing and recrossing. He shut his eyes again.'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?''I don't know. I don't know. You will kill me if you do that again. Four,five, six--in all honesty I don't know.''Better,' said O'Brien.A needle slid into Winston's arm. Almost in the same instant a blissful,healing warmth spread all through his body. The pain was alreadyhalf-forgotten. He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O'Brien.At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heartseemed to turn over. If he could have moved he would have stretched outa hand and laid it on O'Brien's arm. He had never loved him so deeply asat this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain. The oldfeeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether O'Brien was a friendor an enemy, had come back. O'Brien was a person who could be talked to.Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. O'Brienhad tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it wascertain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference. In somesense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere orother, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a placewhere they could meet and talk. O'Brien was looking down at him with anexpression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind.When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.'Do you know where you are, Winston?' he said.'I don't know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.''Do you know how long you have been here?''I don't know. Days, weeks, months--I think it is months.''And why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?''To make them confess.''No, that is not the reason. Try again.''To punish them.''No!' exclaimed O'Brien. His voice had changed extraordinarily, and hisface had suddenly become both stern and animated. 'No! Not merely toextract your confession, not to punish you. Shall I tell you why we havebrought you here? To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand,Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our handsuncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you havecommitted. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought isall we care about. We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them.Do you understand what I mean by that?'He was bending over Winston. His face looked enormous because of itsnearness, and hideously ugly because it was seen from below. Moreover itwas filled with a sort of exaltation, a lunatic intensity. Again Winston'sheart shrank. If it had been possible he would have cowered deeper intothe bed. He felt certain that O'Brien was about to twist the dial out ofsheer wantonness. At this moment, however, O'Brien turned away. He took apace or two up and down. Then he continued less vehemently:'The first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are nomartyrdoms. You have read of the religious persecutions of the past. Inthe Middle Ages there was the Inquisition. It was a failure. It set outto eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic itburned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Becausethe Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them whilethey were still unrepentant: in fact, it killed them because they wereunrepentant. Men were dying because they would not abandon their truebeliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shameto the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, therewere the totalitarians, as they were called. There were the German Nazisand the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more cruellythan the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that they had learnedfrom the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must notmake martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial, theydeliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them downby torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches,confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves withabuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy.And yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again.The dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Onceagain, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that theyhad made were obviously extorted and untrue. We do not make mistakes ofthat kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are true. We makethem true. And above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us.You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Winston.Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out from thestream of history. We shall turn you into gas and pour you into thestratosphere. Nothing will remain of you, not a name in a register, nota memory in a living brain. You will be annihilated in the past as wellas in the future. You will never have existed.'Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a momentarybitterness. O'Brien checked his step as though Winston had uttered thethought aloud. His large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a littlenarrowed.'You are thinking,' he said, 'that since we intend to destroy you utterly,so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference--inthat case, why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first? That iswhat you were thinking, was it not?''Yes,' said Winston.O'Brien smiled slightly. 'You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You area stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell you just now that we aredifferent from the persecutors of the past? We are not content withnegative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission. When finallyyou surrender to us, it must be of your own free will. We do not destroythe heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we neverdestroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him.We burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to ourside, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one ofourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that an erroneousthought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerlessit may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation. Inthe old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiminghis heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges couldcarry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passagewaiting for the bullet. But we make the brain perfect before we blow itout. The command of the old despotisms was "Thou shalt not". The commandof the totalitarians was "Thou shalt". Our command is "THOU ART". No onewhom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washedclean. Even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you oncebelieved--Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--in the end we broke them down.I took part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down,whimpering, grovelling, weeping--and in the end it was not with pain orfear, only with penitence. By the time we had finished with them they wereonly the shells of men. There was nothing left in them except sorrow forwhat they had done, and love of Big Brother. It was touching to seehow they loved him. They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could diewhile their minds were still clean.'His voice had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm,was still in his face. He is not pretending, thought Winston, he is not ahypocrite, he believes every word he says. What most oppressed him was theconsciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. He watched the heavyyet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range of hisvision. O'Brien was a being in all ways larger than himself. There was noidea that he had ever had, or could have, that O'Brien had not long agoknown, examined, and rejected. His mind CONTAINED Winston's mind. Butin that case how could it be true that O'Brien was mad? It must be he,Winston, who was mad. O'Brien halted and looked down at him. His voice hadgrown stern again.'Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, however completelyyou surrender to us. No one who has once gone astray is ever spared. Andeven if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life, stillyou would never escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever.Understand that in advance. We shall crush you down to the point fromwhich there is no coming back. Things will happen to you from which youcould not recover, if you lived a thousand years. Never again will you becapable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you.Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living,or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow.We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.'He paused and signed to the man in the white coat. Winston was aware ofsome heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head.O'Brien had sat down beside the bed, so that his face was almost on alevel with Winston's.'Three thousand,' he said, speaking over Winston's head to the man in thewhite coat.Two soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped themselves againstWinston's temples. He quailed. There was pain coming, a new kind of pain.O'Brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.'This time it will not hurt,' he said. 'Keep your eyes fixed on mine.'At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what seemed like anexplosion, though it was not certain whether there was any noise. Therewas undoubtedly a blinding flash of light. Winston was not hurt, onlyprostrated. Although he had already been lying on his back when the thinghappened, he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into thatposition. A terrific painless blow had flattened him out. Also somethinghad happened inside his head. As his eyes regained their focus heremembered who he was, and where he was, and recognized the face that wasgazing into his own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch ofemptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his brain.'It will not last,' said O'Brien. 'Look me in the eyes. What country isOceania at war with?'Winston thought. He knew what was meant by Oceania and that he himself wasa citizen of Oceania. He also remembered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who wasat war with whom he did not know. In fact he had not been aware that therewas any war.'I don't remember.''Oceania is at war with Eastasia. Do you remember that now?''Yes.''Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Since the beginning of yourlife, since the beginning of the Party, since the beginning of history,the war has continued without a break, always the same war. Do youremember that?''Yes.''Eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had beencondemned to death for treachery. You pretended that you had seen a pieceof paper which proved them innocent. No such piece of paper ever existed.You invented it, and later you grew to believe in it. You remember now thevery moment at which you first invented it. Do you remember that?''Yes.''Just now I held up the fingers of my hand to you. You saw five fingers.Do you remember that?''Yes.'O'Brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with the thumb concealed.'There are five fingers there. Do you see five fingers?''Yes.'And he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before the scenery of hismind changed. He saw five fingers, and there was no deformity. Theneverything was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and thebewilderment came crowding back again. But there had been a moment--he didnot know how long, thirty seconds, perhaps--of luminous certainty, wheneach new suggestion of O'Brien's had filled up a patch of emptiness andbecome absolute truth, and when two and two could have been three aseasily as five, if that were what was needed. It had faded but beforeO'Brien had dropped his hand; but though he could not recapture it, hecould remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience at some period ofone's life when one was in effect a different person.'You see now,' said O'Brien, 'that it is at any rate possible.''Yes,' said Winston.O'Brien stood up with a satisfied air. Over to his left Winston saw theman in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of asyringe. O'Brien turned to Winston with a smile. In almost the old mannerhe resettled his spectacles on his nose.'Do you remember writing in your diary,' he said, 'that it did not matterwhether I was a friend or an enemy, since I was at least a person whounderstood you and could be talked to? You were right. I enjoy talking toyou. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that youhappen to be insane. Before we bring the session to an end you can ask mea few questions, if you choose.''Any question I like?''Anything.' He saw that Winston's eyes were upon the dial. 'It is switchedoff. What is your first question?''What have you done with Julia?' said Winston.O'Brien smiled again. 'She betrayed you, Winston. Immediately--unreservedly.I have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly. You would hardlyrecognize her if you saw her. All her rebelliousness, her deceit, herfolly, her dirty-mindedness--everything has been burned out of her. It wasa perfect conversion, a textbook case.''You tortured her?'O'Brien left this unanswered. 'Next question,' he said.'Does Big Brother exist?''Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is the embodiment ofthe Party.''Does he exist in the same way as I exist?''You do not exist,' said O'Brien.Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. He knew, or he couldimagine, the arguments which proved his own nonexistence; but they werenonsense, they were only a play on words. Did not the statement, 'You donot exist', contain a logical absurdity? But what use was it to say so?His mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments withwhich O'Brien would demolish him.'I think I exist,' he said wearily. 'I am conscious of my own identity.I was born and I shall die. I have arms and legs. I occupy a particularpoint in space. No other solid object can occupy the same pointsimultaneously. In that sense, does Big Brother exist?''It is of no importance. He exists.''Will Big Brother ever die?''Of course not. How could he die? Next question.''Does the Brotherhood exist?''That, Winston, you will never know. If we choose to set you free when wehave finished with you, and if you live to be ninety years old, still youwill never learn whether the answer to that question is Yes or No. As longas you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.'Winston lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster. He still hadnot asked the question that had come into his mind the first. He had gotto ask it, and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it. Therewas a trace of amusement in O'Brien's face. Even his spectacles seemed towear an ironical gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly, he knows whatI am going to ask! At the thought the words burst out of him:'What is in Room 101?'The expression on O'Brien's face did not change. He answered drily:'You know what is in Room 101, Winston. Everyone knows what is inRoom 101.'He raised a finger to the man in the white coat. Evidently the session wasat an end. A needle jerked into Winston's arm. He sank almost instantlyinto deep sleep.Chapter 3'There are three stages in your reintegration,' said O'Brien. 'There islearning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance. It is time foryou to enter upon the second stage.'As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late his bonds werelooser. They still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees alittle and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms fromthe elbow. The dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He couldevade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when heshowed stupidity that O'Brien pulled the lever. Sometimes they got througha whole session without use of the dial. He could not remember how manysessions there had been. The whole process seemed to stretch out over along, indefinite time--weeks, possibly--and the intervals between thesessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two.'As you lie there,' said O'Brien, 'you have often wondered--you have evenasked me--why the Ministry of Love should expend so much time and troubleon you. And when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentiallythe same question. You could grasp the mechanics of the Society you livedin, but not its underlying motives. Do you remember writing in your diary,"I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY"? It was when you thought about"why" that you doubted your own sanity. You have read THE BOOK,Goldstein's book, or parts of it, at least. Did it tell you anything thatyou did not know already?''You have read it?' said Winston.'I wrote it. That is to say, I collaborated in writing it. No book isproduced individually, as you know.''Is it true, what it says?''As description, yes. The programme it sets forth is nonsense. The secretaccumulation of knowledge--a gradual spread of enlightenment--ultimatelya proletarian rebellion--the overthrow of the Party. You foresaw yourselfthat that was what it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians willnever revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I donot have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have evercherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. Thereis no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party isfor ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.'He came closer to the bed. 'For ever!' he repeated. 'And now let us getback to the question of "how" and "why". You understand well enough HOWthe Party maintains itself in power. Now tell me WHY we cling to power.What is our motive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak,' he added asWinston remained silent.Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two. A feeling ofweariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had comeback into O'Brien's face. He knew in advance what O'Brien would say. Thatthe Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good ofthe majority. That it sought power because men in the mass were frail,cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, andmust be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were strongerthan themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom andhappiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better.That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sectdoing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that ofothers. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing was thatwhen O'Brien said this he would believe it. You could see it in his face.O'Brien knew everything. A thousand times better than Winston he knew whatthe world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beingslived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept them there. He hadunderstood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all wasjustified by the ultimate purpose. What can you do, thought Winston,against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives yourarguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?'You are ruling over us for our own good,' he said feebly. 'You believethat human beings are not fit to govern themselves, and therefore----'He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shot through his body.O'Brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five.'That was stupid, Winston, stupid!' he said. 'You should know better thanto say a thing like that.'He pulled the lever back and continued:'Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Partyseeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the goodof others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or longlife or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you willunderstand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of thepast, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those whoresembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and theRussian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they neverhad the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhapsthey even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for alimited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise wherehuman beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know thatno one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power isnot a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in orderto safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establishthe dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object oftorture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin tounderstand me?'Winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the tiredness ofO'Brien's face. It was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was full ofintelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himselfhelpless; but it was tired. There were pouches under the eyes, the skinsagged from the cheekbones. O'Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringingthe worn face nearer.'You are thinking,' he said, 'that my face is old and tired. You arethinking that I talk of power, and yet I am not even able to prevent thedecay of my own body. Can you not understand, Winston, that the individualis only a cell? The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism.Do you die when you cut your fingernails?'He turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again, one handin his pocket.'We are the priests of power,' he said. 'God is power. But at presentpower is only a word so far as you are concerned. It is time for you togather some idea of what power means. The first thing you must realizeis that power is collective. The individual only has power in so far ashe ceases to be an individual. You know the Party slogan: "Freedom isSlavery". Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery isfreedom. Alone--free--the human being is always defeated. It must be so,because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of allfailures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escapefrom his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he IS theParty, then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for you torealize is that power is power over human beings. Over the body--but, aboveall, over the mind. Power over matter--external reality, as you would callit--is not important. Already our control over matter is absolute.'For a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a violent effort to raisehimself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching hisbody painfully.'But how can you control matter?' he burst out. 'You don't even controlthe climate or the law of gravity. And there are disease, pain, death----'O'Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. 'We control matter becausewe control the mind. Reality is inside the skull. You will learn bydegrees, Winston. There is nothing that we could not do. Invisibility,levitation--anything. I could float off this floor like a soap bubble ifI wish to. I do not wish to, because the Party does not wish it. You mustget rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature. Wemake the laws of Nature.''But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. What aboutEurasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered them yet.''Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. And if we did not,what difference would it make? We can shut them out of existence. Oceaniais the world.''But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is tiny--helpless!How long has he been in existence? For millions of years the earth wasuninhabited.''Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older?Nothing exists except through human consciousness.''But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals--mammoths andmastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was everheard of.''Have you ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not. Nineteenth-centurybiologists invented them. Before man there was nothing. After man, if hecould come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man there isnothing.''But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars! Some of them area million light-years away. They are out of our reach for ever.''What are the stars?' said O'Brien indifferently. 'They are bits of firea few kilometres away. We could reach them if we wanted to. Or we couldblot them out. The earth is the centre of the universe. The sun and thestars go round it.'Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he did not sayanything. O'Brien continued as though answering a spoken objection:'For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When we navigate theocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient toassume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millionsupon millions of kilometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it isbeyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be nearor distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose our mathematiciansare unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?'Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, the swift answercrushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he knew, he KNEW, that he was in theright. The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind--surely theremust be some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it not beenexposed long ago as a fallacy? There was even a name for it, which hehad forgotten. A faint smile twitched the corners of O'Brien's mouth ashe looked down at him.'I told you, Winston,' he said, 'that metaphysics is not your strongpoint. The word you are trying to think of is solipsism. But you aremistaken. This is not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. Butthat is a different thing: in fact, the opposite thing. All this is adigression,' he added in a different tone. 'The real power, the power wehave to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men.'He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmasterquestioning a promising pupil: 'How does one man assert his power overanother, Winston?'Winston thought. 'By making him suffer,' he said.'Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he issuffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not hisown? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearinghuman minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes ofyour own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we arecreating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias thatthe old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, aworld of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow notless but MORE merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world willbe progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that theywere founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our worldthere will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement.Everything else we shall destroy--everything. Already we are breaking downthe habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. Wehave cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, andbetween man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friendany longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends.Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs froma hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annualformality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm.Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, exceptloyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love ofBig Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph overa defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. Whenwe are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will beno distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity,no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will bedestroyed. But always--do not forget this, Winston--always there will bethe intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growingsubtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory,the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want apicture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.'He paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Winston had tried toshrink back into the surface of the bed again. He could not say anything.His heart seemed to be frozen. O'Brien went on:'And remember that it is for ever. The face will always be there to bestamped upon. The heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, sothat he can be defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that youhave undergone since you have been in our hands--all that will continue,and worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, theexecutions, the disappearances will never cease. It will be a world ofterror as much as a world of triumph. The more the Party is powerful, theless it will be tolerant: the weaker the opposition, the tighter thedespotism. Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day, atevery moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon andyet they will always survive. This drama that I have played out with youduring seven years will be played out over and over again generation aftergeneration, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic hereat our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible--and in the endutterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his ownaccord. That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world ofvictory after victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endlesspressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning,I can see, to realize what that world will be like. But in the end youwill do more than understand it. You will accept it, welcome it, becomepart of it.'Winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak. 'You can't!' he saidweakly.'What do you mean by that remark, Winston?''You could not create such a world as you have just described. It is adream. It is impossible.''Why?''It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty.It would never endure.''Why not?''It would have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would commitsuicide.''Nonsense. You are under the impression that hatred is more exhaustingthan love. Why should it be? And if it were, what difference would thatmake? Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster. Suppose that wequicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. Still whatdifference would it make? Can you not understand that the death of theindividual is not death? The party is immortal.'As usual, the voice had battered Winston into helplessness. Moreover hewas in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement O'Brien would twistthe dial again. And yet he could not keep silent. Feebly, withoutarguments, with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror ofwhat O'Brien had said, he returned to the attack.'I don't know--I don't care. Somehow you will fail. Something will defeatyou. Life will defeat you.''We control life, Winston, at all its levels. You are imagining that thereis something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do andwill turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitelymalleable. Or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that theproletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us. Put it out of yourmind. They are helpless, like the animals. Humanity is the Party. Theothers are outside--irrelevant.''I don't care. In the end they will beat you. Sooner or later they willsee you for what you are, and then they will tear you to pieces.''Do you see any evidence that that is happening? Or any reason why itshould?''No. I believe it. I KNOW that you will fail. There is something in theuniverse--I don't know, some spirit, some principle--that you will neverovercome.''Do you believe in God, Winston?''No.''Then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?''I don't know. The spirit of Man.''And do you consider yourself a man?''Yes.''If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Your kind is extinct; weare the inheritors. Do you understand that you are ALONE? You are outsidehistory, you are non-existent.' His manner changed and he said moreharshly: 'And you consider yourself morally superior to us, with our liesand our cruelty?''Yes, I consider myself superior.'O'Brien did not speak. Two other voices were speaking. After a momentWinston recognized one of them as his own. It was a sound-track of theconversation he had had with O'Brien, on the night when he had enrolledhimself in the Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal,to forge, to murder, to encourage drug-taking and prostitution, todisseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a child's face. O'Brienmade a small impatient gesture, as though to say that the demonstrationwas hardly worth making. Then he turned a switch and the voices stopped.'Get up from that bed,' he said.The bonds had loosened themselves. Winston lowered himself to the floorand stood up unsteadily.'You are the last man,' said O'Brien. 'You are the guardian of the humanspirit. You shall see yourself as you are. Take off your clothes.'Winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together. The zipfastener had long since been wrenched out of them. He could not rememberwhether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes atone time. Beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowishrags, just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As he slidthem to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the farend of the room. He approached it, then stopped short. An involuntary cryhad broken out of him.'Go on,' said O'Brien. 'Stand between the wings of the mirror. You shallsee the side view as well.'He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, grey-coloured,skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. Its actual appearance wasfrightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. Hemoved closer to the glass. The creature's face seemed to be protruded,because of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird's face with a nobbyforehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, andbattered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful.The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it washis own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he hadchanged inside. The emotions it registered would be different from theones he felt. He had gone partially bald. For the first moment he hadthought that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the scalp that wasgrey. Except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey allover with ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt therewere the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was aninflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly frighteningthing was the emaciation of his body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrowas that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thickerthan the thighs. He saw now what O'Brien had meant about seeing the sideview. The curvature of the spine was astonishing. The thin shoulders werehunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neckseemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess hewould have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering fromsome malignant disease.'You have thought sometimes,' said O'Brien, 'that my face--the face of amember of the Inner Party--looks old and worn. What do you think of yourown face?'He seized Winston's shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him.'Look at the condition you are in!' he said. 'Look at this filthy grimeall over your body. Look at the dirt between your toes. Look at thatdisgusting running sore on your leg. Do you know that you stink like agoat? Probably you have ceased to notice it. Look at your emaciation. Doyou see? I can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep. I couldsnap your neck like a carrot. Do you know that you have lost twenty-fivekilograms since you have been in our hands? Even your hair is coming outin handfuls. Look!' He plucked at Winston's head and brought away a tuftof hair. 'Open your mouth. Nine, ten, eleven teeth left. How many had youwhen you came to us? And the few you have left are dropping out of yourhead. Look here!'He seized one of Winston's remaining front teeth between his powerfulthumb and forefinger. A twinge of pain shot through Winston's jaw. O'Brienhad wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across thecell.'You are rotting away,' he said; 'you are falling to pieces. What are you?A bag of filth. Now turn around and look into that mirror again. Do yousee that thing facing you? That is the last man. If you are human, that ishumanity. Now put your clothes on again.'Winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements. Until now he hadnot seemed to notice how thin and weak he was. Only one thought stirred inhis mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined.Then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling ofpity for his ruined body overcame him. Before he knew what he was doinghe had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burstinto tears. He was aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle ofbones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: buthe could not stop himself. O'Brien laid a hand on his shoulder, almostkindly.'It will not last for ever,' he said. 'You can escape from it whenever youchoose. Everything depends on yourself.''You did it!' sobbed Winston. 'You reduced me to this state.''No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what you accepted whenyou set yourself up against the Party. It was all contained in that firstact. Nothing has happened that you did not foresee.'He paused, and then went on:'We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. You have seen whatyour body is like. Your mind is in the same state. I do not think therecan be much pride left in you. You have been kicked and flogged andinsulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor inyour own blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayedeverybody and everything. Can you think of a single degradation that hasnot happened to you?'Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of hiseyes. He looked up at O'Brien.'I have not betrayed Julia,' he said.O'Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. 'No,' he said; 'no; that isperfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia.'The peculiar reverence for O'Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy,flooded Winston's heart again. How intelligent, he thought, howintelligent! Never did O'Brien fail to understand what was said to him.Anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he HAD betrayedJulia. For what was there that they had not screwed out of him under thetorture? He had told them everything he knew about her, her habits, hercharacter, her past life; he had confessed in the most trivial detaileverything that had happened at their meetings, all that he had said toher and she to him, their black-market meals, their adulteries, theirvague plottings against the Party--everything. And yet, in the sense inwhich he intended the word, he had not betrayed her. He had not stoppedloving her; his feelings towards her had remained the same. O'Brien hadseen what he meant without the need for explanation.'Tell me,' he said, 'how soon will they shoot me?''It might be a long time,' said O'Brien. 'You are a difficult case. Butdon't give up hope. Everyone is cured sooner or later. In the end we shallshoot you.'Chapter 4He was much better. He was growing fatter and stronger every day, if itwas proper to speak of days.The white light and the humming sound were the same as ever, but the cellwas a little more comfortable than the others he had been in. There was apillow and a mattress on the plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They hadgiven him a bath, and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequentlyin a tin basin. They even gave him warm water to wash with. They had givenhim new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls. They had dressed hisvaricose ulcer with soothing ointment. They had pulled out the remnantsof his teeth and given him a new set of dentures.Weeks or months must have passed. It would have been possible now to keepcount of the passage of time, if he had felt any interest in doing so,since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals. He wasgetting, he judged, three meals in the twenty-four hours; sometimes hewondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day. The foodwas surprisingly good, with meat at every third meal. Once there was evena packet of cigarettes. He had no matches, but the never-speaking guardwho brought his food would give him a light. The first time he tried tosmoke it made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the packet out fora long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal.They had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to thecorner. At first he made no use of it. Even when he was awake he wascompletely torpid. Often he would lie from one meal to the next almostwithout stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveriesin which it was too much trouble to open his eyes. He had long grownused to sleeping with a strong light on his face. It seemed to make nodifference, except that one's dreams were more coherent. He dreamed agreat deal all through this time, and they were always happy dreams. Hewas in the Golden Country, or he was sitting among enormous glorious,sunlit ruins, with his mother, with Julia, with O'Brien--not doinganything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things. Suchthoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams. Heseemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort, now that thestimulus of pain had been removed. He was not bored, he had no desirefor conversation or distraction. Merely to be alone, not to be beatenor questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, wascompletely satisfying.By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt noimpulse to get off the bed. All he cared for was to lie quiet and feel thestrength gathering in his body. He would finger himself here and there,trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles weregrowing rounder and his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond adoubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely thickerthan his knees. After that, reluctantly at first, he began exercisinghimself regularly. In a little while he could walk three kilometres,measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growingstraighter. He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished andhumiliated to find what things he could not do. He could not move out of awalk, he could not hold his stool out at arm's length, he could not standon one leg without falling over. He squatted down on his heels, and foundthat with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself toa standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weightby his hands. It was hopeless, he could not raise himself a centimetre.But after a few more days--a few more mealtimes--even that feat wasaccomplished. A time came when he could do it six times running. He beganto grow actually proud of his body, and to cherish an intermittent beliefthat his face also was growing back to normal. Only when he chanced to puthis hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed, ruined face thathad looked back at him out of the mirror.His mind grew more active. He sat down on the plank bed, his back againstthe wall and the slate on his knees, and set to work deliberately at thetask of re-educating himself.He had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as he saw now, he hadbeen ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision. From themoment when he was inside the Ministry of Love--and yes, even during thoseminutes when he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from thetelescreen told them what to do--he had grasped the frivolity, theshallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of theParty. He knew now that for seven years the Thought Police had watched himlike a beetle under a magnifying glass. There was no physical act, no wordspoken aloud, that they had not noticed, no train of thought that they hadnot been able to infer. Even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of hisdiary they had carefully replaced. They had played sound-tracks to him,shown him photographs. Some of them were photographs of Julia and himself.Yes, even... He could not fight against the Party any longer. Besides,the Party was in the right. It must be so; how could the immortal,collective brain be mistaken? By what external standard could you checkits judgements? Sanity was statistical. It was merely a question oflearning to think as they thought. Only----!The pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers. He began to write downthe thoughts that came into his head. He wrote first in large clumsycapitals:FREEDOM IS SLAVERYThen almost without a pause he wrote beneath it:TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVEBut then there came a sort of check. His mind, as though shying away fromsomething, seemed unable to concentrate. He knew that he knew what camenext, but for the moment he could not recall it. When he did recall it,it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be: it did not comeof its own accord. He wrote:GOD IS POWERHe accepted everything. The past was alterable. The past never had beenaltered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at warwith Eastasia. Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were guilty of the crimesthey were charged with. He had never seen the photograph that disprovedtheir guilt. It had never existed, he had invented it. He rememberedremembering contrary things, but those were false memories, products ofself-deception. How easy it all was! Only surrender, and everything elsefollowed. It was like swimming against a current that swept you backwardshowever hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to turn round andgo with the current instead of opposing it. Nothing had changed exceptyour own attitude: the predestined thing happened in any case. He hardlyknew why he had ever rebelled. Everything was easy, except----!Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature were nonsense. Thelaw of gravity was nonsense. 'If I wished,' O'Brien had said, 'I couldfloat off this floor like a soap bubble.' Winston worked it out. 'If heTHINKS he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously THINK I see himdo it, then the thing happens.' Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckagebreaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: 'It doesn'treally happen. We imagine it. It is hallucination.' He pushed the thoughtunder instantly. The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that somewhereor other, outside oneself, there was a 'real' world where 'real' thingshappened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we ofanything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind.Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.He had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and he was in no dangerof succumbing to it. He realized, nevertheless, that it ought never tohave occurred to him. The mind should develop a blind spot whenever adangerous thought presented itself. The process should be automatic,instinctive. CRIMESTOP, they called it in Newspeak.He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He presented himself withpropositions--'the Party says the earth is flat', 'the party says thatice is heavier than water'--and trained himself in not seeing or notunderstanding the arguments that contradicted them. It was not easy.It needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmeticalproblems raised, for instance, by such a statement as 'two and two makefive' were beyond his intellectual grasp. It needed also a sort ofathleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicateuse of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logicalerrors. Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult toattain.All the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how soon they wouldshoot him. 'Everything depends on yourself,' O'Brien had said; but he knewthat there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer. Itmight be ten minutes hence, or ten years. They might keep him for years insolitary confinement, they might send him to a labour-camp, they mightrelease him for a while, as they sometimes did. It was perfectly possiblethat before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogationwould be enacted all over again. The one certain thing was that deathnever came at an expected moment. The tradition--the unspoken tradition:somehow you knew it, though you never heard it said--was that they shotyou from behind; always in the back of the head, without warning, as youwalked down a corridor from cell to cell.One day--but 'one day' was not the right expression; just as probably itwas in the middle of the night: once--he fell into a strange, blissfulreverie. He was walking down the corridor, waiting for the bullet. He knewthat it was coming in another moment. Everything was settled, smoothedout, reconciled. There were no more doubts, no more arguments, no morepain, no more fear. His body was healthy and strong. He walked easily,with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. He wasnot any longer in the narrow white corridors in the Ministry of Love, hewas in the enormous sunlit passage, a kilometre wide, down which he hadseemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs. He was in the GoldenCountry, following the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture.He could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshineon his face. At the edge of the field were the elm trees, faintly stirring,and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the greenpools under the willows.Suddenly he started up with a shock of horror. The sweat broke out on hisbackbone. He had heard himself cry aloud:'Julia! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia!'For a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence. Shehad seemed to be not merely with him, but inside him. It was as though shehad got into the texture of his skin. In that moment he had loved her farmore than he had ever done when they were together and free. Also he knewthat somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help.He lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. What had he done? Howmany years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness?In another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside. They could notlet such an outburst go unpunished. They would know now, if they had notknown before, that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them.He obeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old days he hadhidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity. Now he hadretreated a step further: in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hopedto keep the inner heart inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, buthe preferred to be in the wrong. They would understand that--O'Brien wouldunderstand it. It was all confessed in that single foolish cry.He would have to start all over again. It might take years. He ran a handover his face, trying to familiarize himself with the new shape. Therewere deep furrows in the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the noseflattened. Besides, since last seeing himself in the glass he had beengiven a complete new set of teeth. It was not easy to preserveinscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like. In anycase, mere control of the features was not enough. For the first time heperceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it fromyourself. You must know all the while that it is there, but until it isneeded you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shapethat could be given a name. From now onwards he must not only think right;he must feel right, dream right. And all the while he must keep his hatredlocked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself andyet unconnected with the rest of him, a kind of cyst.One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not tell when it wouldhappen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess. Itwas always from behind, walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would beenough. In that time the world inside him could turn over. And thensuddenly, without a word uttered, without a check in his step, without thechanging of a line in his face--suddenly the camouflage would be down andbang! would go the batteries of his hatred. Hatred would fill him like anenormous roaring flame. And almost in the same instant bang! would go thebullet, too late, or too early. They would have blown his brain to piecesbefore they could reclaim it. The heretical thought would be unpunished,unrepented, out of their reach for ever. They would have blown a hole intheir own perfection. To die hating them, that was freedom.He shut his eyes. It was more difficult than accepting an intellectualdiscipline. It was a question of degrading himself, mutilating himself. Hehad got to plunge into the filthiest of filth. What was the most horrible,sickening thing of all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous face(because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it asbeing a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache and the eyes thatfollowed you to and fro, seemed to float into his mind of its own accord.What were his true feelings towards Big Brother?There was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. The steel door swung openwith a clang. O'Brien walked into the cell. Behind him were the waxen-facedofficer and the black-uniformed guards.'Get up,' said O'Brien. 'Come here.'Winston stood opposite him. O'Brien took Winston's shoulders between hisstrong hands and looked at him closely.'You have had thoughts of deceiving me,' he said. 'That was stupid.Stand up straighter. Look me in the face.'He paused, and went on in a gentler tone:'You are improving. Intellectually there is very little wrong with you.It is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress. Tell me,Winston--and remember, no lies: you know that I am always able to detecta lie--tell me, what are your true feelings towards Big Brother?''I hate him.''You hate him. Good. Then the time has come for you to take the last step.You must love Big Brother. It is not enough to obey him: you must lovehim.'He released Winston with a little push towards the guards.'Room 101,' he said.Chapter 5At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed to know,whereabouts he was in the windowless building. Possibly there were slightdifferences in the air pressure. The cells where the guards had beaten himwere below ground level. The room where he had been interrogated byO'Brien was high up near the roof. This place was many metres underground,as deep down as it was possible to go.It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he hardly noticedhis surroundings. All he noticed was that there were two small tablesstraight in front of him, each covered with green baize. One was only ametre or two from him, the other was further away, near the door. He wasstrapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, noteven his head. A sort of pad gripped his head from behind, forcing him tolook straight in front of him.For a moment he was alone, then the door opened and O'Brien came in.'You asked me once,' said O'Brien, 'what was in Room 101. I told you thatyou knew the answer already. Everyone knows it. The thing that is inRoom 101 is the worst thing in the world.'The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying something made of wire,a box or basket of some kind. He set it down on the further table. Becauseof the position in which O'Brien was standing. Winston could not see whatthe thing was.'The worst thing in the world,' said O'Brien, 'varies from individual toindividual. It may be burial alive, or death by fire, or by drowning, orby impalement, or fifty other deaths. There are cases where it is somequite trivial thing, not even fatal.'He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a better view ofthe thing on the table. It was an oblong wire cage with a handle on topfor carrying it by. Fixed to the front of it was something that lookedlike a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. Although it was threeor four metres away from him, he could see that the cage was dividedlengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind of creaturein each. They were rats.'In your case,' said O'Brien, 'the worst thing in the world happens to berats.'A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, hadpassed through Winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage.But at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of itsuddenly sank into him. His bowels seemed to turn to water.'You can't do that!' he cried out in a high cracked voice. 'You couldn't,you couldn't! It's impossible.''Do you remember,' said O'Brien, 'the moment of panic that used to occurin your dreams? There was a wall of blackness in front of you, and aroaring sound in your ears. There was something terrible on the other sideof the wall. You knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag itinto the open. It was the rats that were on the other side of the wall.''O'Brien!' said Winston, making an effort to control his voice. 'You knowthis is not necessary. What is it that you want me to do?'O'Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was in the schoolmasterishmanner that he sometimes affected. He looked thoughtfully into thedistance, as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behindWinston's back.'By itself,' he said, 'pain is not always enough. There are occasions whena human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death.But for everyone there is something unendurable--something that cannot becontemplated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you are fallingfrom a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you have come upfrom deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air. It ismerely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. It is the same with therats. For you, they are unendurable. They are a form of pressure that youcannot withstand, even if you wished to. You will do what is required ofyou.''But what is it, what is it? How can I do it if I don't know what it is?'O'Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table.He set it down carefully on the baize cloth. Winston could hear the bloodsinging in his ears. He had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness.He was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched withsunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances.Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him. They wereenormous rats. They were at the age when a rat's muzzle grows blunt andfierce and his fur brown instead of grey.'The rat,' said O'Brien, still addressing his invisible audience,'although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware of that. You will haveheard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town. In somestreets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house, even for fiveminutes. The rats are certain to attack it. Within quite a small time theywill strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or dying people. Theyshow astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless.'There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed to reach Winstonfrom far away. The rats were fighting; they were trying to get at eachother through the partition. He heard also a deep groan of despair.That, too, seemed to come from outside himself.O'Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed something in it.There was a sharp click. Winston made a frantic effort to tear himselfloose from the chair. It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head,was held immovably. O'Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than ametre from Winston's face.'I have pressed the first lever,' said O'Brien. 'You understand theconstruction of this cage. The mask will fit over your head, leaving noexit. When I press this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up.These starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets. Have you everseen a rat leap through the air? They will leap on to your face and borestraight into it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first. Sometimes theyburrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue.'The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a succession ofshrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head. Buthe fought furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even with asplit second left--to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul mustyodour of the brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion ofnausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Everything had goneblack. For an instant he was insane, a screaming animal. Yet he came outof the blackness clutching an idea. There was one and only one way to savehimself. He must interpose another human being, the BODY of another humanbeing, between himself and the rats.The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision ofanything else. The wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face. Therats knew what was coming now. One of them was leaping up and down, theother, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pinkhands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston could seethe whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the black panic took hold of him.He was blind, helpless, mindless.'It was a common punishment in Imperial China,' said O'Brien asdidactically as ever.The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his cheek. And then--no,it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. Too late, perhapstoo late. But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there wasjust ONE person to whom he could transfer his punishment--ONE body that hecould thrust between himself and the rats. And he was shouting frantically,over and over.'Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't care what you doto her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!'He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. He wasstill strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor, throughthe walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, throughthe atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars--alwaysaway, away, away from the rats. He was light years distant, but O'Brienwas still standing at his side. There was still the cold touch of wireagainst his cheek. But through the darkness that enveloped him he heardanother metallic click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shut andnot open.Chapter 6The Chestnut Tree was almost empty. A ray of sunlight slanting through awindow fell on dusty table-tops. It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Atinny music trickled from the telescreens.Winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. Now and againhe glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall.BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came andfilled his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into it a few drops fromanother bottle with a quill through the cork. It was saccharine flavouredwith cloves, the speciality of the cafe.Winston was listening to the telescreen. At present only music was comingout of it, but there was a possibility that at any moment there might bea special bulletin from the Ministry of Peace. The news from the Africanfront was disquieting in the extreme. On and off he had been worryingabout it all day. A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war with Eurasia:Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia) was moving southward atterrifying speed. The mid-day bulletin had not mentioned any definitearea, but it was probable that already the mouth of the Congo was abattlefield. Brazzaville and Leopoldville were in danger. One did not haveto look at the map to see what it meant. It was not merely a question oflosing Central Africa: for the first time in the whole war, the territoryof Oceania itself was menaced.A violent emotion, not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiatedexcitement, flared up in him, then faded again. He stopped thinking aboutthe war. In these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject formore than a few moments at a time. He picked up his glass and drained itat a gulp. As always, the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly.The stuff was horrible. The cloves and saccharine, themselves disgustingenough in their sickly way, could not disguise the flat oily smell; andwhat was worst of all was that the smell of gin, which dwelt with himnight and day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell ofthose----He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far as it was possiblehe never visualized them. They were something that he was half-aware of,hovering close to his face, a smell that clung to his nostrils. As the ginrose in him he belched through purple lips. He had grown fatter since theyreleased him, and had regained his old colour--indeed, more than regainedit. His features had thickened, the skin on nose and cheekbones wascoarsely red, even the bald scalp was too deep a pink. A waiter, againunbidden, brought the chessboard and the current issue of 'The Times',with the page turned down at the chess problem. Then, seeing that Winston'sglass was empty, he brought the gin bottle and filled it. There was noneed to give orders. They knew his habits. The chessboard was alwayswaiting for him, his corner table was always reserved; even when the placewas full he had it to himself, since nobody cared to be seen sitting tooclose to him. He never even bothered to count his drinks. At irregularintervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they saidwas the bill, but he had the impression that they always undercharged him.It would have made no difference if it had been the other way about. Hehad always plenty of money nowadays. He even had a job, a sinecure, morehighly-paid than his old job had been.The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over. Winston raisedhis head to listen. No bulletins from the front, however. It was merely abrief announcement from the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding quarter,it appeared, the Tenth Three-Year Plan's quota for bootlaces had beenoverfulfilled by 98 per cent.He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It was a trickyending, involving a couple of knights. 'White to play and mate in twomoves.' Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother. White alwaysmates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, withoutexception, it is so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning ofthe world has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvaryingtriumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calmpower. White always mates.The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and muchgraver tone: 'You are warned to stand by for an important announcement atfifteen-thirty. Fifteen-thirty! This is news of the highest importance.Take care not to miss it. Fifteen-thirty!' The tinkling music struck upagain.Winston's heart stirred. That was the bulletin from the front; instincttold him that it was bad news that was coming. All day, with little spurtsof excitement, the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa had been in andout of his mind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarmingacross the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africalike a column of ants. Why had it not been possible to outflank them insome way? The outline of the West African coast stood out vividly in hismind. He picked up the white knight and moved it across the board. THEREwas the proper spot. Even while he saw the black horde racing southward hesaw another force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted in their rear,cutting their communications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it hewas bringing that other force into existence. But it was necessary to actquickly. If they could get control of the whole of Africa, if they hadairfields and submarine bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in two. Itmight mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, thedestruction of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinary medleyof feeling--but it was not a medley, exactly; rather it was successivelayers of feeling, in which one could not say which layer wasundermost--struggled inside him.The spasm passed. He put the white knight back in its place, but for themoment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem.His thoughts wandered again. Almost unconsciously he traced with hisfinger in the dust on the table:2+2=5'They can't get inside you,' she had said. But they could get inside you.'What happens to you here is FOR EVER,' O'Brien had said. That was a trueword. There were things, your own acts, from which you could never recover.Something was killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out.He had seen her; he had even spoken to her. There was no danger in it. Heknew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in hisdoings. He could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of themhad wanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. It was in thePark, on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth was like iron andall the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a fewcrocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. Hewas hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her notten metres away from him. It struck him at once that she had changed insome ill-defined way. They almost passed one another without a sign, thenhe turned and followed her, not very eagerly. He knew that there was nodanger, nobody would take any interest in him. She did not speak. Shewalked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him,then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side. Presently theywere in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs, useless either forconcealment or as protection from the wind. They halted. It was vilelycold. The wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional,dirty-looking crocuses. He put his arm round her waist.There was no telescreen, but there must be hidden microphones: besides,they could be seen. It did not matter, nothing mattered. They could havelain down on the ground and done THAT if they had wanted to. His fleshfroze with horror at the thought of it. She made no response whatever tothe clasp of his arm; she did not even try to disengage herself. He knewnow what had changed in her. Her face was sallower, and there was a longscar, partly hidden by the hair, across her forehead and temple; but thatwas not the change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in asurprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how once, after the explosionof a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins, andhad been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing, but byits rigidity and awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more like stonethan flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to him that the textureof her skin would be quite different from what it had once been.He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As they walked backacross the grass, she looked directly at him for the first time. Itwas only a momentary glance, full of contempt and dislike. He wonderedwhether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether itwas inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind keptsqueezing from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, side by sidebut not too close together. He saw that she was about to speak. She movedher clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig. Herfeet seemed to have grown broader, he noticed.'I betrayed you,' she said baldly.'I betrayed you,' he said.She gave him another quick look of dislike.'Sometimes,' she said, 'they threaten you with something something youcan't stand up to, can't even think about. And then you say, "Don't do itto me, do it to somebody else, do it to so-and-so." And perhaps you mightpretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it tomake them stop and didn't really mean it. But that isn't true. At the timewhen it happens you do mean it. You think there's no other way of savingyourself, and you're quite ready to save yourself that way. You WANT it tohappen to the other person. You don't give a damn what they suffer. Allyou care about is yourself.''All you care about is yourself,' he echoed.'And after that, you don't feel the same towards the other person anylonger.''No,' he said, 'you don't feel the same.'There did not seem to be anything more to say. The wind plastered theirthin overalls against their bodies. Almost at once it became embarrassingto sit there in silence: besides, it was too cold to keep still. She saidsomething about catching her Tube and stood up to go.'We must meet again,' he said.'Yes,' she said, 'we must meet again.'He followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace behind her.They did not speak again. She did not actually try to shake him off, butwalked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her.He had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the Tubestation, but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemedpointless and unbearable. He was overwhelmed by a desire not so much toget away from Julia as to get back to the Chestnut Tree Cafe, which hadnever seemed so attractive as at this moment. He had a nostalgic visionof his corner table, with the newspaper and the chessboard and theever-flowing gin. Above all, it would be warm in there. The next moment,not altogether by accident, he allowed himself to become separated fromher by a small knot of people. He made a half-hearted attempt to catch up,then slowed down, turned, and made off in the opposite direction. When hehad gone fifty metres he looked back. The street was not crowded, butalready he could not distinguish her. Any one of a dozen hurrying figuresmight have been hers. Perhaps her thickened, stiffened body was no longerrecognizable from behind.'At the time when it happens,' she had said, 'you do mean it.' He hadmeant it. He had not merely said it, he had wished it. He had wished thatshe and not he should be delivered over to the----Something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen. Acracked and jeering note, a yellow note, came into it. And then--perhapsit was not happening, perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblanceof sound--a voice was singing:  'Under the spreading chestnut tree  I sold you and you sold me----'The tears welled up in his eyes. A passing waiter noticed that his glasswas empty and came back with the gin bottle.He took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff grew not less but morehorrible with every mouthful he drank. But it had become the element heswam in. It was his life, his death, and his resurrection. It was gin thatsank him into stupor every night, and gin that revived him every morning.When he woke, seldom before eleven hundred, with gummed-up eyelids andfiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken, it would have beenimpossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for thebottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight. Through the middayhours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy, listening to thetelescreen. From fifteen to closing-time he was a fixture in the ChestnutTree. No one cared what he did any longer, no whistle woke him, notelescreen admonished him. Occasionally, perhaps twice a week, he wentto a dusty, forgotten-looking office in the Ministry of Truth and dida little work, or what was called work. He had been appointed to asub-committee of a sub-committee which had sprouted from one of theinnumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in thecompilation of the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. They wereengaged in producing something called an Interim Report, but what it wasthat they were reporting on he had never definitely found out. It wassomething to do with the question of whether commas should be placedinside brackets, or outside. There were four others on the committee, allof them persons similar to himself. There were days when they assembledand then promptly dispersed again, frankly admitting to one another thatthere was not really anything to be done. But there were other days whenthey settled down to their work almost eagerly, making a tremendous showof entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were neverfinished--when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing aboutgrew extraordinarily involved and abstruse, with subtle haggling overdefinitions, enormous digressions, quarrels--threats, even, to appeal tohigher authority. And then suddenly the life would go out of them andthey would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes,like ghosts fading at cock-crow.The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raised his head again. Thebulletin! But no, they were merely changing the music. He had the map ofAfrica behind his eyelids. The movement of the armies was a diagram: ablack arrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow horizontallyeastward, across the tail of the first. As though for reassurance helooked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait. Was it conceivablethat the second arrow did not even exist?His interest flagged again. He drank another mouthful of gin, picked upthe white knight and made a tentative move. Check. But it was evidentlynot the right move, because----Uncalled, a memory floated into his mind. He saw a candle-lit room with avast white-counterpaned bed, and himself, a boy of nine or ten, sitting onthe floor, shaking a dice-box, and laughing excitedly. His mother wassitting opposite him and also laughing.It must have been about a month before she disappeared. It was a moment ofreconciliation, when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and hisearlier affection for her had temporarily revived. He remembered the daywell, a pelting, drenching day when the water streamed down the window-paneand the light indoors was too dull to read by. The boredom of the twochildren in the dark, cramped bedroom became unbearable. Winston whinedand grizzled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the room pullingeverything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighboursbanged on the wall, while the younger child wailed intermittently. In theend his mother said, 'Now be good, and I'll buy you a toy. A lovelytoy--you'll love it'; and then she had gone out in the rain, to a littlegeneral shop which was still sporadically open nearby, and came back witha cardboard box containing an outfit of Snakes and Ladders. He could stillremember the smell of the damp cardboard. It was a miserable outfit. Theboard was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that theywould hardly lie on their sides. Winston looked at the thing sulkily andwithout interest. But then his mother lit a piece of candle and they satdown on the floor to play. Soon he was wildly excited and shouting withlaughter as the tiddly-winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and thencame slithering down the snakes again, almost to the starting-point. Theyplayed eight games, winning four each. His tiny sister, too young tounderstand what the game was about, had sat propped up against a bolster,laughing because the others were laughing. For a whole afternoon they hadall been happy together, as in his earlier childhood.He pushed the picture out of his mind. It was a false memory. He wastroubled by false memories occasionally. They did not matter so long asone knew them for what they were. Some things had happened, others had nothappened. He turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knightagain. Almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with aclatter. He had started as though a pin had run into him.A shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air. It was the bulletin! Victory!It always meant victory when a trumpet-call preceded the news. A sort ofelectric drill ran through the cafe. Even the waiters had started andpricked up their ears.The trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume of noise. Already anexcited voice was gabbling from the telescreen, but even as it startedit was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside. The news hadrun round the streets like magic. He could hear just enough of what wasissuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened, as he hadforeseen; a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow inthe enemy's rear, the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black.Fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din: 'Vaststrategic manoeuvre--perfect co-ordination--utter rout--half a millionprisoners--complete demoralization--control of the whole of Africa--bringthe war within measurable distance of its end--victory--greatest victoryin human history--victory, victory, victory!'Under the table Winston's feet made convulsive movements. He had notstirred from his seat, but in his mind he was running, swiftly running,he was with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf. He looked up againat the portrait of Big Brother. The colossus that bestrode the world!The rock against which the hordes of Asia dashed themselves in vain! Hethought how ten minutes ago--yes, only ten minutes--there had still beenequivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the frontwould be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was more than a Eurasian army thathad perished! Much had changed in him since that first day in the Ministryof Love, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened,until this moment.The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisonersand booty and slaughter, but the shouting outside had died down a little.The waiters were turning back to their work. One of them approached withthe gin bottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attentionas his glass was filled up. He was not running or cheering any longer. Hewas back in the Ministry of Love, with everything forgiven, his soul whiteas snow. He was in the public dock, confessing everything, implicatingeverybody. He was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with the feelingof walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at his back. The long-hoped-forbullet was entering his brain.He gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had taken him to learnwhat kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache. O cruel, needlessmisunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast!Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was allright, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had wonthe victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.THE ENDAPPENDIX.The Principles of NewspeakNewspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meetthe ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the year 1984there was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means ofcommunication, either in speech or writing. The leading articles in'The Times' were written in it, but this was a TOUR DE FORCE which couldonly be carried out by a specialist. It was expected that Newspeak wouldhave finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we shouldcall it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, allParty members tending to use Newspeak words and grammatical constructionsmore and more in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984, andembodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, wasa provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaicformations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the final,perfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary,that we are concerned here.The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expressionfor the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc,but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended thatwhen Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten,a heretical thought--that is, a thought diverging from the principles ofIngsoc--should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought isdependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact andoften very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member couldproperly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also thepossibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partlyby the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirablewords and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, andso far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. To give a singleexample. The word FREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could only beused in such statements as 'This dog is free from lice' or 'This field isfree from weeds'. It could not be used in its old sense of 'politicallyfree' or 'intellectually free' since political and intellectual freedom nolonger existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless.Quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reductionof vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could bedispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extendbut to DIMINISH the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectlyassisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, thoughmany Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words,would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeakwords were divided into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary,the B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary.It will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammaticalpeculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted tothe A vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.THE A VOCABULARY. The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for thebusiness of everyday life--for such things as eating, drinking, working,putting on one's clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles,gardening, cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirely of wordsthat we already possess words like HIT, RUN, DOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE,FIELD--but in comparison with the present-day English vocabulary theirnumber was extremely small, while their meanings were far more rigidlydefined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out ofthem. So far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this class wassimply a staccato sound expressing ONE clearly understood concept. Itwould have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literarypurposes or for political or philosophical discussion. It was intendedonly to express simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concreteobjects or physical actions.The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. The first ofthese was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts ofspeech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to veryabstract words such as IF or WHEN) could be used either as verb, noun,adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they wereof the same root, there was never any variation, this rule of itselfinvolving the destruction of many archaic forms. The word THOUGHT, forexample, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was taken by THINK, whichdid duty for both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followedhere: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention,in other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaningwere not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequentlysuppressed. There was, for example, no such word as CUT, its meaning beingsufficiently covered by the noun-verb KNIFE. Adjectives were formed byadding the suffix -FUL to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding -WISE. Thusfor example, SPEEDFUL meant 'rapid' and SPEEDWISE meant 'quickly'. Certainof our present-day adjectives, such as GOOD, STRONG, BIG, BLACK, SOFT,were retained, but their total number was very small. There was littleneed for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at byadding -FUL to a noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs was retained,except for a very few already ending in -WISE: the -WISE termination wasinvariable. The word WELL, for example, was replaced by GOODWISE.In addition, any word--this again applied in principle to every word inthe language--could be negatived by adding the affix UN-, or could bestrengthened by the affix PLUS-, or, for still greater emphasis,DOUBLEPLUS-. Thus, for example, UNCOLD meant 'warm', while PLUSCOLD andDOUBLEPLUSCOLD meant, respectively, 'very cold' and 'superlatively cold'.It was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning ofalmost any word by prepositional affixes such as ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-,etc. By such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormousdiminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, the word GOOD, there was noneed for such a word as BAD, since the required meaning was equallywell--indeed, better--expressed by UNGOOD. All that was necessary, in anycase where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decidewhich of them to suppress. DARK, for example, could be replaced by UNLIGHT,or LIGHT by UNDARK, according to preference.The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity.Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexionsfollowed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the pastparticiple were the same and ended in -ED. The preterite of STEAL wasSTEALED, the preterite of THINK was THINKED, and so on throughout thelanguage, all such forms as SWAM, GAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc., beingabolished. All plurals were made by adding -S or -ES as the case might be.The plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES, LIFES. Comparison ofadjectives was invariably made by adding -ER, -EST (GOOD, GOODER, GOODEST),irregular forms and the MORE, MOST formation being suppressed.The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularlywere the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and theauxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except thatWHOM had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the SHALL, SHOULD tenses hadbeen dropped, all their uses being covered by WILL and WOULD. There werealso certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need forrapid and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liableto be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionallytherefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a wordor an archaic formation was retained. But this need made itself feltchiefly in connexion with the B vocabulary. WHY so great an importance wasattached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.THE B VOCABULARY. The B vocabulary consisted of words which had beendeliberately constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say,which not only had in every case a political implication, but were intendedto impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Withouta full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to usethese words correctly. In some cases they could be translated intoOldspeak, or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usuallydemanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certainovertones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packingwhole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time moreaccurate and forcible than ordinary language.The B words were in all cases compound words. [Compound words such asSPEAKWRITE, were of course to be found in the A vocabulary, but these weremerely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colour.]They consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded togetherin an easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was always anoun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a singleexample: the word GOODTHINK, meaning, very roughly, 'orthodoxy', or, ifone chose to regard it as a verb, 'to think in an orthodox manner'. Thisinflected as follows: noun-verb, GOODTHINK; past tense and past participle,GOODTHINKED; present participle, GOOD-THINKING; adjective, GOODTHINKFUL;adverb, GOODTHINKWISE; verbal noun, GOODTHINKER.The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words ofwhich they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placedin any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronouncewhile indicating their derivation. In the word CRIMETHINK (thoughtcrime),for instance, the THINK came second, whereas in THINKPOL (Thought Police)it came first, and in the latter word POLICE had lost its second syllable.Because of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formationswere commoner in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example,the adjective forms of MINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively,MINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY, simply because -TRUEFUL,-PAXFUL, and -LOVEFUL were slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle,however, all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly thesame way.Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible toanyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, for example,such a typical sentence from a 'Times' leading article as OLDTHINKERSUNBELLYFEEL INGSOC. The shortest rendering that one could make of thisin Oldspeak would be: 'Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolutioncannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of EnglishSocialism.' But this is not an adequate translation. To begin with, inorder to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above,one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by INGSOC. And inaddition, only a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciatethe full force of the word BELLYFEEL, which implied a blind, enthusiasticacceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word OLDTHINK, which wasinextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence. But thespecial function of certain Newspeak words, of which OLDTHINK was one,was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. These words,necessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until theycontained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they weresufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrappedand forgotten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the NewspeakDictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to makesure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of wordsthey cancelled by their existence.As we have already seen in the case of the word FREE, words which hadonce borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake ofconvenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them.Countless other words such as HONOUR, JUSTICE, MORALITY, INTERNATIONALISM,DEMOCRACY, SCIENCE, and RELIGION had simply ceased to exist. A few blanketwords covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All wordsgrouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, forinstance, were contained in the single word CRIMETHINK, while all wordsgrouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalismwere contained in the single word OLDTHINK. Greater precision would havebeen dangerous. What was required in a Party member was an outlook similarto that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, thatall nations other than his own worshipped 'false gods'. He did not need toknow that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and thelike: probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy.He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore, thatall gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. In somewhatthe same way, the party member knew what constituted right conduct, and inexceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure fromit were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated bythe two Newspeak words SEXCRIME (sexual immorality) and GOODSEX (chastity).SEXCRIME covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication,adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normalintercourse practised for its own sake. There was no need to enumeratethem separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle,all punishable by death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientificand technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names tocertain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had no need of them.He knew what was meant by GOODSEX--that is to say, normal intercoursebetween man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, andwithout physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was SEXCRIME.In Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought furtherthan the perception that it WAS heretical: beyond that point the necessarywords were nonexistent.No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. A great many wereeuphemisms. Such words, for instance, as JOYCAMP (forced-labour camp) orMINIPAX (Ministry of Peace, i.e. Ministry of War) meant almost the exactopposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other hand,displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature ofOceanic society. An example was PROLEFEED, meaning the rubbishyentertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses.Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation 'good' whenapplied to the Party and 'bad' when applied to its enemies. But inaddition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appearedto be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour notfrom their meaning, but from their structure.So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might havepolitical significance of any kind was fitted into the B vocabulary. Thename of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, orinstitution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiarshape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest numberof syllables that would preserve the original derivation. In the Ministryof Truth, for example, the Records Department, in which Winston Smithworked, was called RECDEP, the Fiction Department was called FICDEP, theTeleprogrammes Department was called TELEDEP, and so on. This was notdone solely with the object of saving time. Even in the early decades ofthe twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of thecharacteristic features of political language; and it had been noticedthat the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked intotalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations. Examples were suchwords as NAZI, GESTAPO, COMINTERN, INPRECORR, AGITPROP. In the beginningthe practice had been adopted as it were instinctively, but in Newspeakit was used with a conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thusabbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, bycutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it.The words COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL, for instance, call up a compositepicture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, Karl Marx,and the Paris Commune. The word COMINTERN, on the other hand, suggestsmerely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine.It refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited inpurpose, as a chair or a table. COMINTERN is a word that can be utteredalmost without taking thought, whereas COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL is a phraseover which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way,the associations called up by a word like MINITRUE are fewer and morecontrollable than those called up by MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accounted notonly for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for thealmost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easilypronounceable.In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitudeof meaning. Regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when itseemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all forpolitical purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning whichcould be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in thespeaker's mind. The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force fromthe fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariablythese words--GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED, SEXCRIME, JOYCAMP, INGSOC,BELLYFEEL, THINKPOL, and countless others--were words of two or threesyllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllableand the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, atonce staccato and monotonous. And this was exactly what was aimed at. Theintention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject notideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness.For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimesnecessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon tomake a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth thecorrect opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets.His training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almostfoolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh soundand a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit ofIngsoc, assisted the process still further.So did the fact of having very few words to choose from. Relative to ourown, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it wereconstantly being devised. Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all otherlanguages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger everyyear. Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice,the smaller the temptation to take thought. Ultimately it was hoped tomake articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higherbrain centres at all. This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak wordDUCKSPEAK, meaning 'to quack like a duck'. Like various other words inthe B vocabulary, DUCKSPEAK was ambivalent in meaning. Provided that theopinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing butpraise, and when 'The Times' referred to one of the orators of the Partyas a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER it was paying a warm and valued compliment.THE C VOCABULARY. The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others andconsisted entirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled thescientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots,but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them ofundesirable meanings. They followed the same grammatical rules as thewords in the other two vocabularies. Very few of the C words had anycurrency either in everyday speech or in political speech. Any scientificworker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devotedto his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of thewords occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words were common toall lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Scienceas a habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particularbranches. There was, indeed, no word for 'Science', any meaning that itcould possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word INGSOC.From the foregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expressionof unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible.It was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, aspecies of blasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to sayBIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merelyconveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained byreasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. Ideasinimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form,and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together andcondemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so.One could, in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes byillegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. Forexample, ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeak sentence, but onlyin the same sense in which ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeaksentence. It did not contain a grammatical error, but it expresseda palpable untruth--i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, orstrength. The concept of political equality no longer existed, and thissecondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word EQUAL.In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication,the danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one mightremember their original meanings. In practice it was not difficult forany person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK to avoid doing this, but withina couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would havevanished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would nomore know that EQUAL had once had the secondary meaning of 'politicallyequal', or that FREE had once meant 'intellectually free', than forinstance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of thesecondary meanings attaching to QUEEN and ROOK. There would be manycrimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit, simplybecause they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to beforeseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristicsof Newspeak would become more and more pronounced--its words growingfewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance ofputting them to improper uses always diminishing.When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link withthe past would have been severed. History had already been rewritten,but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there,imperfectly censored, and so long as one retained one's knowledge ofOldspeak it was possible to read them. In the future such fragments, evenif they chanced to survive, would be unintelligible and untranslatable.It was impossible to translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unlessit either referred to some technical process or some very simple everydayaction, or was already orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL would be the Newspeakexpression) in tendency. In practice this meant that no book written beforeapproximately 1960 could be translated as a whole. Pre-revolutionaryliterature could only be subjected to ideological translation--that is,alteration in sense as well as language. Take for example the well-knownpassage from the Declaration of Independence:WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL,THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS,THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.THAT TO SECURE THESE RIGHTS, GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN,DERIVING THEIR POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED. THAT WHENEVERANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THOSE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHTOF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT...It would have been quite impossible to render this into Newspeak whilekeeping to the sense of the original. The nearest one could come to doingso would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word CRIMETHINK.A full translation could only be an ideological translation, wherebyJefferson's words would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government.A good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, already beingtransformed in this way. Considerations of prestige made it desirable topreserve the memory of certain historical figures, while at the same timebringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc.Various writers, such as Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Byron, Dickens, andsome others were therefore in process of translation: when the task hadbeen completed, their original writings, with all else that survived ofthe literature of the past, would be destroyed. These translations werea slow and difficult business, and it was not expected that they wouldbe finished before the first or second decade of the twenty-firstcentury. There were also large quantities of merely utilitarianliterature--indispensable technical manuals, and the like--that had tobe treated in the same way. It was chiefly in order to allow time forthe preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of Newspeakhad been fixed for so late a date as 2050.THE ENDProject Gutenberg Australia==============================================================Guild: Direct MessagesChannel: xtnctn==============================================================i agree with your display namefrom:uwudwagonl has:unborn childyoull find it...YESIM LSITENINGTHE FUCK IS HIS CUM BOOK????????????????????please tell me what the fucking cum book isand ill tell you his full name.can i see proof of him admitting to thatdid he say he has a book like thatill tell you bennys name if you give me a funny benny screenshotroblox cockwhy did you ghostpingdo you want my furry scat porn or smtill send you that if you ghostping me again🇳🇮🇬🇬🇪🇷Pixel Lexbex of the yexcexzexzexzex да ли бисте изгубили нах ид победилиwhat?????????????????????????????????????someone pinged me in dms 6 timeseither you or the midget?untimeout mecan you ask zelda 🥺like 10% donemy monkey died :(make a miserable zeldalord skini wanna use itdm me itlike my current skin btw?ok im gonna use itmexico jexicothis is what he did.never going on kysblock again.you dont deserve to liveLMAOI FOUND THAT A BIT AGOHello, Pixelyou are going to pay for the pain you have caused me.open at your own risk, but you deserve to see itnostop lurking in pjtraffic incidents from my exact area show up hereanyway i told zelda to 3am you :Dhf :Du cant i tried way too mucheven with vpni couldnti am in siberia right nowand it shows me shit from my areasend me all your adachi shit i need to torture a skyblock player and adachi is the most insufferable thing ive witnessed in yearsnot enoughalr sent all thatwhat the fuck is the 3rd onewhythe person i was trolling sent me adachi porn now im killing myselfthis is why you dont interact with skyblock sweatssend to zeldakashimonot nsfw just weirdno.whatwatch thisdid you watch the videodo i?oneshot is offnot that helli am buying oneshot in like an hour or somethingwhy the fuck did some people tell me its 4h and some its 15hare the ones that said 15h just very very very very very shit at it?im not streaming itits completeable today righti hope oneshot isnt lethal company v2everyone praises it but i utterly despise itis it one of those games where community is insane but the base game has no degen shiti dont wanna see anything like this in the gamemade me quit instantlyyeai hit the dummy becuase i hate ralseithen he fucking says THATyou act like i know the lore implicationsim yet to buy undertalethats wasnt something i wanted to knowhow does that mean theyre the same personwerent 2 chapters released and nothing afterwhy are you the 3rd person to tell me thatisnt it a fan gamegenocide sounds fun thowhat about normal undertalesame boss or whatoh so do i have to do bothso do pacifist first then genocide?for which gameut or utyare there routes and shit in oneshotsame game or seperate or whatis it included in the 4h of oneshotso whats total ptis the game like normalwithout weird moments like ralseitheres no ralsei characters righti mean oneshotwhy does niko look so weird thoevery fucking degen furry has a niko pfpis niko weird like ralsei or nocredit card didnt work so i buy it tmr morningim looking for the RhynioGYATha7h 3 dino resets and i found noneand i need a max level oneits level 6-180 btwwhatboughtoneshotwhy is niko taking alcohol does he want to get drunk???no i just got to the basementwhy is a lightbulb the sun is the game stupid???

look FIREhe overdosed on element (an alien material with insane properties) to ascend but instead of becoming one of the evolved ascended humans who live outside space and probably time too  but instead became trapped in the programming of a failing ark forever stuck as the guardian of it (the boss survivors need to defeat to ascend) putting him in an infinite loop of death foreverhelpi tried putting both my official atlus adachi dildos up my ass at the same time and theyre stuckit feels like my rectum is gonna implodeyou hate ark right?lets try this to see if ark is peak or slopGOOD MORNINGIS THERE PVP TAMING AND BOSSES IN RAIN WORLD@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@Pixel@PixelTAMING???ALSO ANY DINOSAURS??ANY RIDEABLE SHIT??GRINDING LEVELS?RNG IN CREATURE LEVELS?ok bossesare there bosses you have to grind a ton foroh its not an arklikeboringslopwith that lore i wouldve thought its actually good but nois it at least mainly focus on survivaland purely survivalark is a fabricated ecosystemthese are the arksthis is where the final boss istherye called overseerstheyre there on every mapon the current map im playing the survivors somehow destroyed that area and it killed the dome around it and now during days the surface is so hot that its an instakill if you go therethe surface is also full of "reapers"anything as cool as this in rw?show me some creative insane rw designsive already seen echos and their designs are insanely goodwhat the fuckii meanaccording to my theory which is probably trueearth SEVERELY fucked up and humans went extinctthen weird ais took dna of humans from all time periods and put them on these space stations to survive and adapt and at some point get sent to back to earth to rescue it from idfk whatsame for the evolved humans imp retty surethats not official name official name is prob betterall the ark lore i yap up is schizo theories(i dont spoil myself on peak)do you wanna know what i get whats at this point probably 100 hours of schizophrenia theorycrafting from?Once your fall is complete, stay close to the sanctuaries. Within them, small pockets of life still flourish in an otherwise barren garden. Beyond their spheres of influence, you will find an endless sea of decay, ruled by shadows and death.The first of these sanctuaries is the Great City. Though it is no longer a metropolis, a jungle blooms in its place, and you may find a modicum of shelter within its crumbling walls.The others will be more familiar to you, if only for the towers you'll find at their center. Those are the source of their power - the Obelisks. They are not quite the same as the ones you're familiar with, not quite as advanced, but that's to be expected. They're an older model. Precursors, or more aptly: prototypes.Cause and effect is the way of the universe. Everything must start somewhere. In the case of the System, this is where it was born. You will fall right into its cradle.Together, the sanctuaries and the Obelisks that power them are the ancestor of every island that floats in the sky. They can all can trace their origins back to this single prototype. Though it is flightless, the core principles and technology behind it are the same.In a way, that makes it your ancestor too. You were all born within the System, after all. Even if your design is somewhat altered, in a way, you're all its children.One could say that when you fall, it will be something of a homecoming. In more ways than one.these 2 thingsthats allthis is by what i presume to be the evolved human version of the main character (not the playable character the dossiers writer)ark has the same thingvia explorer notesone of the evolved humans has explorer notes on the first 2 maps so definitely on the third one tooand their shit all points to the 4th and most important map extinctionone of the notes on map 2 was for aberration the third map thosystem born = earthfall = go from the arks in space to earthsanctuaries = the city and the 2 prototype hot and cold arksancestors = as i said prototype arks flightless = very early stages of the arks shit as the island extinction note says so theyre on the ground as domes your ancestor = humanity extinct as evident by the hologram model of earth being completely fuckedborn within the system = humanity extinct and its just dna of random people across earth from all timeframes being uploaded to whatever the fuck the system is design altered = survivors are literally DATA that can be uploaded and the implants presumably have it all stored but theyre still humans and have human dnawhen you fall = sent to extinction aka earth homecoming more ways than one = both humans SOMEHOW repopulating a destroyed earth (the main thing i havent figured out yet) and the system is presumably hosted on earth so both the humanity and the ark tech fuckery return to earth and the prototype arksif there was a physical copy of arkactually it probably existsi would fuck iti wanna nut on thistell zelda this is his favorite placeshow me a band luh nigga@Pixel im crying for peak fictionITS HATCHING PIXEL ITS HATCHINGholy shitthe sound of the acs in ark block it out in the medal clip butthe fucking music sync was insane with the rock drake hatchingflochrock drake yippie :DDDD - Clipped with Medal.tvWatch rock drake yippie :DDDD and millions of other ARK: Survival Evolved videos on Medal, the largest Game Clip Platform.im quitting

sense and its only on first mapyou can choose to ascend on gamma, beta or alpha and alpha is the hardest oneand theres achievements for each ascensionbut if you do alpha you dont get the achievements for gamma and beta.(the only difference is gamma gives 5 levels, beta 10 levels and alpha 15 levels)also this that nobody doesand this requires you to beat every map and grind for hundreds of hours afterits stupid.any spoilers or dcan i watchhow hard is the gameplay btwof rwis it scorched earth level (dying 45 times in the first 10 minutes and over 200 times in first few hours)do you keep inventory and shitafter deathoh ok great no lossbtwcan u savescum.WHATanyway i assumerw is like surface runsu do shit, explore then need to get the fuck underground or under cover before you get burned alivewymcan you technically pirate itgreatcan i use pirated downpour with steam rwso i went on redditto read about rw lore specifically ascension and void fluidWHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLEexplain everything about void worms thanksi cant understand how they live in the literal void seawhat are they trulyhow could something live in the void and live off the void thoare they fully biological or whathow is it possiblethat void worms dont dissolveoh that makes sensewhen the void worm pulls u in its probably to the very bottomand no matter how deep it looks until that pointthe void worms are prob at the surface level stillthose are other slugcats ascending no?or perceived aswhy can you eat neurons of an iteratorarent both 5p and lttm malfunctioningwhere is she thenGGthe oen

beforehandaberration is peak video game and everything else fucking sucksactually hm debateablep3r had a good ending aberration got a bit boring towards the end and the bossfight was a buggy mess the final cinematic was insane thoeven if p3r is better its still up thereis it better than p3 endingidk if ill ever play a better game than p3which characters endingwhen i finished p3r i immediately went to sleep so i wouldnt cryit worked but i still woke up depressedit was like 4 am too loloh i watched the base game ascension already its like an acid tripi also watched a 1h 30 video essay on rw

yetcan u do a eldritch design for itpleasnawhatnoso is he miserablus about itPLEASE dont make it a goth twink but an actual eldritch monsteri hate when designs of cool concepts get reduced to tumblr twinks"god of death and damnation" and his design is thisok hear me out on this onemake it A FUCKTON of armsand make the arms and then his head be this cross shape all togetherand kinda hunched back with the coffin strapped to his backalso incorporate elements of white not just blackmake his skin pure whiteand dont make his head some emo shti make it some eldritch shityoure so unoriginalgo for an uncanny valley feellike 3-4m tall and his limbs humanoid but weirdermake some of his arms 4 or 6 fingersmake them long and slender but still thicker than the average person'sand make his head a complete anomaly maybe something thatd be like a crossbasically like fiends in csmwhere they have some shit bashed into their headdo this melded thing into human head thingbut make it a white or black crossand itd go through the head and end with the chinwhere itd go down from would be like a bullet wound from behind in the headhuhwait this would beso goodbecause you could have the hair go upwards like hair would be if youre laying down in a coffin from the backlike where the coffin isare you going for a general vibe of him being deadwait i just realized.this is a pixelated gamemost of the shit i mentionewould only work with a high res most likely 3d designok you could go with thisvibe of life on him but vibe of death on his outfit@Pixel what kind of personality are you going for for him btw?i have an idea but explain the personality firstis he good or baddoes he wish for deathyea thats what i meantyou could go for the rarely seen approach of deathwhere its just someone guiding the dead towards their endand also if you have any characters dyingmake foreshadowing with himmake interesting interactionswhere he doesnt explicitly say itbut it subtly shows in his sprites and dialogue that someone is near their endoh boring i had this entire ideamake it someone whos just compassionate and kind and wants to guide souls to a (probably) walmart rw ascension without confusion so they safely reach their destinationan interesting trait would be an interaction with someone not ready to die yet and despite him probably seeing a case like that many times still feeling bad about it@Pixel PLEASE make a sea of soulsthat could be so good in a 2d pixel gameand a sick ass pale canoeand he just talks to the person about to die thereyou could also make the cemetery and sea of souls have an interesting traitwhere its just a black white gray color schemeitd add to the atmosphere at least in the guiding to death sceneswhos that character you showed btwmc?whats the setting of the gameoh yea how are you gonna get music for the gamemusic in games like os and ut is so important to the atmosphere@Pixel whats his main facial expression gonna belike in his character model and spritesHEAR ME OUT YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS ITS SUCH A COOL POSElike make his character model when guiding the souls have some kind of lantern like thatand itd be a white lighttrueit could be just a gray sprite of the mcbut how do you give it this translucent sorta vibelike its fadingyou should put that all over the sea of soulsand itd be just this small circle of white light where its kind of visiblefrom the lanternanyways this but hes extending his arm out of the boatkinda like this but shorter arm obvand the trench coat would look very good with thatok what about a gray riverthat leads to itand then its like a waterfall down to itand thats where he parts way with the souland also where you could enter it by interacting with himwhat.is that likethe silksong devwho thenwhy would
